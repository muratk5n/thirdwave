# Part-Time Employees

https://youtu.be/03Ke9rIYGsc?t=48

All those part-time jobs get scored by government as full-time
jobs. That's why were able to generate 200K jobs a month under Obama,
because we had this massive transition in the US economy from
full-time employment to part-time employment. A lot of that was driven
by Obamacare itself, when Obamacare was passed, the law said if you
are employer and you have 50 full-time workers, you have to provide
very expensive health-insurance for every one of your employees. What
that law effectively did was to say that "you are not going to have
more than 50 employees", and employee has to be someone who has to
work full-time, work 30 hours or more. So the employers said okay, we
won't have more than 50 full-time employees.

And it's actually worse. If you own bunch franchises, like say bunch of Mc Donalds [stores], sometimes ppl own more than one restaurant. If I own five restaurants, and collectively all five of my restaurants have 50 employees, I have to pay health insurance for everybody. It's not per restaurant. So ppl who owned a number of these restaurants said I cant have full-time workers [in any of those restaurants]. So all throughout the US employers were transitioning from a full-time work force to a part-time work force because it was too expensive to employ part-time people, because of Obamacare. What does that do to [employment] numbers? All sorts of "jobs" will be created. Look at employment in US, to restaurant industry, waiters, waitresses.. off the charts. We created so many jobs, yet. fewer Americans are eating out.

This is why centrism doesn't work. Their solutions are literally the worst of both worlds. "One the one hand" they are messing with the workings of business.. "on the other hand" they cant even deliver quality, universal social care.
