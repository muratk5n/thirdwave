Nikola Motor Company produces vehicles running on hydrogen fuel-cell
technology. They recently scored a 800-truck deal from
Anheuser-Busch. The company is named after Nikola Tesla, using the
first name of the inventor.  I guess this creates an interesting
rivalry between them and Tesla Inc. who use the last name of the
inventor (it turns out AB's order of 800 from Nikola dwarfs the 20
from Tesla).

They raised a huge sum to build a hydrogen station network. The CEO on
the video boasts over 2 bil $ worth of pre-orders.
