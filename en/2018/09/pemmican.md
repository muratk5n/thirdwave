# Pemmican

Native Americans produced something called pemmican by drying bison
meat and berries, once dried turned it into powder form  stored for a
very long time (one video said that 'it will outlast you'). Pemmican
was a major source of food in America, the white-man jumped into its
trade naturally, through different companies.

Funny story here is the competition got out of hand and certain
factions fought a war over pemmican. Brits had to step in and merge
the two companies. Blimey.
