# Hyundai Nexo

Hyundai jumped onto HFC bandwagon, with its Nexo. The car also has
Level 4 autonomous driving capability, and 600 km range on a full
tank.

Important point to stress: hydrogen stations are needed for fueling
cars, but stations (as well as homes actually) can generate hydrogen
themselves.

Hyundai hedged its bets, they make both battery and HFC based products.

Other news items:

2017, a green energy company Plug Power announced that Amazon [..] had
gained the rights to buy up to 23 percent of the firm, in a deal that
has Amazon spending $70 million in cash for fuel cells [...]. Plug
Power's system [.. replaces] battery charging with proton exchange
membrane (PEM) fuel cells and hydrogen systems designed to make
forklift operation more efficient.

A 2012 video talking about PEM, which requires platinum (expensive),
however recent developments drastically reduced the use of
platinum. Daimler’s new fuel-cell model, the Mercedes GLC F-Cell,
already uses 90 percent less platinum than its previous fuel cell
model, the B-Class F-Cell, [similarly for] Toyota, their Mirai is the
world’s best-selling fuel-cell car.

Toyota bet big on HFC. They released all their related patents for
everyone to use some time ago (2015).
