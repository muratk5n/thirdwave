# Ammonia

How do we transport hydrogen? Usually pressurized tanks are used as a
solution. For a cheaper alternative researchers are looking at
"hydrogen carriers", substances which contain H2, but can be carried
efficiently.

Among these products ammonia stands out. Ammonia is advantageous in
transportation and storage because it has large hydrogen content per
unit volume, and is easily liquefiable (8.46 atm at 20Â°C). So existing
liquid transportation methods can carry it. The formula is for ammonia
NH3, hydrogen H2. Two H's as we see are in NH3.

There is already a huge infrastructure for producing ammonia. It is
produced about 150 million tons per year. Ammonia is used in cleaning
products, known for its sharp smell and ability to clean any kind of
grease. In movies, if dude passed out, someone brings a cloth to his
nose, he smell it, and wakes right the f--k up. That's ammonia.

Clean production methods: Folks at George Washington University came
up with an approach that uses air and water as a source of H2 . Air is
made up of 78% N2 . In their process the bubble of wet air is passed
through a mixture of tiny particles of iron oxide and molten NaOH and
KOH. When electricity is applied H2 is extracted from water and allows
H2O and air to interact directly to form NH3.

How to use ammonia as fuel: either convert it to hydrogen as needed
and use H2 fuel cells for power. Some are also looking at ammonia fuel
cells to use NH3 directly in the FC. No carbon emissions in either
case.

Exciting possibilities.
