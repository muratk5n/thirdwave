# Movement for a People's Party

2/3 Americans want a third party. It sounded almost unbelievable, Gallup confirms (6/10, still huge).Â 

Another crazy number: half the Democrats want a third party.

Why is Bernie not doing this? Why wait..? We have to admit though one reason Bernie could popularize his message was because he was part of the Dem 2016 primary. That was huge visibility, a huge stage from which to spread his message. The question now is when (or if) to bolt. I don't know... But it probably doesn't hurt to start the machinations for an option today, like MPP is apparently doing.

Good point: The Whigs collapsed due to divisions over slavery and gave rise to today's Republicans. Sometimes you can change a place, sometimes .. you can't. It's a pity the party of FDR cannot house progressives of today, but it could just be Democrats have no more change energy left in them. The fucking centrists, third-way Holywood glitz monkeys may have truly wrecked the place.

Yes, the superdelegate vote is a move in the right direction but then, I saw this.
