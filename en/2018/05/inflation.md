# Inflation

Unless the government is not literally printing money and handing out
directly to people (which has happened in some countries) inflation is
almost always highly correlated with wages. People need to have more
than they have so they spend more, so prices increase.

Wages come from employers, businesses. Businesses work on credit, and
credit is always newly printed money. Therefore when businesses hand
out salaries they are handing out that new money. That could result in
inflation, if there is too much credit out there, then the economy
"stars to heat up" i.e. inflation.

Note that bank credit does not come from bank customers' savings, they
are printed money, so money base expands. The system works because
even though the money base grows (through credit), the economy *grows
into that* base (credit was used to invest, hire ppl etc); more
products, services are circulating, but more money does not chase
after the same amount of goods, it chases after more amt of goods - no
inflation.

Bank credit is "printed money", brought into existence out of thin
air.. Just type bunch of numbers on a computer, boom. New money. There
is good reason for creating money and not simply lending out savings;
If only savings were lent out, growth + same money base = deflation.

Are government deficits inflationary? If new, more money reaches
citizens directly then it could be... If new money goes to
corporations, then no. [Research](https://anpec.org.br/revista/vol12/vol12n2p215_237.pdf)
on this area found a lagged response in inflation for government spending
where it existed. The true determinant seemed to be unit labor costs.
