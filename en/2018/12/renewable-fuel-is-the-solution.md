# Renewable Fuels are the Solution

The world reached its current predicament due to the use of [bad]
technology. Between 1751-2014 tons of carbon was emitted into the
atmosphere, and the causation between that and the global warming is
[clear to see](../../2021/07/historical-carbon-emissions.md). 70%
of the offenders were US, China, Russia, UK, Japan, Germany, France,
Canada. 

What to do about it? Without sacrificing the current modern wway of
life, there are but a few options. If our cars do not run on fossil
fuels, what do they run on? Lithium based batteries cannot be a
solution, world lithium reserves are [limited](../../2020/07/h2-numbers.md).
The only element that can serve as storage, as fuel (produced in one place,
and can be shipped elsewhere) is hydrogen based fuels. H2 can be stored
in many forms, gas, liquid, in ammonia, even through various catalytic
mechanisms in metallic form.

Saudi Arabia already made its first shipment as ammonia to Japan.
Italy has successfully tested existing NG pipelines to be used as H2
carriers; they will bring North African H2 gas produced cleanly into
Europe. Airbus is the process of converting their airplanes to use H2
fuels.

Right tech can save us. No other energy form has such diverse
applications that range from the big to the small. We need to apply
this to all parts in the chain, without wasting precious time.
