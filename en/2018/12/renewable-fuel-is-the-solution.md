# Renewable Fuels are the Solution

The world reached its current predicament due to the use of [bad]
technology. Between 1751-2014 tons of carbon was [emitted](../../2021/07/historical-carbon-emissions.md)
into the atmosphere, and the causation relation between that and the global
warming is [clear to see](../../2015/08/temp-increase.md#carbon).
70% of the carbon emitted during this 200+ year period was by US, China,
Russia, UK, Japan, Germany, France, and Canada.

What to do about it? Without sacrificing our current modern way of
life, there are but a few options. If our cars do not run on fossil
fuels, what do they run on? Lithium based batteries cannot be a
solution, world lithium reserves are [limited](../../2020/07/h2-numbers.md).
Carbon markets that allow one to trade, "offset" carbon are too open
for cheating. Need I mention the biggest emission scandal of all time
had a well-known automaker, Volkswagen as its offender, where they
tried to fool carbon emission detection. The best way to stop
cheating is not to give automakers any chance to cheat.

We can fix this problem at the source. If we effectively control,
regulate the production of a green fuel, all the way down the chain
the energy use will be clean. The only element that can serve as green
storage, green fuel (produced in one place, and can be shipped
elsewhere) is hydrogen. H2 can be [stored](../../2020/10/h2-storage.md) in many
medium; gas, liquid, in ammonia, even through various catalytic
mechanisms in metallic form.

Saudi Arabia already made its first shipment as ammonia to Japan.
Italy has successfully tested existing NG pipelines to be used as H2
carriers; they will bring North African H2 gas produced cleanly into
Europe. Airbus is the process of converting their airplanes to use H2
fuels. Right tech can save us. No other energy form has such diverse
applications, that range from the big to the small. There will be
total cost of ownership (TCO) benefits for using the right tech
widely, in all parts of the chain. We need to do this without wasting
precious time.
