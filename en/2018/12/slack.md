Slack [shuts
down](https://mobile.twitter.com/nick_brana/status/1076130399116505088)
a movement for Rep/Dem alternative -
[MPP](https://www.forapeoplesparty.org).

Washington Consensus is in overdrive. Shutdowns are all over the

These events again underline the need for truly decentralized
messaging platforms, and of course, decentralized payments.
