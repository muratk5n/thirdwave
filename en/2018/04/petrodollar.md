Good info.. especially in the first-half of the video. A little too
alarmist about wars, both sides are careful not to fight eachother
directly, also recently 200 Russian soldiers (mercenaries) tried to
attack a US base they got asses kicked good - afterwards, nothing
happened. But anyway; some heinous things were done for the
petrodollar, I agree 100%.
