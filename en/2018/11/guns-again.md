# Guns Again

The former US marine Ian Long entered a country and western bar in Thousand Oaks on Wednesday night and killed 12 people, including a sheriff’s deputy. More than two dozen were wounded [..].

Susan Orfanos, whose 27-year-old son, Telemachus Orfanos, a navy veteran, died on Wednesday night  [said] "I want those bastards in Congress … They need to pass gun control so no one else has a child that doesn’t come home,” she said, raising her voice to speak through gritted teeth and tears outside her home in the California suburb 40 miles north-west of Los Angeles.

Ironically non-presence of stricter gun laws is the fault of the Democrats.

When they chose to change focus from economic issues to soft-social ones, they pushed Republicans to become more radical on issues that previously could be agreed upon. Reagan was pro-gun control.  Nixon founded the EPA. Now both these issues are a no-man's-land for Republicans. Why? Why is sexual, abstinence, and other taboo-ish topics come to forefront in US politics whose political discourse has been exemplary for decades, starting with its founding. The new landscape is one where politicians like Rick "Scrotum" can get up and say "if you allow gay marriage, you're gonna marry your dog one day". There is no shortage of extremism on stupid issues. 100% agreement on primary economic issues.

So before blaming this, that or any other thing, centrist Democrats need to see the blood is on your hands.
