The Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) announced on
Sunday the launch of the country's first electric vehicle powered by
solid hydrogen fuel emitted from Nanopowders.

This came in a press release, after a visit of KISR Director General,
Samira Al-Sayed Omar to the program of nanotechnology and advanced
materials at the Institute, where she looked at the prototype of the
electric vehicle powered by hydrogen fuel.

The program was led by Osama Al-Sayegh, Executive Director of the
Institute's Energy and Construction Research Center, as saying that
the Center's Nanotechnology and Advanced Materials Program has
successfully launched the experimental prototype of an electric
vehicle powered by solid hydrogen fuel emitted from Nanopowders.

"These powders were prepared by the Center's compound for chemically
induced magnesium hydride adsorption by ultra-smooth granules of the
glass alloy (ZrNiPd)," Al-Sayegh added.
