Storyline preference becomes clear around the issue of identity. They
usually portray AI as a unique, non-copyable thing... When it is
sent somewhere it ceases to exist at the source. Why? That's not how
software works!

---

The reason AI come alive story is used more in movies these days is
not bcz Holywood necessarily knows what the phuck is going on on the
tech side.. They are basically repurposing the Pinoccio story for a
new domain. The "inanimate object coming alive" angle.. that's
all. Pinoccio for the good side, Frankenstein for the bad. Old story
adapted to something new, wout any change in semantics.

NYT: "Other People‚Äôs Rotten Jobs Are Bad for Them. And for You.. When
truck drivers are underpaid and overworked, it‚Äôs bad for them and also
bad for us.Researchers have found interesting connections between poor
working conditions and seemingly unrelated social problems. For
example, most people don‚Äôt think of the opioids crisis as a
labor-related issue, but research has shown a connection between
occupations with high workplace injury rates, like construction, and
opioid overdose fatalities. (People get injured on the job; lacking
sick days, they take opioids so they can work through the pain.)"

CCS isn't only about pulling carbon from the atmosphere. It can be
applied to any fossil product during refinery, before anything leaves
the plant.

---

What is the underlying technological assumption though? If you burn
fossil like today, sure its bad. But convert to renewable fuel at the
source through ccs, not so bad. Tech assumptions cannot solely be
based on pedestrian views of office-dwelling, white-collar,
have-an-app-for-that limpdick-electric crowd.

Texas is clamping down, right across the border, Mexico is easing
up. If women are denied service, they'll go right across the border to
get abortion. It's stupid to insist on this for TX, but the aim is not
politics, it is about secondary issues being made faux-primary issues
to fight faux-politics through culture war. So in a way it is smart,
in a 90s, Clinton-era kinda way.

I mean this speaks to the capability of said "AI" of which there is
not much.  You can lure these things into traps with rattle drums
probably.. How bleeping dumb are they? Libcucks swoon of course at the
first sight of a bright shiny object.. These are the innovators you
deserve

Yeah that shit works brilliantly lets be scared of it.

The beef with the oppo towards left parties, e.g. Die Linke isn't
based one issue or another. It is the general stance towards
them.. They say 'see these people over there, they are *beyond the
pale*', like, not even worth talking to. Pro-business FDP can argue
for cutting taxes in the middle of a crisis, but left cannot talk
about two-tier system in healthcare. That makes you some kind of
weirdo..

---

Wait until hospitals start denying covid patients.. Can happen right?
There are other emergencies, resources are limited, and there is now a
covid vaccine. Guy doesn't take it, gets his ass sick and shows up to
ER asking oxygen to be piped into him... Other patients need
care. Triage is a bitch.

SPD looks to be in the lead in Germany.. Its leader Schulz made some
comments about a possible coalition with leftist party Die Linke. Of
course shitlib, libcuck, limpdicks piled on him, but I hope he follows
through.. If he does, they could be in a similar situation to US Dems,
w Biden and their left. Greens too

Good.. Doesnt matter how GN did, recall needs to fail. The alternative
is mob rule. Less direct democracy.

"May offset" is not good enough. Plus only BE from sugar cane is
"carbon neutral". How can you make sure all production of this thing
is made that way? People will cheat. Remember how Volkswagen cheated.

EIA: "Producing and burning ethanol results in emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. However, the combustion of ethanol
made from biomass (such as corn and sugarcane) is considered
atmospheric carbon neutral because as the biomass grows, it absorbs
CO2, which may offset the CO2 produced when the ethanol is burned"
