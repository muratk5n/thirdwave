Texas is clamping down, right across the border, Mexico is easing
up. If women are denied service, they'll go right across the border to
get abortion. It's stupid to insist on this for TX, but the aim is not
politics, it is about secondary issues being made faux-primary issues
to fight faux-politics through culture war. So in a way it is smart,
in a 90s, Clinton-era kinda way.

DW: "Nord Stream 2: Last piece of gas pipeline is in place.. Engineers
have welded together the final piece of piping of the controversial
conduit, operators say. Gas supply to Germany is expected to begin in
October"

Turns out if there are no viewers left you cannot send them into a
tizzy with garbage takes to make money off them.


"Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Australia to Ease Climate Change
Denial.. The campaign, if sustained, could put pressure on Fox News,
though critics were skeptical that a sea change was in store."

I mean this speaks to the capability of said "AI" of which there is
not much.  You can lure these things into traps with rattle drums
probably.. How bleeping dumb are they? Libcucks swoon of course at the
first sight of a bright shiny object.. These are the innovators you
deserve

---

Yeah that shit works brilliantly lets be scared of it. 

"Facebook apology as AI labels black men 'primates'"

But the escape cld also have been helped by their deep state to make
the new guys look bad.. u never know

Its great

"A Palestinian militant leader and five other inmates staged an
elaborate escape from a high-security prison in Israel"

"'Population and Income Growth.. We do not see a simple
relationship. Many countries experienced both rapid population growth
and negative changes in real per capita GDP. But still others had
relatively rapid population growth, yet they had a rapid increase in
per capita GDP"

The beef with the oppo towards left parties, e.g. Die Linke isn't
based one issue or another. It is the general stance towards
them.. They say 'see these people over there, they are *beyond the
pale*', like, not even worth talking to. Pro-business FDP can argue
for cutting taxes in the middle of a crisis, but left cannot talk
about two-tier system in healthcare. That makes you some kind of
weirdo..

---

Wait until hospitals start denying covid patients.. Can happen right?
There are other emergencies, resources are limited, and there is now a
covid vaccine. Guy doesn't take it, gets his ass sick and shows up to
ER asking oxygen to be piped into him... Other patients need
care. Triage is a bitch.

SPD looks to be in the lead in Germany.. Its leader Schulz made some
comments about a possible coalition with leftist party Die Linke. Of
course shitlib, libcuck, limpdicks piled on him, but I hope he follows
through.. If he does, they could be in a similar situation to US Dems,
w Biden and their left. Greens too

Dems definitely wouldn't want that 10-past-10 square brother [either](https://youtu.be/IFqVNPwsLNo?t=1694).

Good.. Doesnt matter how GN did, recall needs to fail. The alternative
is mob rule. Less direct democracy.

"California Gov. Newsom and allies spent $36 million in August alone to
fight the recall"

New tech needs to be robust not just shiny.

"@PKovacs7

We have no internet, no power. The mail isn’t delivered. My Amazon
order was supposed to arrive 9/2 but I haven’t seen any of their
trucks. Yet an ancient device for conveying information, relying on
ink & paper, has been sitting on my driveway every morning since
Hurricane Ida"

"Caldor Fire continues to push north of Highway 50.. The Caldor Fire
was 37% contained as of Saturday morning, and crews were hopeful that
improving wind and weather conditions might help as they continue to
fight what is now California’s 15th largest wildfire. Over 680 homes
have been destroyed and 214,107 acres burned as of Saturday"

"May offset" is not good enough. Plus only BE from sugar cane is
"carbon neutral". How can you make sure all production of this thing
is made that way? People will cheat. Remember how Volkswagen cheated.

EIA: "Producing and burning ethanol results in emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. However, the combustion of ethanol
made from biomass (such as corn and sugarcane) is considered
atmospheric carbon neutral because as the biomass grows, it absorbs
CO2, which may offset the CO2 produced when the ethanol is burned"

The canisters have bioethanol in them

"Large blue boxes have been popping up across Nairobi in Kenya. They
look like cash machines, but ... dispense a clean cooking fuel [canister]"
