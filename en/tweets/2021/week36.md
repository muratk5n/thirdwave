We have no internet, no power. The mail isn’t delivered. My Amazon
order was supposed to arrive 9/2 but I haven’t seen any of their
trucks. Yet an ancient device for conveying information, relying on
ink & paper, has been sitting on my driveway every morning since
Hurricane Ida"

"May offset" is not good enough. Plus only BE from sugar cane is
"carbon neutral". How can you make sure all production of this thing
is made that way? People will cheat. Remember how Volkswagen cheated.

EIA: "Producing and burning ethanol results in emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. However, the combustion of ethanol
made from biomass (such as corn and sugarcane) is considered
atmospheric carbon neutral because as the biomass grows, it absorbs
CO2, which may offset the CO2 produced when the ethanol is burned"

"Large blue boxes have been popping up across Nairobi in Kenya. They
look like cash machines, but ... dispense a clean cooking fuel [canister]"
