"@gabriel_zucman

Post Trump tax reform, the United States collects less corporate
income tax revenue (as a fraction of GDP) than all other OECD
countries. Even Hungary, with its 9% tax rate, does better than the
US...

This matters because, fundamentally, the corporate tax is a minimum
tax for the very rich. Bezos, Buffett, Zuckerberg, etc can avoid the
individual income tax by asking their companies not to pay
dividends. But they still have to pay the corporate tax

Except now it's almost gone"

CJR: "As discussions on how to help save local news continue, new
bills and ideas have come to the fore. Independent newspapers are
coalescing around the Local Journalism Sustainability Act which
proposes direct subsidies (in the form of tax credits) for news
subscribers, local journalists and small business advertisers. Sweden
has a similar news subsidy system.

Large media outlets are backing the Journalism Competition and
Preservation Act which will allow outlets to band together to
negotiate with Google and Facebook. In some ways this is like
Australia‚Äôs recent News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory
Bargaining Code"

retaliated by setting out to destroy Donziger‚Äôs life. Now in his
twentieth month of house arrest on the orders of a Chevron-linked

GDELT uses news web pages as raw source, applies natural lang
processing algos on them to extract Actor1-Action-Actor2 type "events"

going back go March 1st; did not find any initial Ukraine
movement. The first time any build-up is reported in the region, in

parsed by GDELT is [here](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/top-us-general-calls-russia-ukraine-amid-reported-moscow-troop-buildup/).

Beckley: "Historically, when fast-growing great powers slow down, they
do not mellow out. Instead, they become more repressive at home and
aggressive abroad. They crack down on domestic dissent and expand
overseas to find new sources of wealth, rally citizens around the

problems. China is already on this path‚Äîas its growth slows, it is
repressing freedom in the mainland and in Hong Kong, ramping up
pressure on Taiwan, colonizing the South China Sea, building the
largest navy in the world, and buying assets and building ports all
