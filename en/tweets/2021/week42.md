Heat pumps are better than purely electrical (resistance) heating as
they use some gas inside, also clean, but will still cause an uptick
in electricity usage.. Depending on the price of electricity in a
country that can hurt budgets. Everything about electricity, from its
delivery, to its storage, is problematic. If renewable gas is piped
into homes it can simply upgrade gas boilers to use the new gas,
instead of natgas.

The tools, the science of this domain is nowhere near being effective,
undeserving of the AI moniker (they are "preliminary weak AI" at
best), and they will not get better using the current methods being
deployed today.

hate speech and violence, but the technology doesn't really work,

Sounds like defunding the poh-lice

"[Berkeley] city council passed 'BerkDOT,' a first-in-the-nation
measure to shift traffic enforcement to unarmed Department of
Transportation workers. In the summer of 2020, cities across America
made similar commitments: to curtail the use of force, shrink police
budgets, and fund fleets of civilian officers. But Berkeley was the
first to target the traffic cop. By doing so, it is rethinking police
power at its root. Traffic stops are by far the most common reason
that police officers initiate contact with members of the public; they
account for 84 percent of encounters, according to data from the
Bureau of Justice Statistics. In fact, before cars, ordinary citizens
rarely came in contact with law enforcement. As we rebuilt cities
around the automobile, historians contend, drivers came to expect to
be policed. And communities of color have paid the highest price"

Holywood is obsessed with Batman.. There is an unending stream of
movies made abt the character.. They couldn't even wait for the dust
settle on the last actor (B. Affl), they immediately served a new
actor (the vampire guy).

I suspect propaganda. B. Wayne is rich (BAff version even said as much
in one movie when asked about his powers, answering with "I'm
rich"). BM in the comics is supposed to be an innovator himself, a
detective, but in recent incarnations his toys, BW glamor are more
front and center. The message is this; government is failing (in fact
it always fails, it can't not fail), trust the billionaire to solve
problems for you.

Umpteenth Batman movie?

Yeaa but water isn't compressing there, really.. molecules are just
sort of moving out of the way to let the fork through, that is what's
going on

"But I can put a fork in water! Easy!"

---

It's true. A tree trunk, which is solid, can be compressed to smaller
size. But water cannot. It is counter-intuitive at first, but actually
makes sense if one thinks about it.

---

That I could believe.. Anyone studying fluids wld understand. Incompressibility 

"It is well known that underwater explosion cause more damage than the
same amount of explosive detonated in the air"

18 tons teq in the sea caused 3.9. But 1000 tons on land caused 3.3?

Interesting.. Lebanon 2020 explosion registered as 3.3 magnitude
earthquake, it was estimated to be 1 kilotons of TNT equivalent.

"The capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200,000
GWh, which meets the requirements for several months. In comparison,
the capacity of all the German pumped storage power plants only
amounts to about 40 GWh"

[[-]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301254520_Underground_and_pipeline_hydrogen_storage)

---

The pipeline system itself can be considered as storage; Even when we
are not pumping in new H2, the pipes themselves still have gas in
them. Same is true for natgas.

The presence of such massive supply at the consumer's doorstep can
spur development of more end-use products; eg carmakers they will
speed up FCEV production, we'll probably see more products around
portable canisters, etc. Supply is key. Aplenty will attract aplenty.

---

H2 transition can be in stages; Gov can first encourage production,
and distribution of H2 to cities via pipelines. If homes do not have
CHP, gas heating units, then gas is converted to electricity at a
local hub, the last mile remains the same. Later as people convert
their units at home, they can get the gas directly from city pipeline.

* Evergrande: Oct. 11 coupon not received 
* Xinyuan: will pay just 5% of Oct. 15 note

Most of those ew-money-printing-bad-so-bad-poop-fiat-gold-gold-gold
crowd u see in "certain media" are serving the interests of an
anti-dollar lobby, non-leading powers jealous their currency is not
the main one. Printing per-se isn't bad, the issue is who you print it
*for*. There is always printing. Plus developed countries aren't
foolish enough to end up like bleeping Venezuella. Then if there is
inflation, we can suspect wage increases, or supply issues, or both.

---

It happens to be one of the core tenets of econ.. time to hit the books?

Cld also be supply issues of course

"You said wage rises causes inflation.. I dont understand"

NYT: "[Senator Manchin], the Democrat from coal-rich West Virginia
whose vote is crucial to passage of the bill, has told the White House
that he strongly opposes the clean electricity program... As a result,
White House staffers are now rewriting the legislation without that
climate provision, and are trying to cobble together a mix of other
policies that could also cut emissions"

---

Malt is good.. I started seeing power bars with it, some exclusively
marketed to contain malt. There is dark malt powder for bread makers.
It cld go well in protein shakes too Im guessing.

Beans alone do not supply the 9 essential aminos, but rice and beans
do (no wonder the combo is a staple in some cuisines). Rice and peas
too..

---

These news cld be interpreted it either way. If RU ever wanted to turn on
CH, they now gained valuable intelligence about them, learned their
weapons, sub tactics.

"[Oct] Chinese, Russian navies conduct co-ordinated anti-submarine drill in Sea of Japan"

"[August RU/CH] drills also marked the first time Russian soldiers had used Chinese weapons"

A regular 48-inch hydrogen pipeline [can carry](https://gasforclimate2050.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020_European-Hydrogen-Backbone_Report.pdf)
13 Gigawatts. Little back-of-the envolope calculation; One person in the
developed world consumes 10 KW, this means a *single* H2 pipeline
can supply energy to 1.3 million people. 

That is a city the size of Ottowa, Zurich, or Belgrade.

One can learn abt government while in military.. It's **a** branch of
government after all.. For example how do they handle purchasing? A
new equipment is needed, what are the channels to get it done? You are
given a rifle, a canteen, whatever, how is that tracked?  Maybe that
information can help you understand the post office, or FEMA, or name
it, any other government agency. Even as a grunt, we might dismiss it
being at the bottom of the hierarchy, but in many ways everything
revolves around the grunt, his ass needs to be carried to and from the
"theather of action", provided food for, resting env, the grunt will
experience all that, first hand. I'd call that relevant experience.

"Why do you say military service is useful experience for politicians?"
