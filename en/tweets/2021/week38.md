This is the downside of polluting the thoughtsphere with artificial
noise; people have to twist, turn, become pretzel-like to offer
reasoning on simplest things, while people die.

"@RadioFreeTom

Breitbart is running a piece that says - I am not kidding - that the
left is mocking the unvaxed so they'll dig in and never get vaxed and
die and shift political power to the left"

Al Jazeera: "It is time Israel, the West admit the two-state solution is dead"

Bitcoin could have benefited from the "steroidified" attention
liberterians get in the thought-sphere as well.. Bright shiny object
tech will always have libtards to cheer for them, but BTC benefited
more from the former group.

---

The mystique is mostly for marketing. The tech is kludgy, not fit to
be a currency in the way its maximalists dream about. Glad it was
created, but have to move on. The gold-replacement angle definitely is
a no-go as gold itself could not serve that function.

---

"But he wasn't Satoshi, he was Satoshi's friend". Sure. Like "I have a
friend who does not think that's true". I am not saying it.. My friend says it.

---

The face looks too generic. I have a [picture of Satoshi](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_szmPgXIAMHAF8?format=jpg&name=small),
you could have used that.

Sucks to do politics in Russia

NYT: "[RU] new mansions are encroaching on the lakeshore, despite its
status as a national park... Ms. Makarova insisted that she was no
revolutionary and simply wanted everyone to follow the law. The bigger
issue, she said, was that most Russians fear getting involved in
politics because of the country’s bloody history. As a result, she
said, people with access to the levers of power easily take advantage
of those who don’t. 'Because of these huge cataclysms that happened to
their families, people realized that nothing depends on them, on
little people,' Ms. Makarova said. 'You will survive if you do not
interfere.'"

It's legit legislation-fu IMO. As long as shit doesn't hit the fan.

The Daily Beast: "Schumer surely concluded that some of his fellow
Democrats are hesitant to vote for a debt limit increase—and he did
not want to risk their opposition bringing down the entire must-pass
reconciliation bill. Moving the debt limit to regular legislation with
a 60-vote threshold allows Schumer to deflect attention from his own
party’s hesitancy, and instead blame Republican senators for not
bailing his party out"

I could tell, when Oz PM had a good welcome in Paris with Macron,
there was some kind of deal.. Vigourous handshake, not like that time
when Trump was handcucked, but "business is good", "hey mate", kinda
way.. The deal was probably on then. Later it is abruptly
canceled. FR, pissed.

Commotion? Hoo-ha..? Hurly burly?

Before he dies a decorated WWII German tank commander says "Valhalla
here I come".  That's the Nazi heaven isn't it? They are from
Atlantis, they go to Valhalla?

Mobilizing the other side was easy. The fall of the Berlin Wall scared
the shit ouf Dems anyway, they moved to center, low income folk were
out, office-dwelling shitlibs were in. Dangle little Kennedy-cool in
front of them, pick and choose from the movements of 60s, done. The
new crowd could "get red in the face" when Vietnam was mentioned, and
celebrate the bombing of Libya.

---

Libertarians unknowingly could have provided the much-needed
ideological support for the Rep/Dem culture war, so that the
single-party, Washington Consensus could continue unimpeeded..

Conservatives could likely compromise on gun control (see Ronald
Reagan) or for climate protection (see Richard Nixon) but the
single-party rule needed the "secondary" issues to be radicalized. To
that end Reps could always point to a libertarian to justify these
extreme positions, 'look these guys over there are against it, gun
control is too much government, climate protection is, well, too much
government, and they are quoting some 18 century jagoff, so they must
have a point"..

Libertarians are the useful idiots in this picture bcz they would
never get their zero-deficit no-war wishes from the single-party,
instead they became tools to blunt the visible stupidity of the
culture war, providing the much needed ideological paintjob.
