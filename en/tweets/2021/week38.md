# Week 38

Europeans send their trash to Poland and companies there just burn it..?

APNews: "(2018) Poland‚Äôs prime minister vowed tough measures Tuesday
to fight a string of illegal fires at garbage dumps and landfills that
has been producing hazardous smoke..

TV stations in Poland have been showing footage of huge clouds of
smoke billowing into the air from various dump sites, as firefighters
try to contain the situation"

See how he talks about functions, data. "Coders" naturaly understand
this slant on AI albeit weak, bcz they know how to "run stuff",
functions (software has them too), so they can intuit the
approach. This view is one level above complete ignorance. The next
one requires compsci grok.

Could be GA.. The BTC code was officially turned over to his upkeep,
the last email sent from SN was to GA. His psych profile suggests an
overdeveloped sense of justice, seeing a lot of people wronged by the
finance system could push a person like that to act. Theres leadership
ability; being able to entice people to work in orgs, etc -- crucial
for an open-source project. Background suggests he would have more
knowledge than others (in that BTC group) on projects crafted for the
industry, he co-wrote the VRML standard so would know how to present
stuff for pro developer consumption.

There are other Satoshi N possibilities of course.. According to
[this](2021/09/satoshi-identification.md) analysis, Gavin Andresen is
the closest to SN, based on word frequency usage.

Bolsonaro almost sounded like a sane leader in that speech.

If "they" wanted to get you, "sterilize you through covid
vaccinations", I dont think they'd wait until a worldwide crisis, and
a brand new vaccination campaign. They could do it through food, soft
drinks like Coca Cola, or measles vaccines which most kids already
get. They'd just slip it in there, and noone would ever know.. if it
were that easy.

Aha, the French deal was not nuke based, but diesel..? That matters a
lot, especially against CH. Then the switch makes more sense, even the
"at all costs" way it was done. The diplom could've been handled
better perhaps..

NPR: "The Australian Navy's six Collins-class submarines are set to
reach the end of their service life in 2036. And in 2016, France was
chosen over Germany and Japan to help Australia replace its older subs
with 12 new diesel-electric submarines"

This is the downside of polluting the thoughtsphere with artificial
noise; people have to twist, turn, become pretzel-like to offer
reasoning on simplest things, while people die.

Bitcoin could have benefited from the "steroidified" attention
liberterians get in the thought-sphere as well.. Bright shiny object
tech will always have libtards to cheer for them, but BTC benefited
more from the former group.

---

The mystique is mostly for marketing. The tech is kludgy, not fit to
be a currency in the way its maximalists dream about. Glad it was
created, but have to move on. The gold-replacement angle definitely is
a no-go as gold itself could not serve that function.

"But he wasn't Satoshi, he was Satoshi's friend". Sure. Like "I have a
friend who does not think that's true". I am not saying it.. My friend says it.

you could have used that.

Sucks to do politics in Russia

NYT: "[RU] new mansions are encroaching on the lakeshore, despite its
status as a national park... Ms. Makarova insisted that she was no
revolutionary and simply wanted everyone to follow the law. The bigger
issue, she said, was that most Russians fear getting involved in
politics because of the country‚Äôs bloody history. As a result, she
said, people with access to the levers of power easily take advantage
of those who don‚Äôt. 'Because of these huge cataclysms that happened to
their families, people realized that nothing depends on them, on
little people,' Ms. Makarova said. 'You will survive if you do not
interfere.'"

It's legit legislation-fu IMO. As long as shit doesn't hit the fan.

The Daily Beast: "Schumer surely concluded that some of his fellow
Democrats are hesitant to vote for a debt limit increase‚Äîand he did
not want to risk their opposition bringing down the entire must-pass
reconciliation bill. Moving the debt limit to regular legislation with
a 60-vote threshold allows Schumer to deflect attention from his own
party‚Äôs hesitancy, and instead blame Republican senators for not
bailing his party out"

I could tell, when Oz PM had a good welcome in Paris with Macron,
there was some kind of deal.. Vigourous handshake, not like that time
when Trump was handcucked, but "business is good", "hey mate", kinda
way.. The deal was probably on then. Later it is abruptly
canceled. FR, pissed.

Mobilizing the other side was easy. The fall of the Berlin Wall scared
the shit ouf Dems anyway, they moved to center, low income folk were
out, office-dwelling shitlibs were in. Dangle little Kennedy-cool in
front of them, pick and choose from the movements of 60s, done. The
new crowd could "get red in the face" when Vietnam was mentioned, and
celebrate the bombing of Libya.

Libertarians unknowingly could have provided the much-needed
ideological support for the Rep/Dem culture war, so that the
single-party, Washington Consensus could continue unimpeeded..

Conservatives could likely compromise on gun control (see Ronald
Reagan) or for climate protection (see Richard Nixon) but the
single-party rule needed the "secondary" issues to be radicalized. To
that end Reps could always point to a libertarian to justify these
extreme positions, 'look these guys over there are against it, gun
control is too much government, climate protection is, well, too much
government, and they are quoting some 18 century jagoff, so they must
have a point"..

Libertarians are the useful idiots in this picture bcz they would
never get their zero-deficit no-war wishes from the single-party,
instead they became tools to blunt the visible stupidity of the
culture war, providing the much needed ideological paintjob.
