Sad. Prof is saying all her grad students these days are just tuning
parameters on some neural net like a monkey. We can take comfort in
the fact these ppl wont bring about AGI dystopia. One less item to
worry about.

*Finch* is supposed to take place in 2030 -- 9 years away.. And the
roboticist guy had strong AI tech? Sci wouldn't have advanced that
far.. not with the current neural, "deep" approaches. He'd have the
dog and some bizarre chatbot that spits out random facts from
Encyclopedia Brittanica. I'd rather have all published novels be read
aloud to me through Text-to-Speech, or have re-runs of MASH.

WB/Munger joint interviews are hilarious. Munger keeps calling other
approaches "twaddle".

---

Buy/hold is not always boring. Can still do "quickies", bcz you know
something others dont, the company is good.. Falls will be accompanied
by rises, there'll be return to trend.

---

But these days ironically Berksh has a lot of cash in hand; cant find
good companies to invest in or cant find any good company that is not
overvalued? 🤔  Probably the latter. Wilshire Index is through the roof.

---

So Buffett / Munger approach is not timing the market, buy stock if
value looks good. 60/40, 70/30 doesnt matter (as in stocks/bonds),
it's all about companies. Diversification doesn't matter which in
their method is a sign of ignorance. There is no "cash position", u
end up with it if cant find a good company to invest in, it is not an
investment vehicle.

But imo the ideology, its first inception, quickly [fell out of
favor](../../2020/04/turks-culture-national-narrative.md#estagfurullah),
stayed that way until well into the 20th century when Kemal and his
cohorts utilized, resurrected the same escapist fantasy to handle a
similar trauma. The empire was gone, and the new nation needed
something "different". The founders served up the nomadic Turk from
faraway lands, just like Nazis had dreamt up the Aryan from Atlantis.

---

The claim is the Otto itself started the Turkist ideology partially in
the 15th century, before the "Grand Ancestor" Kemal. Otto had its ass
kicked back then by Temarlane from Central Asia, so historians
(propagandists) were attempting to say "yeah we are kinda like that
guy, we are from that region too".

Energy *can* become a non-issue. Absolutely. Yes we can.

H2 View: "Hydrogen has always been the answer to our energy
needs. However, the configuration of global politics post WW1, which
was won by oil and coal supremacy, was always going to be a tough nut
to crack...

With hydrogen, we can now take energy “off the table” as a source of
so many historic ills, and we can do it far more rapidly than has been
suggested"

---

H2 View: "Australia has started trials for a hydrogen *Guarantee of
Origin* scheme that aims to add value for all types of hydrogen with
specification on how the hydrogen was sourced to allow customers to
know how clean it is"

---

H2 View: "Australia has seen significant progress within its hydrogen
sector and has now been recognised as a ‘world leader’ in hydrogen
technologies in the State of Hydrogen report...

This expansion of the hydrogen sector will continue to expand with the
Government launching significant funding opportunities for the sector
[as seen in] the $464m Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hubs programme that
has already seen benefits with hubs being announced across the nation"

Never Tango with an Eskimo. That was a song.

---

I see.. Iglos have good insulation, the rest is body heat. They are
not the problem.

---

How do the Eskimo get heating..?

---

Yep. Confirms an earlier obs, this fact jumps out at you looking at
the emission graph. Heating is the worst polluter, first bcz of its
energy requirements (which are not 100% green) and through unorthodox
methods of generating heat IMO in the developing world.. I cant blame
them, the alternative wld be freezing to death.

US EPA: "Recent data suggest that space heating accounts for about 42
percent of energy use in U.S. residences and about 36 percent of
energy use in U.S. commercial buildings"
