Hypersonics are not a panacea.. Every capability invites its defense,
for HS case, now the other side will consider attacking missile
launches at a mere hint of a launch, at its source. Then you're kind of
back to square one; trying to defend the homeland, makes attack on
the homeland more likely.

I describe such people as sophisticated tourists.. knowing more abt
a country than many others, but not *of* them.

Culturally Dr Oz is straight-up American (he grew up in US), wout an
iota of tigger in him. Immigrant parents cannot shape the cultural
make-up of a child, nor vacation visits to the "homeland". "It takes a
village" is correct in more ways than one. The village has your child,
not you

Toto did the score for *Dune* 1984?

In my system there is extreme flipping (while flipping the bird to
teachers), and no grades, but at the very least schools should flip
the classroom as it's generally described.

"In fact, in one study, 200 teachers flipped their classrooms, and 85%
of them saw an overall increase in grades"

Heard of this DSP guy, he used 4th order poly approx for a signal proc
approach, and it worked *better* than using the periodic function
itself 😶

---

Working on a new time series structural break test approach..
Need to remove trend, and peridocity

---

Why fourth order? Has to do with the Taylor expansion probably..

TE is supposed to mirror derivatives of the approximated func, and,
for $\sin$,

$\sin^{\prime}(x)=\cos(x),\quad$
$\sin^{\prime\prime}(x)=-\sin(x),\quad$,
$\sin^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)=-\cos(x),\quad$,
$\sin^{(4)}(x)=\sin(x)$.

The fourth order derivative came back to the sine function itself.

---

Approximating periodic functions with 4th degree polynomial works well.

I was wondering about that; if electrolysis could be bypassed
altogether, with the method below elec generation is not needed, plant
goes from the Sun to H2 fuel, direct. Great news. Fantastic research.

"Synlight: Researchers expect that within 10 years, Concentrated Solar
Power (CSP) can be used to split water to hydrogen chemically using
the world’s desert sun... light is concentrated on a demonstration
system containing a cerium oxide lattice. If steam is led into the
reaction chamber, the oxygen it contains will combine with the metal
at around 800 °C and will be absorbed by it, so that hydrogen is the
only product left. Hoffschmidt said that the gas was 'an alchemist’s
dream,' as 'this high-energy fuel can be used to create virtually
anything.'"

"Bloom energy used its electrolyzer powered by Heliogen’s CSP
technology for the green hydrogen fuel production. According to
Heliogen, its ..  CSP technology is capable of producing electricity
for longer spans of time than traditional solar photovoltaic (PV)
technology. By storing the solar energy, it can operate for just about
24 hours per day and seven days per week"

CSP generated H2 from Africa, or Australia through pipelines cld
supply the entire world with cheap energy.

Ukraine is short of coal supplies, Russia cut off its exports and
since invaded Donbass with coal mines, they are now controlled by
Russia. Plus there is an NG crunch pushing coal prices up.. Ukraine is
desperately trying to import from US, Latin America while winter is
approaching..

What a f-ing mess.

Replication of its duration histogram. It is exponential distribution.

Angola, Namibia, Tanzania.
