WOW. Berliners just decisively voted to expropriate ~240,000
apartments currently owned by “mega-landlords” (private real estate
companies/developers) and turn them into socialized public housing"

On a pickled veg exploration phase.. pickled garlic? Dam

The Blue Origin rocket that went to space used liquid H2 as
fuel. Good. But many others, even the next B Origin hardware plan to
use kerosene. Not clean. This stuff needs to be regulated, a ban on
fossil fuels for space?

BBC: "More people feeling forced into private healthcare.. they were
told [patient] would need urgent surgery - but that because of the
backlog caused by the pandemic, he would have to wait more than two
years"

We used to have CD players in our notebooks.. Holy pimp

Nazis (AFD) took a big chunk of your shit. The point of your party was
not to let that happen.

WSJ: "Covid-19 Vaccine Gap Between Rich and Poor Nations Keeps Widening"

Such tech could be used in negative ways, of course, but factory
automation has been killing people for centuries now. Any tool can
have adverse effects. A spoon could kill you. If you fall on it
certain way, it is standing pointing up, on the ground.. That's not
what the phuckers are talking about. Phuckers are all about strong AI,
singularity. That is the big delusion.

---

Cld say around topics which under weak AI category (speech recog,
computer vision -basic pattern recognition-) some milesones were
reached, sure.

---

In the last TV debate DE parties were already discussing how to form
coalition. No posturing, kinda good

When you are [hiring](../../2021/03/unrivaled-beckley.md#ed) from among the
best and brightest, you can let these ppl roam free. Most of the world
cannot replicate that. Then quality needs to be delivered in a
different way -- electronically.

"In Finland teachers decide how to teach the curriculum"

---

We need decouple learning from certificaton, introduce async concepts
at each level of ed. Learn from the best through prerecorded
[videos](../../2017/09/education-workplace.md), and ask to be certified at
your own pace, by expert certifiers.

DW: "India: Why medical students are taking their own lives.. Some
students who have taken the NEET medical entrance exam have killed
themselves, alarming authorities in the southern state of Tamil
Nadu. Entrants say the pressure is immense"

"[Oz businessman, former CEO of Fortescue Metals Group] Andrew Forrest
launched a green hydrogen [org], in a push to speed up development of
the clean fuel to help curb global warming"

"Buffalo mayor-to-be India Walton a ‘very proud’ democratic
socialist.. 'We will bail out Wall Street and banks and give a billion
dollars in tax incentives to one of the richest people in the world to
build an empty Tesla factory in South Buffalo, and when it comes to
providing the resources that working families need to thrive,
socialism becomes scary at that point. So, I’m very proud to be a
democratic socialist. I am proud to have the support of Buffalo DSA
and national DSA (Democratic Socialists of America)"

*Apache Junction*, a story on journalism really, albeit in a Wild West
context.. Watchable.

---

UCDP/PRIO conflict stats update. Fall in Mozambique, Afghanistan
(obviously).  Egypt is always up there.. the place is never settling
down. Somalia, Nigeria, in turmoil as before.  Increase of deaths in Pakistan,
Yemen. The latter looks pretty bad actually.

Reynolds Averaged equations? Yes.. invented by Osborne Reynolds. Irish
mfker -from Ireland-.

Where are our American friends? Center of research, noone stepping up?
Europe did its part. Euler, Navier, Stokes, Laplace gave you the
proper model (the [cat's cradle](../../2021/09/computing-ai.md)), but now
noone can work the model and get answers, centuries later? That SciAm
article has the Who Is Who of the field, they are all scratching their
heads.. F-ing McLean produces literature, but I've never in my life
read a book explaning what something isn't rather than what it is, in
its entirety.

---

We cant explain lift.. weird. The math model for aerodynamics is
known. Compsci can compute all flow around a wing using it, and can
show the pressure gradients. Today. That model could be interrogated
symbolically for certain patterns of shapes, mathematically.. Why
isn't this done?

Reminds me of [this](../../2013/12/cost-gravity.md) Hintjens commentary..

Politico: "President Joe Biden's decision to nominate Cornell law
professor Saule Omarova to regulate the nation's banks is triggering
intense anxiety among the lenders and their Washington lobbyists and
threatens to set off a bruising battle in Congress.

Omarova is more than just a finance industry critic — she has proposed
essentially ending the banking industry as we know it by letting the
Federal Reserve take on the deposit accounts of all Americans"
