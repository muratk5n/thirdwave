# Week 39

"@jasonhickel

On this day in 1967, the United States collaborated in a coup that
deposed Sukarno, the first leader of independent Indonesia, and
replaced him with a right-wing dictatorship. US officials conspired
with the dictatorship to massacre 500,000 left-wing [Indonesians]"

Some words get thrown around too easily. Superpower? This is a country
which has a long agrarian-empire past -a negative-, did not explore as
the West did, in fact, failed to map even the mid-size landmasses near
it, missed the boat on most major tech innovations of the last 300
years.. You dont come back from that e-z.

One addition here; CH is [not a rising superpower](../../2021/03/power-of-nations-beckley.md#chsuperpower).

Now we start to see the creation of a lowflation world was a policy
choice. Creditors were happy. Businesses were happy, they could get
depressed wages through outsourcing or immigration. Through
competition the single-party employer-state kept citizens on their
toes, didn't have to give them any benefits, in reverse, lack of
benefits helped them to import new citizens easier.

But there was trouble in paradise..  More and more money was chasing
freak investments.

The watchdog ICAC has some pull, eh? 

There doesnt seem to be an underhanded motive behind the
investigation, or premier failure at the job. She looked like an able
public servant.. Sad.

"[Oz state Premier] Gladys Berejiklian resigns as NSW premier as ICAC investigates"

---

The problem is also due to Reps not being in government. If they were,
the overall message cld differ, the public cld be led
differently.. Governance carries some responsibility, noone in gov
wants to be hemmed in to a corner by inane arguments. Trump was
actually keeping the culture war contained on less deadly dumb-ass
shit, like masks. The followers were being fed a culture war on that,
but not on vaccines. With that "guidance" gone, retards are running
around in random directions, "free-range", causing chaos.

No green tech comes close to renewable fuels' versatility. Between
green ammonia and green H2, they can handle all cases. Ammonia can
handle refigration. H2 can power rockets (see the latest Blue Origin
launch), even serve as a battery, see [Lavo](https://lavo.com.au/).

Dried beans are extremely energy inefficient. Rehydrating, cooking
them takes too much energy, and when hydrated they become too heavy
(with all that water).

"Certain products require longer cooking periods thus energy
consumption is higher. For example, cooking beans takes around eight
times longer and can require more than 200 MJ per kg food"

New PM's opponent was pro-renewables, we'll see how this guy turns

Lowflation is not a good place to be.. Investment starts going after
bizarre companies, debtors get in trouble, ppl dont have incentive to
spend.

Ew but young people, old people, etc.. How many ppl does it take to
invent a f-ing Walkman? You can get stuff done, with the same amt of

---

Abenomics tried and tried and failed to increase inflation. It should
not be too surprising, Japan's labor pool was decreasing. Inflation
requires workers who are earning salary and spending it. One choice
cld be giving existing ppl more money to spend - direct cash. Abe did
bunch of supply-side band-aid ("cutting red tape"), and failed.

Not bad.. 

BBC: "[Kishida] promised to spend billions of dollars to help the
world's third-biggest economy recover from Covid restrictions.

Unlike another rival .. he has been more critical of the economic
policy of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, known as Abenomics, saying
that only the rich got richer.

With China also high on the agenda for the leadership election, Mr
Kishida has accused Beijing of wanting to export 'its authoritarian
system'"

Such tech could be used in negative ways, of course, but factory
automation has been killing people for centuries now. Any tool can
have adverse effects. A spoon could kill you. If you fall on it
certain way, it is standing pointing up, on the ground.. That's not
what the phuckers are talking about. Phuckers are all about strong AI,
singularity. That is the big delusion.
