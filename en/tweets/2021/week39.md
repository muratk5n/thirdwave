Triage, rationing, how wonderful..

Palin's death panels are here probably not the way she expected them

\#ABCPlanetAmerica

"As the spread of the delta variant continues unabated in much of the
U.S., public health leaders have approved health care rationing in
Idaho and parts of Alaska and Montana... But determining who gets what
is no easy feat...

States may use a combination of factors to come up with patient
'priority scores.' Idaho‚Äôs and Montana‚Äôs system both consider how well
a patient‚Äôs major organ systems are functioning.

The final tie-breaker is a lottery system"

NYT: "[Russian parliamentary elections] Over the weekend, videos of
ballot stuffing and other apparent instances of fraud circulated
widely on social media... Apparently fearing a rebuke at the ballot
box, the authorities barred just about all well-known opposition
figures from running for Parliament, while forcing many dissidents
into exile and declaring popular independent media outlets to be
'foreign agents.'"

The Blue Origin rocket that went to space used liquid H2 as
fuel. Good. But many others, even the next B Origin hardware plan to
use kerosene. Not clean. This stuff needs to be regulated, a ban on
fossil fuels for space?

Such tech could be used in negative ways, of course, but factory
automation has been killing people for centuries now. Any tool can
have adverse effects. A spoon could kill you. If you fall on it
certain way, it is standing pointing up, on the ground.. That's not
what the phuckers are talking about. Phuckers are all about strong AI,
singularity. That is the big delusion.

When you are [hiring](../../2021/03/unrivaled-beckley.md#ed) from among the

different way -- electronically.

UCDP/PRIO conflict stats update. Fall in Mozambique, Afghanistan

Where are our American friends? Center of research, noone stepping up?
Europe did its part. Euler, Navier, Stokes, Laplace gave you the
proper model (the [cat's cradle](../../2021/09/computing-ai.md)), but now
noone can work the model and get answers, centuries later? That SciAm
article has the Who Is Who of the field, they are all scratching their
heads.. F-ing McLean produces literature, but I've never in my life
read a book explaning what something isn't rather than what it is, in
its entirety.

We cant explain lift.. weird. The math model for aerodynamics is
known. Compsci can compute all flow around a wing using it, and can
show the pressure gradients. Today. That model could be interrogated
symbolically for certain patterns of shapes, mathematically.. Why
isn't this done?

Politico: "President Joe Biden's decision to nominate Cornell law
professor Saule Omarova to regulate the nation's banks is triggering
intense anxiety among the lenders and their Washington lobbyists and
threatens to set off a bruising battle in Congress.

Omarova is more than just a finance industry critic ‚Äî she has proposed
essentially ending the banking industry as we know it by letting the
Federal Reserve take on the deposit accounts of all Americans"
