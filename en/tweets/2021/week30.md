# Week 30

I see some patches in gobble gobble that are fine..

Some parts in Georgia look good..

Elevation is key

NYT: "[Biden] made it clear that most of the 2,500 American troops
currently stationed in Iraq would remain, simply reclassified on paper
into advisory and training roles. The United States‚Äô role, he said,
would be ‚Äúto continue to train, to assist, to help, and to deal with
ISIS as it arrives.'..

But in the conflict in Iraq, another decades-old war that many view as
more costly than the one in Afghanistan, he sees an American presence
as necessary, at least in part, to ward off the influence of Iran and
the continuing threat of the Islamic State"

"@A_Andromeda_guy

Russia has got to have concerns about this sort of expenditure as they
have actually fought a war against China whereas the US has not, and
those missiles could just be easily aimed at Moscow during a border
dispute"

"[I]f you follow the [GR] equations back in time, general relativity
eventually stops working. Therefore, no one presently knows how the
universe began. Indeed, we may never know. Since the days of Einstein,
physicists have made much progress detailing the history of the
universe. But the deeper they try to peer into our past, the more
difficult their task becomes...

The miserable status of today‚Äôs theories for the early universe makes
me wonder whether it has already happened. Cosmologists have hundreds
of theories, and many of those theories come in several variants. It‚Äôs
not quite as bad as in particle physics, but the situation is similar
in that cosmologists, too, produce loads of ill-motivated models for
no reason other than that they can get them published. (And they
insist this is good scientific practice. Don‚Äôt get me started.)..

The currently most popular theory for the early universe is called ‚Äúinflation‚Äù...

Ever since the results of the Planck in 2013 it hasn‚Äôt looked good for inflation"

"@conorsen

The lesson of this crisis is all ‚Äústructural economic problems‚Äù are
actually structural political problems and largely policy

"Dark matter is an example of a research program that used to be
progressive but has become degenerative. In its original form, dark
matter was a simple parameterization that fit a lot of observations ‚Äì
a paradigmatic example of a good scientific hypothesis. However, as
David Merritt elucidates in his recent book 'A philosophical approach
to MOND', dark matter has trouble with more recent observations, and
physicists in the area have taken on to accommodating data, rather
than making successful predictions.

Moreover, the abundance of specific particle models for dark matter
that physicists have put forward are unnecessary to explain any
existing observations. These models produce publications but they do
not further progress. This isn‚Äôt so surprising because guessing a
specific particle from rather unspecific observations of its
gravitational pull has an infinitesimal chance of working.

Theories for the early universe or fifth forces suffer from a similar
problem. They do not explain any existing observations. Instead, they
make the existing ‚Äì very well working ‚Äì theories more complicated
without solving any problem"
