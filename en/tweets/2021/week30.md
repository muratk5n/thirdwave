The lesson of this crisis is all ‚Äústructural economic problems‚Äù are
actually structural political problems and largely policy
choices. Don‚Äôt listen to anyone who says inequality/lowflation are
some natural function of how the economy works today"

"Dark matter is an example of a research program that used to be
progressive but has become degenerative. In its original form, dark
matter was a simple parameterization that fit a lot of observations ‚Äì
a paradigmatic example of a good scientific hypothesis. However, as
David Merritt elucidates in his recent book 'A philosophical approach
to MOND', dark matter has trouble with more recent observations, and
physicists in the area have taken on to accommodating data, rather
than making successful predictions.

Moreover, the abundance of specific particle models for dark matter
that physicists have put forward are unnecessary to explain any
existing observations. These models produce publications but they do
not further progress. This isn‚Äôt so surprising because guessing a
specific particle from rather unspecific observations of its
gravitational pull has an infinitesimal chance of working.

Theories for the early universe or fifth forces suffer from a similar
problem. They do not explain any existing observations. Instead, they
make the existing ‚Äì very well working ‚Äì theories more complicated
without solving any problem"
