Not a big fan of these programs. IMO attacking the root with tech
(green molecules) will do more

"@fauxRayDalio

My bearish plays: BABA, JD and NIO. I don‚Äôt care what their growth or
revenue is. China‚Äôs Communist Ruling Party is a scam, untrustworthy,
and ultimately will pillage all profits from any company. American
investors will never see a dime. My bull position: India"

Its true

Vox: "Starbucks is sort of America‚Äôs bathroom. In cities like New
York, where public restrooms are hard to come by, it‚Äôs the de facto

Whats the deal? Tali wld only get rural and was supposed to keep out
of city centers?

"[I]f you follow the [GR] equations back in time, general relativity
eventually stops working. Therefore, no one presently knows how the
universe began. Indeed, we may never know. Since the days of Einstein,
physicists have made much progress detailing the history of the
universe. But the deeper they try to peer into our past, the more
difficult their task becomes...

The miserable status of today‚Äôs theories for the early universe makes
me wonder whether it has already happened. Cosmologists have hundreds
of theories, and many of those theories come in several variants. It‚Äôs
not quite as bad as in particle physics, but the situation is similar
in that cosmologists, too, produce loads of ill-motivated models for
no reason other than that they can get them published. (And they
insist this is good scientific practice. Don‚Äôt get me started.)..

The currently most popular theory for the early universe is called ‚Äúinflation‚Äù...

Ever since the results of the Planck in 2013 it hasn‚Äôt looked good for inflation"

Now he calls Bolsonaro "an agent of genocide".

At a time when covid was out of control, there was bunch of chaos,
Lula jumps in with 'Brasil has no government'. Right on the nose.

---

Lula F24 interview was great. The guy is an excellent communicator,
understands econ pretty well too..

"@conorsen

The lesson of this crisis is all ‚Äústructural economic problems‚Äù are
actually structural political problems and largely policy
choices. Don‚Äôt listen to anyone who says inequality/lowflation are
some natural function of how the economy works today"

Solopreneur? Interesting word.

"Dark matter is an example of a research program that used to be
progressive but has become degenerative. In its original form, dark
matter was a simple parameterization that fit a lot of observations ‚Äì
a paradigmatic example of a good scientific hypothesis. However, as
David Merritt elucidates in his recent book 'A philosophical approach
to MOND', dark matter has trouble with more recent observations, and
physicists in the area have taken on to accommodating data, rather
than making successful predictions.

Moreover, the abundance of specific particle models for dark matter
that physicists have put forward are unnecessary to explain any
existing observations. These models produce publications but they do
not further progress. This isn‚Äôt so surprising because guessing a
specific particle from rather unspecific observations of its
gravitational pull has an infinitesimal chance of working.

Theories for the early universe or fifth forces suffer from a similar
problem. They do not explain any existing observations. Instead, they
make the existing ‚Äì very well working ‚Äì theories more complicated
without solving any problem"

Nothing like a good random number generator... `os.urandom`.

It "allow[s] access to environmental noise collected from
device drivers and other sources".

See he dealth with FBI.. that's also experience :)

FBI had him as an informant to tell on his potentially communist
fellow actors. But he didn't do much snitching, from what I understand

Didnt see action at war but still, you are still in that machinery,
see how gov works.

The pimp thing is funny.. before MF played that role in *Street
Smart*, noone knew what a pimp was. Afterwards, everyone is like 'yeah
that's a pimp'.

---

It is true a lot of avenues are open to you in US, for any race, if
you put your mind to it. MF played so many roles.. A pimp, a
President, a prisoner, God..

Dam.. Morgan Freeman is taking no shit on race relations from anyone

Countries seem to be good on one thing or another.. meaning
containment strategies vs vaccinations.
