A good actor can make a good script phenomenal. That is true. 

---

"If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage". Good saying. A great
actor cannot save a bad script, or bad directing. Movies are mostly
about the story, the camera angles, when to cut etc.

Therefore what we see as successful actors are not just good actors,
but know how to pick scripts (and directors). They have an eye for
it. Otherwise they'd be toast.  Appear in wrong movies a few times you
are done bcz great work is not just about acting, but the overall
production.
