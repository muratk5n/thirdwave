"Consumer prices in [DE]¬†have been increasing for months, fueled by
rising energy and food prices as well as the withdrawal of a temporary
reduction in value-added tax (VAT), which was aimed at mitigating the
economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic last year by boosting
domestic consumption"

They need to include this 'energy' in hurricane reporting, as in how
much mass is moving when hurricane makes landfall. Kinetic energy is
$1/2 m v^2$, increase mass increase energy. Would one rather get hit
with baloon or a hammer at the same speed?

"Hurricane Katrina was a 'huge storm' with a 'very expansive' wind
field compared to an average storm.. Hurricane Ida strengthened
rapidly in the hours before it made landfall, whereas Katrina did the
opposite, strengthening to a Category 5 over the Gulf of
Mexico.. 'Hurricane Katrina.. was significantly larger, and had more
energy associated with it'"

[geek] Handling non-differentiability looks to be key.. both in
simulation and for optimization. To this day I cannot find a better TV
denoiser that will beat a subgradient based one. Discontinuous
galerkin methods now rule all sorts of domains in simulation. Just
came upon the Igel seismology book, he is also diggin the DG [/geek]

"As long as the Islamic terrorists remain in Idlib, [ISIS] in the east
and Iranians near the Israeli border, the Syrian civil war will not be
over... Iran wants to repeat in Syria what it has been doing in Yemen
for several years. In Yemen Iran perfected an effective way to attack
Saudi Arabia by arming Shia rebels in Yemen with over a thousand
ballistic missiles and UAVs... Iran is seeking to carry out a similar
campaign against Israel using Iran backed militias in Syria"

Lectures can be viewed at school just as easily as they are viewed at
home. The key is content, and who delivers it.

---

If they want better education, they should ask for prerecorded lecture
videos of the experts to teach their children rather than a
parrot/doofus wildly gestulating (teacher)

---

"Children going to school" isn't preferred bcz it is better for their
education. Parents need it because in a modern setting, school
functions as a day-care center, somewhere they can drop their children
off and go to work, whereever.

I'd seen J. Alexander before in a little show called Kyle XY..  She was
great, with that statuesque look.. The only negative, a bit chubby in
places.. But she made an excellent transition to her next phase, w
demanding action, and looks quite fit. I'm impressed.

'In practice' this means the Taliban have a lot of stuff they can‚Äôt
maintain and will be useless in 3-6 months. Best use would be a surge
of propaganda pics and then put everything but artillery, small arms,
NVDs, and pickups up for sale.

"A study has provoked controversy in Germany because it shows that the

People might be spooked by it, then they can choose to leave condensed

At certain point one has to move on.. Society cannot keep having lockdowns.

NYT: "Britain is reporting more than 30,000 new coronavirus cases a
day, but the public seems to have moved on. Experts say this could be
a glimpse into the future for other countries... [A] professor.. 'It
looks like we‚Äôre just accepting it now ‚Äî that this is the price of
freedom.'... 'It‚Äôs really difficult to ask people not to mix for a
prolonged period, especially if there is no solution.'...  [A]
specialist... 'All our Covid cases are unvaccinated by choice'"

Handing over Iraq support to France? They do have a strategic interest
there.. wanting to stop refugees. Also indirectly protecting
Lebanon.. ? In reverse, they have a supply route open by sea, into
Lebanon then into Iraq.
