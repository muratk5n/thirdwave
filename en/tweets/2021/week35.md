"As long as the Islamic terrorists remain in Idlib, [ISIS] in the east
and Iranians near the Israeli border, the Syrian civil war will not be
over... Iran wants to repeat in Syria what it has been doing in Yemen
for several years. In Yemen Iran perfected an effective way to attack
Saudi Arabia by arming Shia rebels in Yemen with over a thousand
ballistic missiles and UAVs... Iran is seeking to carry out a similar
campaign against Israel using Iran backed militias in Syria"

Lectures can be viewed at school just as easily as they are viewed at
home. The key is content, and who delivers it.

---

If they want better education, they should ask for prerecorded lecture
videos of the experts to teach their children rather than a
parrot/doofus wildly gestulating (teacher)

---

"Children going to school" isn't preferred bcz it is better for their
education. Parents need it because in a modern setting, school
functions as a day-care center, somewhere they can drop their children
off and go to work, whereever.

I'd seen J. Alexander before in a little show called Kyle XY..  She was
great, with that statuesque look.. The only negative, a bit chubby in
places.. But she made an excellent transition to her next phase, w
demanding action, and looks quite fit. I'm impressed.

'In practice' this means the Taliban have a lot of stuff they can‚Äôt
maintain and will be useless in 3-6 months. Best use would be a surge
of propaganda pics and then put everything but artillery, small arms,
NVDs, and pickups up for sale.

worth of lost equipment means in practice for the Taliban''

"A study has provoked controversy in Germany because it shows that the
country‚Äôs healthcare system has two tiers... The study.. has shown
that patients who have statutory health insurance have to wait about
three times longer for an appointment with a specialist than members

New co-leader of Germany's left party Die Linke, talking about the
country's two-tier healthcare. It's good.. DE needs more left. There

types..

People might be spooked by it, then they can choose to leave condensed

At certain point one has to move on.. Society cannot keep having lockdowns.

NYT: "Britain is reporting more than 30,000 new coronavirus cases a
day, but the public seems to have moved on. Experts say this could be
a glimpse into the future for other countries... [A] professor.. 'It
looks like we‚Äôre just accepting it now ‚Äî that this is the price of
freedom.'... 'It‚Äôs really difficult to ask people not to mix for a
prolonged period, especially if there is no solution.'...  [A]
specialist... 'All our Covid cases are unvaccinated by choice'"

Handing over Iraq support to France? They do have a strategic interest
there.. wanting to stop refugees. Also indirectly protecting
Lebanon.. ? In reverse, they have a supply route open by sea, into
Lebanon then into Iraq.

JFK increased military spending. While he did not trust the military at
