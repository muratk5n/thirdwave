It is odd China is experiencing power issues, electricity is getting
cut, diesel, coal price is rising, yet their Southwest region has
similar solar potential as Australia.

---

Coal, NG can still contribute through CCS.

Discourage its export, is transmission, the only thing that "moves"
should be green molecules. The rest is renewable generation, either
local, and more in countries who are rich of it like some are in oil
and they export that in molecules as well (H2 pipelines or ammonia).

---

Nuclear isn't a panacea either.. For countries who have experience
with it, fine, but nuke energy has an enormous waste storage problem.

---

It's interesting how open to violence this region is, even after all
these years; things get a little funky, troublemakers come out of the
woodwork, as if on cue.

With the "emotional brain" concept I dont mean a person "getting
excited", and "in the heat of the moment" fail to make rational
decisions. No... even when a person is silently sitting with no
external stimuli or visible disturbances, they are mostly deciding
emotionally (culturally). Unless one is concious of it, it is
extremely hard to cancel out that stuff, the emotional will almost
always override the rational.

For the lazy or busy readers, here is the lithium calculation. Energy
stored per kilogram of lithium,

```python
kgkwh = 60/70 #kg/kWh
"%0.2f kg/kwh" % kgkwh
```

```text
Out[1]: '0.86 kg/kwh'
```

Divide the weight of all lithium in the world (dug up or otherwise),
17 million tons, by the number above,

```python
reserves = 17*1e6*1e3 # tonnes
batcap = reserves / kgkwh
"all battery capacity using all lithium: %0.2f kwh" % batcap
```

```text
Out[1]: 'all battery capacity using all lithium: 19833333333.33 kwh'
```

This is the maximum energy storage capacity we can have.

World consumption in one year (2013) was 157,481 Terrawatt
Hours. Divide by 365 per day, and compare,

```python
energy_daily = (157481. / (365)) * 1e9 # Kwh
"%0.2f percent" % (batcap / energy_daily * 100.0)
```

```text
Out[1]: '4.60 percent'
```

Only 5% of the energy need can be stored in batteries. That wont make
a dent in the fight against climate change.

"The Hurricane That Was So Powerful It Affected The American
Revolution.. In fact, the Great Hurricane of 1780 would go down in
history as the deadliest hurricane on record in the Atlantic and the
damage it caused was so extensive it severely weakened the British
regional efforts during the American Revolution"

This is why leadership matters and direct democracy in a modern
setting cannot work. There isn't much wisdom in the "community".

---

One gent, a hack actually, hired by CATO, Jerry Taylor, was tasked
with arguing against climate change on various media (but later
changed his mind) offers great insight into public / voter decisions,
their perceptions.. "People dont take positions because they find
themselves reasoned into those positions, they take positions they
want to take for emotional or ideological reasons and they mobilize
their reasoning power to justify taking the positions they want to
take". Essentially [same analysis](2014/06/the-culture-code.md) given
in *The Culture Code*. Emotional brain (containing culture) overrides
the analytical. Politics 101.

Fine docu, *The Campaign Against the Climate*. Saw it on Al
Jazeera. Shows how climate change skeptics worked their magic.

---

Propane packs a punch. Clean molecules cld replace it.

EIA: "Propane [is used on] farms, for heating livestock housing and
greenhouses"

---

This is why winter heating is a bigger problem than expected.. There
is more livestock than people and they also need heating. Owners dont
just sacrifice all the chickens before winter and grow new ones during
summer, right?

---

WE Forum: "Humans are easily outnumbered by our farm animals. The
combined total of chickens (19 billion), cows (1.5 billion), sheep (1
billion) and pigs (1 billion) living at any one time is three times
higher than the number of people"

Green tech inclusion in either US bills is great, obviously I care
equally abt Medicare expansion, and drug price negotiation ability.

---

Here's the deal. 0.86 kg lithium can store 1 kwh of energy. We need to
be able to store 431 Terrawatt hours per day. But there is only 17
million tonnes of reserves. Do the calculation...
