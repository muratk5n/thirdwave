# Week 31

Why? There are TCO benefits, training, maintanance all become easier
if one optimal tech can handle all.

Plus there isn't enough lithium to go around. That is an hard limit
that cannot be overcome.

H2 can do trucks, ships, airplanes.. And the solution that can handle
all cases, will displace one that can handle a few cases.

TDB: "Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is apparently tired of his GOP
colleagues bashing COVID-19 vaccines—and he’s planning to act on it at
home. The Republican lawmaker used funds from his re-election campaign
to purchase ads on more than 100 Kentucky radio stations encouraging
people to get the vaccine"

The Daily Beast: "New Dem Ad Campaign Tells Sen. Sinema: You’re ‘the
Problem’.. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema is facing a fresh round of attacks from
progressives aiming to turn up the pressure on the moderate Democrat
back home and push her leftward on their most burning issues"

F24: "French leftists unite with Greens to avoid 2022 repeat of the
Macron-Le Pen presidential duel"

---

F24: "Italy and France see rise in vaccinations despite resistance to
Covid-19 'health pass'"

For all time, it is US, China, UK, Japan, Germany, India, Russia,
France, Canada. These countries caused the most carbon pollution. They
are *guilty*. They caused our current predicament. Now they need to
bend over backwards to help the rest.

---

For 2014 China was the [worst](2021/07/historical-carbon-emissions.md)
polluter. 

"Behind the Rise of U.S. Solar Power, a Mountain of Chinese
Coal.. Reliance on coal-fired electricity to produce solar panels
raises concerns in the West"

Great that Google shares GDELT files.. But is it AI? Sadly no. The
task is excruciatingly simple, look at a text, figure out who did what
to whom, where. Yet GDT fails in these tasks at times that are
laughable to a human... I look at the doc it clearly say attack was in
Libya. GDT assigns N. Syria. Attacker is IS, it says AFG, as in
gov. You know the shit is state-of-the-art. It's Google! Their *main
job* is NLP. Yet SOTA aint good enough.

Yahoo! News: "If she filled out and submitted a [req for permission],
Biles was covered to continue taking Ritalin in Tokyo without fear of
arrest. So while it's impossible to determine what has caused Biles'
[drop out..] a lack of medication is almost certainly not to blame"

Temp 34 feels like 39, humidity 49%. Yep.

---

Absolutely, Cuba has a ruling elite.

Second Wave, whether w capitalism or communism, has [Integrators](2011/03/integrators.md).

---

All this "displacing the elite" talk is usually a ruse, the elite is
not displaced but merely *replaced* by -wait or it- another elite. It
cant work any differently within the context of modernity (second
wave)

---

"Trump as populist bcz he does what ppl want"???  What the hell u
talking abt? DT was like a self-proclaimed king! He knew everything
better than you!

Many things can be tied to self interest. Do we want ppl walking
around coughing up a lung from treatable ilness, going bankrupt from
med debt so they start breaking into ur house for money? I want
single-payer so desparation is reduced. M4A is smart policy.

"@Redistrict

One thing Trump's endorsement isn't doing so far in 2021: helping his
chosen candidates raise money. Between Susan Wright (R) in #TX06 and
Mike Carey (R) in #OH15, his candidates are getting significantly
outspent"

Yeah Maradona could run circles around 7 guys and score, but how many
times can you pull that shit off?

---

Football utilizes many of the greater-sum concepts these days; pay
attn to how players pass eachother, there is a certain pattern, there
are triangles, they advance through little passes, piece by piece,
which can build up to a GOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!!

---

Hah they are both Argentinian, good question.

I'd say Messi comes out on top. Maradona was great but he was also a
"flash in the pan" in many ways, he'd shine one game, than nothing for
many others... Messi is a professional. Delivers solid performance in
every game. Team player.

"How does Messi measure up to Maradona?"

---

Where did I get that UNICEF number: "every day 19,000 children die
from preventable causes"? I saw it on a commercial with football
player Messi.

---

Guy has a mad hatter look to him too. Is he getting pulled toward the
Cuck Side?

---

Some say Feige is behind the kerkuffle.. He did well with the MCU
pre-2020, but the new crop of stuff don't look so good..

---

IMO the movie was a dud

"Disney is sued over streaming of Black Widow"

---

Minorities, cultures, assimilation... let me put it this way.  US has
10% of its population with Irish ancestry. This probably translated
into its cultural make-up, so let's say 10% of US is culturally
Irish. This means EVERYONE in US including the so-called "Irish
people". They are not 100% Irish, they are also 10%. This might bother
some, u thought you were "special", "ethnic", but you are another boring
citizen.
