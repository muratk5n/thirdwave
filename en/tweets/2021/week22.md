Conflict Stats code update: 

New [script](2019/05/confstats.md#gdelt) takes GDELT conflict data set
for past 7 days (for Iraq and Syria) and plots attacks on a map,
markers showing the "from" actor. GDELT event codes used for filtering
were 190, 194 and 195 (the "AI" producing GDELT data isn't too
accurate, so it shows some non-attacks too. But the map can give a
rough idea).

The output is a snazzy Leaflet.js map, just click on the "Output" link
to see it.

Perhaps worse than half-assed, unverified theories in fundam physics
is half-assed but seemingly verified theories. The Big Bang's
existence is not conclusive. It is based on a few shoddy theories and
some measurements that can be explained in different ways.

But it is accepted as base truth, now new theories feel the burden to
coexist with it. This is ten times worse than weirdo bullshit like
String Theory, multiple universes, etc.

escaping as a gas and negates the need for it to be stored at low

The devoutness signal can also be used a means to stratify, create
hierarchy in society. If someone buys in, into something this out of
whack, which by the very nature of its whackiness *surely* leaves out
certain people, then you automatically are creating yourself an
"in-crowd". It's like a college fraternity, who is allowed in? The
pledge who puts panties on his head runs around half-naked screaming
"I am from outerspace" while riding a broom. That's the guy you want,
right? He is signaling he *really* wants to be in the club.

---

Tigger national narrative being so broken creates many unwanted
side-effects. Because the narrative is bizarre, only the most devout
can buy into it wholesale. Then higher-ups can use that buy-in as a
signal, to weed out normals, allowing in fanatics. Those fanatics you
can direct anywhere, to your mafiatic organizations, extrajudicial
killings, whatever.

Much interaction between peoples.

Grillo, *Pluralism and Politics of Difference*: "From the seventeenth
centuiy, [the Ottoman] *millet* [a system whereby peoples usually
grouped under religion, eg. Armenian millet] was 'probably current' in
the offices of the central government... In sum, then, *millets* were
institutions which were quite heavily organized at the top and at the
centre (in Istanbul) and thus 'existed' in some sense from the point
of view of the bureaucracy and their own leaders. In the towns and
villages of the provinces, however, the form of the institution, and
the degree of institutionalization varied greatly; in some places they
must scarcely have existed at all"

Governance culture can be different from people culture. As Tolay [said](../../2020/07/migrations-anatolia.md)

>The Persian dominance in Anatolia until Alexander the Great‚Äôs
>conquests in 380 BCE had a great impact on the political structure of
>the area (satrap system), but did not fundamentally alter the
>overwhelmingly Hellenic culture of Anatolia

TR governance is (sadly) Roman, people's culture today is of many
things; Hellenic, little Celtic, Christianity and Islam (both
variants), including, marginally, some migrants (not just "Turks").

Assange story shows, MSM wasnt insterested, and bcz they weren't, ppl
werent either. 

There is still a filtering mechanism, and they are at the center of
it. At least in the developed world where media isn't completely sold
out.. We want them to be better of course.

---

G. Greenwald: "I remember [Assange] telling me the story that he
learned very early on which is when Wikileaks would get documents they
would put them on the Internet they wanted the entire public to be
made aware of them, and they would then contact journalists at the New
York Times the Washington Post, The Guardian, BBC and they would say
we have this incredibly explosive document sitting here, on the
Internet .. and no one was interested in it because they didn't think
it was exclusive..

That was why Wikileaks began partnering with the media in the Snowden
case when Edward Snowden came to us .. precisely because we weren't
part of the establishment press, but we realized .. that if we didn't
partner with long large media outlets it would be very easy for the US
government to demonize and stigmatize us as something other than
journalists. They would say we were hackers we were activists they and
so .. we partnered, and did the story with The Guardian, Laura did
hers mostly with the Washington Post some with Der Spiegel, and even
the New York Times and it gave a measure of protection.

So when I got this material in Brazil, and remember this is four
months after Bolsonaro got inaugurated, this huge right-wing movement
took over the entire country, he was at the peak of his power, we
didn't know what he was capable of doing in terms of press freedom. He
had sworn over and over that he would usher in dictatorship era
repression and I knew we needed the buy-in of the large Brazilian
media or we would easily be depicted not as journalists but as
criminals, especially since I'm not a Brazilian citizen despite living
in this country for 15 years.. we were able to partner with Folio of
Sao Paulo which is essentially the New York Times of Brazil the
largest newspaper in in the country"

An established media channel isn't just about a building, offices, HR

for his tell-all. They have resources to follow up, checking if this
guy is real. who can do that? John, Jane, Greg, mentored by Dave,
whatever. Greg is out, will send Jane. If not John.  How is the random
TikTok jagoff going to handle that? No institution, no nothing. It's

'This is breathing nitrogen in and breathing ammonia out,' said
MacFarlane, showing his fuel cell. It is almost the size of a hockey
puck and clad in stainless steel. Two plastic tubes on the cell‚Äôs
backside feed it nitrogen gas and water. It has a power cord for
