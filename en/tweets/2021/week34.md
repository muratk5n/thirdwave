# Week 34

Walmart/Amazon were spending the same amt to generate similar revenue,
then AMZN CapEx started to climb. Now WMT looks better.

Unless.. one is going for diversity in biz (as w AMZN, has a cloud biz
and retail)

---

Checking Amazon, Walmart

```python
import yf
ds = ["Revenue  (ttm)", "Capital Expenditure"] 
yf.get_disp("AMZN",ds)
yf.get_disp("WMT",ds)
```

```text
AMZN ['Revenue  (ttm): 443.3B', "Capital Expenditure: ('-52,256,000', '-40,140,000', '-16,861,000')"]
WMT ['Revenue  (ttm): 566.14B', "Capital Expenditure: ('-11,714,000', '-10,264,000', '-10,705,000')"]
```

Makes sense, if you are continuously spending money to make money,
during high inflation u'd need to more of that money to make the same
amount. Sure cld pass the cost to consumers, but that's no fun..

CNBC: "'The best businesses during inflation are the businesses that
you buy once and then you donâ€™t have to keep making capital
investments subsequently,' Buffett said, adding that 'any business
with heavy capital investment tends to be a poor business to be in in
inflation and often itâ€™s a poor business to be in generally.'"

ðŸ¤£ Good one.. Bcz cockroaches wld make it right, survive a

Bad review on *Reminiscence* from ABC Oz. "Buckles under the weight of

Tony Blair talking shit?

Even if there is a single soldier there, that steals valuable
think-time IMO.. Now the country is an "open case", along with other
tasks, you have to worry about it, think about it, in military
terms.. I dont think central govs have that kind of attn, processing
time.. Now militarily they'll roll it up in a broad terrorism effort,
and the rest will be diplomacy, more comfortable ground for civilian
gov.

"By 2004... [UN rep] Brahimi had realised that keeping the Taliban out
of the Bonn process was a mistake. In an interview in 2004, he
described it as the â€˜original sinâ€™. Result: about 48 per cent Pashtun
got some 15 percent of share in power (this excluded Taliban and their
constituencies)...

This concept of centralisation and lopsided ethnic representation also
informed the formation of [the Afghan military].. Because the force
remained ethnically fragmented, no amount of training or equipment
could induce the overall, organic tribalism that informs successful
militaries"

"Australia anti-lockdown rallies: protesters violently clash with police in Melbourne"

They might not call themselves that but Fox News is MSM

Most CC today is badly designed but an ideal one (like a left-wing
version of Nano) cld be basis for a new econ. The world with such
change would be drastically different. How different is different? See
the monumental shift from agrarian to industrial England. If one lived
back then, there'd come a time, within a span of ~50 yrs, before /
after of the place would look completely different. Before would be
carriages, slow life, hand-sewn clothing, after, train, steam ships,
manufactured clothing, much faster life. Radical change. Day and
night. Oil and water.

How to know a solution is 3W? Does it fit under [these](2011/04/fundamentals-of-industrial-ideologies.md) ?
If not, and new, 3W.

---

H2 fuel is that rare and ingenious solution.. It swaps one fuel for
another, so all kinds of distribution, central management,
concentration dynamics can apply as-is (along w people who make money
from it). At the same time, new fuels can support off-grid,
self-sustained living, see Lavo in Australia. Here renewable fuel
works for 3W.

---

Are renewable fuels a Second Wave or Third Wave development? They are
useful for both.

MSM delivers.. They arranged interviews with 30 officials.

Soviets aren't entirely blameless either. They also contributed to
AFG's current misery.

Vox: "[I]n 1978, when [AFG President] Daoud Khan is formally
overthrown in whatâ€™s known as the Saur Revolution.. a Marxist-Leninist
government is established...[Then] the United States starts to slowly
funnel money toward some resistance groups"
