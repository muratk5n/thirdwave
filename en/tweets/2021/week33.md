If you believe that social media can replace peer review, consider my
experience. Every paper I've published has been improved by peer
review. I can't say the same for comments on Twitter. I may not always
agree with reviewers but they spend hours with my paper, not seconds"

---

Laws in physical sciences are mathematical, the best ones are usually
incredibly compact, intelligeble, in continuous form. In order to
compute them the formulas are 'discretized' (a whole branch of sci
itself), approximation is introduced, checked against data.

In ML, or so-called "AI", things work the other way around; they start
with approximation, computation first, and... stay there. They don't
have a formula for their domain. There is no mathematical model of
thought.. all they have is bunch of 'patterns' captured from raw data
in an unintelligeble format.

If anyone thinks one can reach human level AI from this, I have a
bridge to sell them.

"Is Machine Learning compatible with the Scientific Method?.. [P]art
of what we celebrate as scientific progress is the transition from the
data (observed orbits) to patterns in the data (Kepler’s laws) to
theories explaining the data (Newtonian theory of
gravity). [.. M]erely identifying the hidden correlations in the data
is generally not enough in science. It is the explanation of why these
patterns exist with the aid of a more fundamental and universally
applicable scientific theory ... that we acknowledge and cherish as
scientific progress"

*Charlie Wilson's War*'s message was about US "leaving" Afghanistan in
1989, after the Soviets left, not reforming the country.. Well-meaning
thought.. except US **didn't** leave. They [stayed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/27/10-myths-about-afghanistan)
and continued stirring things up, helping entrench the civil war there between
mujahideen and the central government.

Without being AI automation can still do a lot of damage (the good
kind damage, the kind that kills jobs)

---

"Although machines like [the sorter below] look incredibly complex,
[manager] says that they are actually pretty simple. The decision to
whether or not to reject a piece of produce (or stone, or clod of
earth, as often happens) is a yes/no question that can be answered
without much calculation. Likewise, because the rejectors are spread
out in line, it's just a matter of timing to pick the right one to
knock out the offending article. And over the years the machines have
gotten good"

Actually Dubya WH worked through local warlords. Bama WH made a major

Clearly both methods failed.

What food was foreign to (most) hunter-gatherers? Tomatoes. For many
in the "Old World", until 16th century there were no tomatoes. The veg
is associated with Italian cooking, but this is a mistake, a recent
development... They, nor or the Greeks, or anyone wld have known it
before 16th.. So if you dont like tomatoes, do not feel
bad. Biologically we did not need it, not part of our evolution, so
can safely be eliminated from diets.

There was no god damn [missile gap](../../2021/08/cuban-missile-crisis.md#gap).
JFK either lied or foolishly believed in it himself, likely the former.
There was a missile gap much earlier, that's why US placed missiles in TR.
Bcz of the 60s missile gap, this time with USSR at a disadvantage, USSR
wanted to place missiles in Cuba.

"How about the missile gap of 1960s? JFK won the election thanks to it"

Another Berlin story, [Checkpoint Charlie](../../2021/08/cuban-missile-crisis.md#berlin). 
One tank moves back five meters, the other too, and another.. Major standoff.

It's true, the North Korean embassy in Berlin is also a hostel. I
passed by it many times.. At first u dont realize it, first see the
hostel, keep walking, while turning around the corner, u notice the NK
stuff. Then it's like 'wait.. it's the same building!'

NYT: "[A Sicilian town Floridia] is perhaps the most blisteringly hot
town in the recorded history of Europe, offering Italy and the entire
Mediterranean a preview of a sweltering and potentially uninhabitable
future brought on by the globe’s changing climate... [A] nearby
monitoring station registered a temperature of ... nearly 49 degrees
Celsius....  the unprecedented heat rendered Floridia a blindingly
bright ghost town, with its bars deserted, its baroque and
sand-colored churches darkened, its piazzas emptied.In the surrounding
fields, the area’s famed snails burned in their shells. The relentless
sun branded the verdello green lemons with yellow blots and stewed
their flesh within. Everyone holed up in their houses. The
air-conditioning they blasted prompted blackouts"

Amazon?

```python
q = yf.get_financials("AMZN")
print ('AMZN', [(d[:20] + ': ' + q[d]) for d in ds])
```

```text
AMZN ['Revenue  (ttm): 443.3B', 'Quarterly Revenue Gr: 27.20%', 'Quarterly Earnings G: 48.40%']
```

Earnings growth 48.40%? Is that right?

Now we know where all that pandemic spnding went.

---

The company certainly helped itself by pushing for content like *The
Mandalorian*, becoming less cuck

---

Disney raked it in..? Let's check


```python
import yf

ds = ["Revenue  (ttm)", "Quarterly Revenue Growth  (yoy)",\
      "Quarterly Earnings Growth  (yoy)"]
      
q = yf.get_financials("NFLX")
print ('NFLX', [(d[:20] + ': ' + q[d]) for d in ds])
q = yf.get_financials("DIS")
print ('DIS', [(d[:20] + ': ' + q[d]) for d in ds])
```

```text
NFLX ['Revenue  (ttm): 27.59B', 'Quarterly Revenue Gr: 19.40%', 'Quarterly Earnings G: 87.90%']
DIS ['Revenue  (ttm): 63.59B', 'Quarterly Revenue Gr: 44.50%', 'Quarterly Earnings G: N/A']
```

DIS rev growth looks good
