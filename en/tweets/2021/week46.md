Morocco has the world's largest Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant,
Ouarzazate Solar Power Station. It covers 3,000 hectares (the size of
3,500 football fields), and can be seen from space. It generates 580MW
of electricity, and will power 1 million homes and numerous cities"

2010 and 2019 - according to @IRENA - 'making it a desirable option
for use in developing countries'"

Marmite is extremely potent. It's like condensed Guiness.

---

Fantastic history to all these things. Fine innovation.

Wiki: "The product that was to become Marmite was invented during the
late 19th century when German scientist Justus von Liebig discovered
that brewer's yeast could be concentrated, bottled and eaten...  By
1912, the discovery of vitamins was a boost for Marmite, as the spread
is a rich source of the vitamin B complex; with the vitamin B1
deficiency beriberi being common during World War I, the spread became
more popular. British troops during World War I were issued Marmite as
part of their rations"

Marmite.. This guy puts it in the veg patties.. B-complex bomb.
This can work, approaching beef quality here.

*Shang Chi*, same, little more SJW.. Got the cold shoulder from CCP,
lost millions coulda had.. Not sure MCU can build this towards
something.. The character is too marginal afaik.

*No Time to Die* was Bond enough.. There was some SJW. Good action,
tech.

Centrism got its ass kicked in Virginia. Trump derangement, running
specifically against Trump didn't work. Not being able to hit the
opponent on Carlyle, like a leftist could, then getting mired in
culture war like a 90s centrist Clintonite destroyed the guy. I loved
it.

---

It was fitting that the first crisis in Clinton WH was a hot-button
social issue, not an economic issue. For econ they'd do NAFTA and
everyone was on board for that, except that one weird guy with the
squeky voice.. In a debate on the subject Perot (that weird guy with
the squeky voice) would argue against, Gore wld argue for, and one of
the "eminent characters" Gore would pull out of his bag to support his
case would be Powell. He was apparently for NAFTA -- and why wouldn't
he be? He was a Republican.

---

Let's not forget Colin Powell was beloved by Reps not because he
was a good general but because he fought in the culture war and
"scored one on the libs"

\#DontAskDontTell

Bipartisanship needs to get a demotion from being a remarkable event,
to something regular, and unremarkable. You agree on some stuff (key
is 'some', agreeing on all, especially econ, is harmful), you get them
done. What's the big deal..?

NO SHOW STOPPERS

"No show stoppers for Concentrating Solar Power... A recently published
study confirms that solar thermal power is largely unrestricted by
materials availability"

Based on paper below, assuming a solar PV panel uses 0.2 g indium per
square meter (a low assumption, paper has it higher, 0.38 g/m2), 300 W
/ m2 solar energy, with 30% panel efficiency, and given world reserves
of indium is 5700 tons,

```python
m2 = 5700*1e6 / 0.2
km2 = m2 / 1e6
print (km2, 'km2')

world = 157481.
eff = 0.30
kw = m2*(300*eff) / 1000.0
twh_year = (kw*24*365) / 1e9
print ('%0.2f percent' % (twh_year / world * 100.0))
```

```text
28500.0 km2
14.27 percent
```

only 14% of world energy requirement can be generated through PV solar
tech, given the indium reserves and its usage. There are other
rare-earth metals too, cadmium, tellerium..

---

AZO Cleantech: "[R]ecent research coming out of the Netherlands has
spotted a red flag to relying on solar panels as a panacea for global
emissions problems. Experts have found that the rare metals required
to build solar panels, such as indium and tellurium, are not in
sufficient supply to keep up with demand... Currently, China is
providing the world.. Yet [CH] is no longer abundant with precious
metals"

Electrons are fickle.. Must base the new energy system on things with
more of substance; gas, liquids, molecules, heat, pressure.

"The advantage of the thermal reflector systems is that because they
initially produce heat, this heat can be stored, and itâ€™s an important
consideration if you need to produce electricity after
sunset. Photovoltaic panels, on the other hand, produce electricity
immediately, making storing electricity less efficient. The Negev
Energy project uses a molten salt storage system that enables it to
hold and provide additional 4.5 hours of clean energy each day, at
full capacity, even after sunset or during cloudy days"

Increasing productivity decreases inflation..? The effect has too long

Downtrend on Biden's popularity did not start on Aug; it has been

debacle, net pop wld have been at -5, with Aug debacle (AFG pullout)
it went to -10% territory.

US, instead of triggering a "Shale Revolution" in 2005, could have
gone solar, expanded its already substantial H2 pipeline capacity,
help commercialize fuel-cells NASA developed in the 60s.

Instead of building those ghost cities China could have built thermo
solar plants and at this point be energy sufficient, and carbon
neutral.

"Despite the hopeful attitude during the 1950s and 1960s, it was soon
acknowledged that Artificial Intelligence was a much harder problem
than initially assumed. Today, AI capable of thinking like a human is
referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI) and still firmly
the realm of science-fiction. Much of what we call â€˜AIâ€™ today is in
fact artificial narrow intelligence (ANI, or Narrow AI)"

Bloomberg: "It's become the conventional wisdom that the U.S. economy
is built on Americans' endless appetite to buy lots and lots of
stuff. Household consumption makes up about 67% of GDP. When the
economy falters, we're told spending is our patriotic duty. But
suddenly, Americans canâ€™t spend like they used to. Store shelves are
emptying, and it can take months to find a car, refrigerator or
sofa. If this continues, we may need to learn to do without â€” and,
horrors, live more like the Europeans. That actually might not be a
bad thing, because the U.S. economy could be healthier if it were less
reliant on consumption"

Subsidies? Both fossil and renewable get it at first.. to make sure
people dont revolt as in France yellow vests. Until both options are
on par -in terms of infra, support (repair, maintainence, second-hand
sales)-, then subsidies for the former can be cut off.

---

Need to work the incentives.. What do countries like? Cheap
energy. Countries with know-how develop thermosolar-H2 locally, then,
or at the same time, build a few of those for other countries,
transferring know-how..

"Agriculture is responsible for X percent of emissions"... A better
analysis would drill down to each use-case. Agro emissons.. from what?
Are emissions coming from the tractors used on the fields, or the
heating needed for the greenhouses (as in greenhouse farming), or the
animals, or something else? If the biggest use-case is known, you can
priotrize the tech for that.

It is not inconceivable in order to open itself a new space of
influence in ME, Qatar used Syrian conflict; the ME region's balance
was too tied in the US/SA/Israel/Egypt quad, cemented, and upstarts
like Qatar felt like had to go around them. Another upstart, TR, was
pulled into the quagmire along w Qatar for the same reason (notice the
strong relations between the two).

---

Saw a few times on Al Jazeera (financed by Qatar) whenever Assad is
mentioned, his name is qualified with something like THAT \#$%@#
TYRANT, or something similar .. Makes u flinch.. the tone doesnt fit
with otherwise mostly neutral sounding voice of the news channel.

---

Al Jazeera: "Qatar has no plan to normalise ties with Syria: Foreign minister"

---

Reuters: "UAE reopens Syria embassy in boost for Assad"

---

There are "leaks" today claiming mid-Sep 2012 Qatar (with France!) was
plotting to topple Assad. Dunno if true, but QTR did act "outside the
mainstream ME power centers" in near past, and had a few scuffles with
SA.

Added those to the [timeline](../../2017/12/timeline-syria-tr.md),
search for SA, QTR.

Later industrial production and society did the same to farmers, made
them obsolete, structures built around that earlier era were done away
with. Empires whose being depended on land/plunder/peasants collapsed,
like the Ottomans. Farming itself became industrialized, where a
fraction of population engaged in such work could produce enough for
millions.

Cheap contrarianism. It was clear-cut. Foragers were

farmers.
