# Week 46

US, instead of triggering a "Shale Revolution" in 2005, could have
gone solar, expanded its already substantial H2 pipeline capacity,
help commercialize fuel-cells NASA developed in the 60s.

---

Instead of building those ghost cities China could have built thermo
solar plants and at this point be energy sufficient, and carbon
neutral.

NYT: "Urbanites in Canada Flock to Atlantic Region Amid Remote Work
Shift.. As housing prices soar in big cities, the country’s eastern
provinces are experiencing a surge in migration. Newcomers are being
welcomed, but some locals are wary"

"Despite the hopeful attitude during the 1950s and 1960s, it was soon
acknowledged that Artificial Intelligence was a much harder problem
than initially assumed. Today, AI capable of thinking like a human is
referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI) and still firmly
the realm of science-fiction. Much of what we call ‘AI’ today is in
fact artificial narrow intelligence (ANI, or Narrow AI)"

Bloomberg: "It's become the conventional wisdom that the U.S. economy
is built on Americans' endless appetite to buy lots and lots of
stuff. Household consumption makes up about 67% of GDP. When the
economy falters, we're told spending is our patriotic duty. But
suddenly, Americans can’t spend like they used to. Store shelves are
emptying, and it can take months to find a car, refrigerator or
sofa. If this continues, we may need to learn to do without — and,
horrors, live more like the Europeans. That actually might not be a
bad thing, because the U.S. economy could be healthier if it were less
reliant on consumption"

Subsidies? Both fossil and renewable get it at first.. to make sure
people dont revolt as in France yellow vests. Until both options are
on par -in terms of infra, support (repair, maintainence, second-hand
sales)-, then subsidies for the former can be cut off.

---

Need to work the incentives.. What do countries like? Cheap
energy. Countries with know-how develop thermosolar-H2 locally, then,
or at the same time, build a few of those for other countries,
transferring know-how..

---

I'm sure ppl at COP26 made the best deal they could with that
gathering.. And there is room to do more.

[Looks](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FEF9quAWYBALdvn?format=jpg&name=small)
pretty bad...

Reuters: "New Delhi to shut schools, construction sites as pollution
worsens... Air quality in Delhi... has declined due to crop stubble
burning, emissions from transport, coal-fired plants outside the city
and other industry, as well as open garbage burning and dust."

---

"India to achieve 50% clean energy share...  before 2030.. India will
have around 450 GW from solar and wind, while 70-100 GW will be from
hydropower plants"

---

"Agriculture is responsible for X percent of emissions"... A better
analysis would drill down to each use-case. Agro emissons.. from what?
Are emissions coming from the tractors used on the fields, or the
heating needed for the greenhouses (as in greenhouse farming), or the
animals, or something else? If the biggest use-case is known, you can
priotrize the tech for that.

It’s going to take money and lots of it to solve the climate crisis

It is not inconceivable in order to open itself a new space of
influence in ME, Qatar used Syrian conflict; the ME region's balance
was too tied in the US/SA/Israel/Egypt quad, cemented, and upstarts
like Qatar felt like had to go around them. Another upstart, TR, was
pulled into the quagmire along w Qatar for the same reason (notice the
strong relations between the two).

---

Saw a few times on Al Jazeera (financed by Qatar) whenever Assad is
mentioned, his name is qualified with something like THAT \#$%@#
TYRANT, or something similar .. Makes u flinch.. the tone doesnt fit
with otherwise mostly neutral sounding voice of the news channel.

---

Al Jazeera: "Qatar has no plan to normalise ties with Syria: Foreign minister"

---

Reuters: "UAE reopens Syria embassy in boost for Assad"

---

There are "leaks" today claiming mid-Sep 2012 Qatar (with France!) was
plotting to topple Assad. Dunno if true, but QTR did act "outside the
mainstream ME power centers" in near past, and had a few scuffles with
SA.

Added those to the [timeline](2017/12/timeline-syria-tr.md),
search for SA, QTR.

workers are quitting in droves amid the ‘Great Resignation’ – and a
growing movement is antiwork altogether"

Later industrial production and society did the same to farmers, made
them obsolete, structures built around that earlier era were done away
with. Empires whose being depended on land/plunder/peasants collapsed,
like the Ottomans. Farming itself became industrialized, where a
fraction of population engaged in such work could produce enough for
millions.

---

Cheap contrarianism. It was clear-cut. Foragers were
[replaced](2017/10/wtwrfn-foragers-farmers.md#replaced) en masse by
farmers.

"The progression of history was not clear-cut, from hunter-gathering to
farming"
