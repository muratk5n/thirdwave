Ammonia can be 'cracked' to extract H2. It can be combusted cleanly
for turbines (Japan demostrated how). There are even ammonia fuel-cell

I prefer CSP but if political horse trading requires it, here's a way
for coal.

Paper: "One of the most promising options for generating power from
coal, whilst capturing at a minimum efficiency penalty CO2, is based
on gasification. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants
can be built [.. with carbon capture rates] above 90%... More
importantly, gasification systems produce hydrogen as a fuel gas,
which can be purified and used in a low carbon economy where hydrogen
is foreseen to be a major energy carrier."

Not Even Wrong Blog: "Multiverse mania started seriously among string

The Anthropic Landscape of String Theory. At the time I was finishing

view would get any traction.. It has become clear recently that we‚Äôve
now reached that end-point. From the new video of his discussion with
Rovelli, it‚Äôs clear that David Gross has given up. No more complaints
about the multiverse from him, and his vision of the future has string

The reason Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.. They were starved off
resources, so wanted to gobble up Southeast Asia's resources to make

while Japan did the deed.. Hope was US would not respond heavily

True. Exp growth depends on the existing population size. X number of
people have children proportional to X. Exponential. Usually people
use exponential to subtitute a mathy-sounding word instead of more
pedestrian one, to show off. In most cases there is only multiples of
simple increase. The TV show *Numb3rs* had the best line, "not
'exponential', just 'more'".
