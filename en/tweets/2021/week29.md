# Week 29

Beckley: "Yes history has shown that technological revolutions create
prosperity in the long run but every single time one of these things
has happened they have forced some workers into lower wage jobs or
into unemployment in the short run, and the short run can actually
last an entire lifetime. So if you study the Industrial Revolution,
one of the biggest technological revolutions, for the first 70 years
of the industrial revolution in the Great Britain from 1770 to 1840,
average wages actually stagnated, and living standards declined.  The
average height of men actually shrunk because they had less nutrition
over that 70 years, even as output per worker expanded by nearly 50
percent, that's because the gains from mass mechanization during that
time were largely captured by business elites...

[In our future, due to automation] there could be a world where you
would have sluggish growth, lots of debt, stagnant wages, for at least
a big part of the population, and extreme inequality. If you had that
kind of economic world that of course would breed nationalism and
extremism"

I am not entirely convinced Cuban regime wants the ambargo to end..
Why would they? It is the perfect scapegoat. Some during the 90s did
claim convincingly Castro was making moves for it, to keep the
ambargo.

likely hurting Al Gore and later Hilary, respectively, in Florida.

There are a boat load of examples where a Dem was screwed bcz of
Cuba..  You could claim Clinton lost gov in 1980 partly bcz of
Castro. Cuba sent refugees to US, Carter dumped them on Arkansas,
there was a ruckus, Cubans escaped from camp and armed citizens nearly
shot them to death. Some other factors were there 2, but the refugee
issue loomed large.

Providing "gonzo Internet" to Cuba.. good idea.
