Bust the Filibuster

NYT: "[A]fter a Republican filibuster on Wednesday blocked the
Democrats’ latest proposal to combat the voting-rights restrictions
proliferating in red states, [Dems] now squarely faces the choice that
many activists consider an even more existential decision: whether it
will reform the filibuster to pass that legislation"

*Dune* wasn't cuck. In fact they even reversed some stuff from
elsewhere; Oscar Isaac was cucked on Disney Star Wars, he was
uncucked. Movie had freaking Thanos. Momoa, obviously. There was that
action chick a lot of men like, with T. Cruise stamp of approval. The
movie was pretty balanced actually, it felt like a pre-derangement
flick ..

Transportation of goods and people account for 25% of world energy
consumption. Only 10% of WEC can be handled by li-on batteries. 25% is
greater than 10% - simple math. This sorry excuse of a tech can't even
handle all of transportation.

"[2019] The US military’s logistical train is slowly snaking toward
China... the center of military policy is increasingly gravitating
toward U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, according to U.S. government
officials. [T]he challenge is how to quicken the pace because the
logistical tail of warfare takes time to put in place and because the
Pacific theater is one of the most difficult environments for moving
supplies"

movie set in 1993 in which the actor Brandon Lee, Bruce Lee’s son, was
shot and killed during a scene when a bullet that was lodged in the
barrel of a gun was discharged along with a blank cartridge"

Because battery charging is slow, they need to apply too much power,
to recharge faster. That will overburden the grid, also degrade the
battery. Finally ka-boom!

National Geographic: "At high charging speeds lithium batteries can
overheat, causing them to degrade over time.. [N]ot only can that
drastically reduce the battery’s capacity... dendrites can grow across
the electrolyte, touch the cathode and create a short circuit, causing
the battery to catch fire or explode"

"After a major fire in Stuttgart: Munich pulls eight battery buses out
of service...  other transport companies are drawing conclusions. The
Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft (MVG) is now taking eight electric buses
out of service as a precaution.. In Stuttgart, the electric charging
station was destroyed in the fire on September 30th. Therefore, no
electric buses are currently in use"
