The Intercept: "By 2013, the Obama administration had concluded that
it could not charge WikiLeaks or Julian Assange with crimes related to
publishing classified documents ‚Äî documents that showed, among other
things, evidence of U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan ‚Äî without
criminalizing investigative journalism itself. [.. DOJ] called this
the ‚ÄúNew York Times problem,‚Äù because if WikiLeaks and Assange were
criminals for publishing classified information, the New York Times
would be just as guilty.

Five years later, in 2018, the Trump administration indicted Assange
anyway. But, rather than charging him with espionage for publishing
classified information, they charged him with conspiracy to commit a
computer crime..

The alleged hacking not only didn‚Äôt happen, according to expert
testimony, but it also couldn‚Äôt have happened"

The map shared [before](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FCtre5sWEAgFFp9?format=png&name=small)
says sunlight radiation at maximum is ~300 W/m2. The number we used
previously  ~1000 W/m2 is widely known, sun at its zenith, an ideal
situation. For daily calculations you factor in sun availability,
less direct sunlight, etc, you can probably arrive at the numbers
seen in that map. For more accurate, region specific calculations
that need a simple, daily number, I'd go with the numbers there.

In 2019, EU's gross electricity production was 2904 TWh. In output
capacity terms,

```python
"%d GW" % (2904000 / 365.0 / 24)

```text
Out[1]: '331 GW'
```

The planned H2 capacity compares well with the number above.. The plan
will likely encourage others to jump in, it wld be great to equal that
331 GW.

Because battery charging is slow, they need to apply too much power,
to recharge faster. That will overburden the grid, also degrade the
battery. Finally ka-boom!

National Geographic: "At high charging speeds lithium batteries can
overheat, causing them to degrade over time.. [N]ot only can that
drastically reduce the battery‚Äôs capacity... dendrites can grow across
the electrolyte, touch the cathode and create a short circuit, causing
the battery to catch fire or explode"
