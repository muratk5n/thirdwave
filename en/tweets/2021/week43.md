No I dont judge Baldwin for using guns in movies.. There is no
'gotcha' here. Reagan, a conservative, used guns on the big screen,
and he was for gun control. Films are escapism.

"[An] armorer with a decade‚Äôs experience in film.. said he has

TDB: "It has been a summer of scrutiny for the ultra-rich‚Äîand now the
billionaires are fighting amongst themselves. The culprit: a so-called
'Billionaire Income Tax', that Democrats in Congress are reportedly
mulling to help finance¬†Biden‚Äôs agenda. The proposal would only target
several hundred of the wealthiest Americans by taxing the rising
values of certain assets, like stocks, even before they are sold...

'I know a lot of people that‚Ä¶ have accumulated massive, massive
wealth, and then they take loans against that to live on. And that's
tax free. And I think it‚Äôs bullshit' [.. one] said"

People in Northern Syria use olive oil extract to make a flammable
[product](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/syria/2021/10/18/syrian-workers-use-olive-oil-to-make-eco-friendly-pomace-wood-in-pictures/)
for heating (by "eco-friendly" they mean that carbon neutralness
again, but it is still harmful). I bet stuff like this contributes a
lot to the CO2 uptick during the winters. Lay in the pipe for these
places for renewable gas, or send canisters, make'm cheap, done.

Report shows 90% carbon capture rates both for coal and natgas. 

US DOE: "Steam reforming of natural gas for hydrogen production costs
vary from 1.43/kg to 2.27/kg [dollars] with CO2 capture and storage
(CCS).. Numerous studies report the cost of hydrogen from gasification
[from coal] to vary between 1.16/kg and 1.63/ kg for coal and between
1.31/kg and 2.06/kg for coal/biomass/waste plastic with CO2 capture
and storage"

In 2019, EU's gross electricity production was 2904 TWh. In output
capacity terms,

```python
"%d GW" % (2904000 / 365.0 / 24)
```

```text
Out[1]: '331 GW'
```

The planned H2 capacity compares well with the number above.. The plan
will likely encourage others to jump in, it wld be great to equal that
331 GW.

AP: "The phrase 'Let‚Äôs go Brandon' refers to a meme that emerged
earlier this month from a video of an interview with NASCAR driver
Brandon Brown after he won an Xfinity Series race at Alabama‚Äôs
Talladega Superspeedway.

A reporter said on air that fans behind him were chanting 'Let‚Äôs go
Brandon,' when video footage indicates the actual chant was 'F--- Joe
Biden.' Some people have suggested the reporter purposefully
misinterpreted the crowd‚Äôs chant and the quote has become a
catchphrase among critics of Biden"

movie was pretty balanced actually, it felt like a pre-derangement

Transportation of goods and people account for 25% of world energy
consumption. Only 10% of WEC can be handled by li-on batteries. 25% is
greater than 10% - simple math. This sorry excuse of a tech can't even
handle all of transportation.

Because battery charging is slow, they need to apply too much power,
to recharge faster. That will overburden the grid, also degrade the
battery. Finally ka-boom!

National Geographic: "At high charging speeds lithium batteries can
overheat, causing them to degrade over time.. [N]ot only can that
drastically reduce the battery‚Äôs capacity... dendrites can grow across
the electrolyte, touch the cathode and create a short circuit, causing
the battery to catch fire or explode"

These things keep catching fire..

I bet it has something to do with fast charging. 

"After a major fire in Stuttgart: Munich pulls eight battery buses out
of service...  other transport companies are drawing conclusions. The
M√ºnchner Verkehrsgesellschaft (MVG) is now taking eight electric buses
out of service as a precaution.. In Stuttgart, the electric charging
station was destroyed in the fire on September 30th. Therefore, no
electric buses are currently in use"
