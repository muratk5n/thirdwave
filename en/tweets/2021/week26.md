# Week 26

Many of the WWII participants avoid the "N-word", like US. If a word
in the neighborhood is rarely needed patriotism is used instead. Some
in Trump WH tried to bring it back, as in "economic natinoalism" but
it didn't work.

Needless to say the word is everywhere in TR.

There is some outdated lingo around this issue.. Just because you call
yourself "communist" that doesn't automatically make your opponent
"nationalist". Or said country isn't nationalist itself.. Nationalism
can infect anyone..

Yea.. I was told not only EA was against SAF, he was the poster-child
for its opposition. For the campaign however, he probably wanted to
balance that image, that's why he was more "pro-cop", with all that

New Yorker: "Adams spoke out against [stop-and-frisk] abuses at its
height, and testified in a federal trial that prompted the department
to drastically reduce the number of stops its officers made. But, now
that the fight has been won by the reformers, he has become a lonely
voice speaking up for stop-and-frisk as a necessary police tactic if
it is used in a limited and appropriate way"

Events in Egypt showed the weakness of 'political people power'
argument.. These "Twitter, Facebook uprisings" resulted in
dictatorship.

Institutions matter..  After the Tahrir protests and fall of Mobarak,
one of the few organized actors were the M. Brotherhood, which weren't
representative, nor experienced enough to lead Egypt anywhere. In fact
MB themselves were the result of the monkey show Mobarak put out there
to lull the West into thinking he had an opposition. But when MB
actually took power it was apparent they lacked the necessary support,
and culture to bring about change.. Then they were taken down by the
other institution more entrenched than theirs, the military, while the
man on the street cheered on.

"During the Vietnam War, the U.S military engaged in an aggressive

to 1971, the U.S. military sprayed a range of herbicides across more
than 4.5 million acres of Vietnam to destroy the forest cover and food
crops used by enemy North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops...

In addition to the massive environmental devastation of the
U.S. defoliation program in Vietnam, that nation has reported that
some 400,000 people were killed or maimed as a result of exposure to
herbicides like Agent Orange"

There is [a plant](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2129691/chile-opens-vast-thermosolar-power-plant) in Chile,
they do some ultraviolet trickery, 700 hectares, 210 megawatts,

```python
hectare = 1000 # m2
"%0.2f percent efficiency" % (((210*1000*1000 / (700*hectare)) / sun_on_earth) * 100.0)
```

```text
Out[1]: '30.00 percent efficiency'
```

Ok.. not bad.. 

---

Solar panels are at 20%. They are stuck there, but comparatively
speaking CSP is much lower than panels.

---

```python
acre = 4046.86 # m2
sun_on_earth = 1000 # W/m2
"%0.2f percent efficiency" % (((1*1000*1000 / (5*acre)) / sun_on_earth) * 100.0)
```

```text
Out[1]: '4.94 percent efficiency'
```

Not good

"While land needs will vary by technology, a typical CSP plant requires
5 to 10 acres of land per MW of capacity"

---

Sunlight Refineries...  Or concentrating solar-powered (CSP)
installations .. They focus sunlight into one spot through mirrors,
generate heat.

What is the efficiency of the system I wonder

Salt's antibacterial abilities are overlooked.. For preserving meat
dont we add salt (as well as drying)? Salt is added not bcz it tastes
good (nat selection might have introduced that later on), we add salt
because bacteria doesn't like salt. I argue same applies for skin
care; after a good swim in the sea, don't we feel better? The skin
feels better.. The Dead Sea is the world's saltiest body of water, and
it's known to have curative effects.. There is no magic here; just
plain ol' salt.

Joyce, who will be sworn in as deputy prime minister on Tuesday, said
his party will only support an energy policy that bolsters the

on fossil fuel mining"

universal health care, ample paid vacation time, and affordable child

It was tried, results aren't good. See Tom Gowers' [polymath project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project).
PM was a designed to be a "massively collaborative mathematical project" with
the goal of solving a research problem.. Throughout it all however, it
always seemed to me Gowers was doing more work keeping the thing
together than actually enjoying its results, he was putting more work
in than he was getting out basically.. so the project is a fail. On
focused work, you need focused expert(s) of similar stature, so they can
reach a fruitful result.. Creation requires intention. Only intention
can put together the necessary pieces to generate nonlinear power. Bunch of
jagoffs "coming together" in an ad-hoc fashion will not bring about
major change.
