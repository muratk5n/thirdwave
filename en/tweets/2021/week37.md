If you go apeshit on discretization no need for extra turb model.  But
apeshit is costly so you go moderate on disc. Then u need extra turb
model.  My Reynolds is >1000000..? Sheeeeet

F--ing turbulence..

"France differs from the other European Union countries because it has
sovereignty interests in the region. More than 1.6 million French
citizens live in overseas territories there, and three-quarters of the
country’s exclusive economic zone — the second largest in the world —
is located there as well. France is not a spectator in the
Indo-Pacific, it is a resident power. Because of that, Australia will
remain a key partner in the South Pacific. Tensions may spike in the
short term, but the strategic partnership between the two countries
will endure"

"Deconstructing the administrative state".. Words like that should
freak everyone the f--k out. Until an alternative system arrives,
deconstructing what you have now is insane.. The world these muckers
envison would have low income ppl lose gov programs, see cuts to
social assistance, healthcare where you would have to ride a modified
exercise bike 12 hrs a day turning a pedal to mine bitcoins so you can
pay for your rent. Your small apt would be in a complex owned by the
oligapolies of the very cobsuckers that are asking for the said
deconstruction and inequality would run amok. You get sick?  No
problem: just inject diswasher liquid, eat chalk powder, you'll be
fine.. "You'll know what to do". 

Noone should actively seek for such a state of dysfunction, dystopia.

"The ambitions of [the Paypal mafia] have often gone hand in hand with
Thiel’s extremist libertarian political project: a reorganization of
civilization that would shift power from traditional
institutions—e.g., mainstream media, democratically elected
legislatures—toward startups and the billionaires who control
them. Thiel secretly funded the lawsuit that destroyed Gawker Media in
2016...

For Trump’s science adviser, Thiel suggested two climate change
deniers, Princeton physicist William Happer and Yale computer
scientist David Gelernter. For the head of the Food and Drug
Administration, Thiel offered, among other names, Balaji Srinivasan,
an entrepreneur with no obvious experience in government, who seemed
skeptical that the FDA should exist at all...

It’s illegal to use a Roth account to buy stock in a company you
control. And yet, starting in 1999, Thiel used a Roth to buy stock in
companies with which he was closely associated—including PayPal and
Palantir—for prices that were as low as a thousandth of a penny per
share. All the capital gains since then have been tax-free...

According to IRS rules, if a Roth IRA account holder engages in a
prohibited transaction—like using the money to invest in a company you
legally control—then that person loses the tax break for the entirety
of the portfolio’s value. In Thiel’s case that would mean he could be
on the hook for a tax bill in the billions"

"@alexchaomander

[..R]elabeling 'pretrained language models' as foundation models is
misleading and ultimately detrimental to the foundations that AI
needs. If we don't understand how these models work, why call them
foundation models at all?"

At its height Jerry Springer's show was beating Oprah; and all they
did was fight.. Such pure trash.

---

*The Jerry Springer Show*, *American Idol* were definitely the
stepping stones to the eventual *Hunger Games*. If you think about it,
there is a connection.

---

The single-party, Washingon Consensus was so bad around 90s that
Clinton could govern as a Southern Ronald Reagan, and Dubya could
govern as Republican Bill Clinton. Then of course everybody is
invading somewhere, deregulating, making government "small". What do
you have left to do politics over? Enter the culture war.

The mask was not iron.. ? The movie with that name was based on a lie!
How could that be! 

Wiki: "The Man in the Iron Mask [of France]... was an unidentified
prisoner who was arrested in 1669 or 1670... No one is known to have
seen his face, as it was hidden by a mask of black velvet cloth, later
misreported by Voltaire as an iron mask"

Gold is such a useless thing. Plus its mining is toxic as hell. Its
use should be discouraged, as jewelry, as a commodity, certainly as a

Osprey aircraft uses tiltrotor tech, very unstable. In recent scifi we
start seeing more and more quadcopter like aircraft, but these are
unstable constructions. Forward thrust, glide are more stable, or
helicopter tech. It takes extreme amt of processing to keep a
quadcopter aloft, as every hobbyst knows.

Once again, tech looks shiny, but not robust.

Remember RR, this is the guy who waved a gun around on the big screen
for a living, then he was *shot* by a real gun, in real life. Also the
founder of modern conservatism.. I think he knew what he was talking
about.

"But guns are a natural con issue". ?? Ronald Reagan was for gun
control.

---

The rules of the culture war is that it is fought on moral, or stupid,
and usually deadlocked issues where there isn't much movement either
way. That works great, bcz then each side can jump up and down, and
galvanize "their base" wout causing much change, eg guns issue (until
it became seriously serious).. Or the climate.

The Atlantic: "Republican Party leaders and conservative intellectuals
haven’t been trumpeting the Supreme Court’s decision to allow a Texas
ban on abortions to go forward"

Never liked that general area, downtown.. Must have been the overt

One office building I worked at in NYC was very close to Zuccotti
