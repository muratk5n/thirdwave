BREAKING NEWS: House Democrats announce plans to end Trump‚Äôs tax
giveaway to billionaires and corporations by raising taxes on

and people who make over $5 million a year"

It's sad how derivative things are in China. US started talking about
anti-trust, CH copies it. There is US judgement on external links from
Apple Store, similar issues are talked about in China. Why didn't you
think of this shit before, on your own?

At its height Jerry Springer's show was beating Oprah; and all they
did was fight.. Such pure trash.

---

*The Jerry Springer Show*, *American Idol* were definitely the
stepping stones to the eventual *Hunger Games*. If you think about it,
there is a connection.

---

The single-party, Washingon Consensus was so bad around 90s that
Clinton could govern as a Southern Ronald Reagan, and Dubya could
govern as Republican Bill Clinton. Then of course everybody is
invading somewhere, deregulating, making government "small". What do
you have left to do politics over? Enter the culture war.

Iron production plant in Russia, had 700 workers, now 100. Even the
crudest automation can eliminate people. \#3W

The mask was not iron.. ? The movie with that name was based on a lie!
How could that be! 

Wiki: "The Man in the Iron Mask [of France]... was an unidentified
prisoner who was arrested in 1669 or 1670... No one is known to have
seen his face, as it was hidden by a mask of black velvet cloth, later
misreported by Voltaire as an iron mask"

Gold is such a useless thing. Plus its mining is toxic as hell. Its
use should be discouraged, as jewelry, as a commodity, certainly as a
"store of value".

from Johannesburg‚Äôs omnipresent gold industry may be ruining the
health of nearby residents"

How to write lines for Sam Jackson? Basically think of stuff that
could come before a .. comma motherfucker.. Like you could think of
"is the sun coming up?" line by thinking of "is the sun coming up,
motherfucker?", then just dropping the last word.

Though not listed as an official base S. Korean Jeju island can host
US mil in a gif, they frequently get US sub and aircraft carrier

Osprey aircraft uses tiltrotor tech, very unstable. In recent scifi we
start seeing more and more quadcopter like aircraft, but these are
unstable constructions. Forward thrust, glide are more stable, or
helicopter tech. It takes extreme amt of processing to keep a
quadcopter aloft, as every hobbyst knows.

Once again, tech looks shiny, but not robust.

*Pandorum*, 2009, was ok.. Nice ending

Remember RR, this is the guy who waved a gun around on the big screen
for a living, then he was *shot* by a real gun, in real life. Also the
founder of modern conservatism.. I think he knew what he was talking
about.

---

"But guns are a natural con issue". ?? Ronald Reagan was for gun
control.

---

The rules of the culture war is that it is fought on moral, or stupid,
and usually deadlocked issues where there isn't much movement either
way. That works great, bcz then each side can jump up and down, and
galvanize "their base" wout causing much change, eg guns issue (until
it became seriously serious).. Or the climate.

The Atlantic: "Republican Party leaders and conservative intellectuals
haven‚Äôt been trumpeting the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to allow a Texas
ban on abortions to go forward"

Never liked that general area, downtown.. Must have been the overt
finance-vibe.

One office building I worked at in NYC was very close to Zuccotti
Park, basically Ground Zero, few years before 9/11. I wasnt there
during the attack, was near midtown, different company, but still in
NYC.

20 years.. Wow
