Darpa funded the first mRNA tech in 2013 - the basis of today's
Moderna and Pfizer vax

I have to say this is a fantastic application of mathematics to a
real-world problem. Based on two numbers the formula generates
near accurate counts for the entire grid structure. V cool.

Poisson distr is,

$$ f(x) = P(X=x) = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!} $$

which gives probability of 1 event, 2 events, in a certain block of
time. But in geo you have to think little differently. You divide
London into grids, and count how many bombs fell on each, then count
how many grids had 1 bomb, 2 bombs, etc. Reproducing such counts from
formula,

```python
N = 576.
m = 537/N
c = N*np.exp(-m)
expb = [c*1, c*m, c*m**2/2, c*(m**3)/(3*2)]
[np.round(e,2) for e in expb]
```

```text
Out[1]: [226.74, 211.39, 98.54, 30.62]
```

Real counts were 229, 211, 93, 35, etc. Pretty close. I am sure a
statistical test wld agree. Clustering disproved.

Why the Poisson distribution usage in this [post](2021/08/bermuda.md)?
Event counts tend to be distributed that way.. Let's take the London
bombing [example](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-institute-of-actuaries/article/abs/an-application-of-the-poisson-distribution/F75111847FDA534103BD4941BD96A78E).
They were wondering if bombings were clustering at specific places.
Cld be important.. Maybe Nazis were focusing bombing somewhere? Poisson
is for natural counts, then if that is proven, clustering is disproved.

Maybe they are Israelis from America. Their great-great-great
grandfather was kicked out by a Palestenian's great-great-great
grandfather, and, like, now they are totally back. ðŸ¤£

US teenagers there..? "Like, totally, a game changer, I liked eeiiiit"

Laboratory grown meat served in a restaurant (they grow the meat right
next door actually), Israel.

reshaping corporate America"

"An ecologically minded experiment to make Paris a cycling capital of
Europe has led to a million people now pedaling daily â€” and to rising
tensions with pedestrians."
