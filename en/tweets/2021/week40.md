If all lithium on Earth was mined and turned into batteries, it could
only handle 10% of todays energy requirements. H2, ammonia storage can
provide limitless storage capacity.

"The most worrisome factor is that China's delay might reflect not a
holdup in the preparation of its NDC, but a well-rehearsed plan to
leverage its climate change commitments into other areas where the
Biden administration has increased pressure on Beijing...

First, the weaponization of climate change measures might be seen by
the Biden administration as cutting off the last possibility of
cooperation with China, making the bilateral relationship much more
hostile. This is also a possibility in the case of Europe, given the
increasing importance of climate change in European citizens'
priorities"

Eastern Europeans, they sided with US, snubbed. And now the AU "sub

There was a manager at DARPA in 2013 who took a chance on mRNA tech;
lined up bunch of research deps for that goal... Who is that guy?
What is his background? In which setting could he do what he did?

---

Private companies are good for delivering end-products based on
existing research. But pushing for risky research, not the right
address. I look at all the inno originating from DARPA.. They funded,
managed so much.

JC was not a miscast! He was better than this new guy.. The key to
impressions is to catch a key characteristic. JC's angle is a
pent-up-anger shtick which of course reminds you of *Pet Detective*,
or *Liar Liar*, it was good.

TDB: "Last season, Saturday Night Live navigated its way through the
transition from Trump to Biden, first by miscasting Jim Carrey
opposite Alec Baldwin.. 47th season [opened w]ith one of its brand new
cast members, James Austin Johnson as the 46th president"

I have to say this is a fantastic application of mathematics to a
real-world problem. Based on two numbers the formula generates
near accurate counts for the entire grid structure. V cool.

---

Poisson distr is,

$$ f(x) = P(X=x) = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!} $$

which gives probability of 1 event, 2 events, in a certain block of
time. But in geo you have to think little differently. You divide
London into grids, and count how many bombs fell on each, then count
how many grids had 1 bomb, 2 bombs, etc. Reproducing such counts from
formula,

```python
N = 576.
m = 537/N
c = N*np.exp(-m)
expb = [c*1, c*m, c*m**2/2, c*(m**3)/(3*2)]
[np.round(e,2) for e in expb]
```

```text
Out[1]: [226.74, 211.39, 98.54, 30.62]
```

Real counts were 229, 211, 93, 35, etc. Pretty close. I am sure a
statistical test wld agree. Clustering disproved. 

---

Why the Poisson distribution usage in this [post](../../2021/08/bermuda.md)?
Event counts tend to be distributed that way.. Let's take the London
bombing [example](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-institute-of-actuaries/article/abs/an-application-of-the-poisson-distribution/F75111847FDA534103BD4941BD96A78E).
They were wondering if bombings were clustering at specific places.
Cld be important.. Maybe Nazis were focusing bombing somewhere? Poisson
is for natural counts, then if that is proven, clustering is disproved.
