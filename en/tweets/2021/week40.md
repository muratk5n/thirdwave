# Week 40

Asking a socmed company to decide themselves to not make something go
viral.. that's like asking McDonalds to sell less burgers.. Tough
ask. Can they determine when something has high DMSI but "can be
dangerous"? The answer is no, because the AI tasked with that job
doesn't work (she said this many times, it's true, even a lot of weak
AI is extremely shoddy). Good testimony though.. there was lots of
useful info in it.

"During the hearing, [Facebook whistleblower] Haugen mentioned that
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to not remove downstream MSI, or
Meaningful Social Interactions, because, rumor has it, peoples'
bonuses were tied to it. Haugen was formerly a product manager on
Facebook's civic integrity team, which focused on election
issues. Facebook got rid of her team shortly before the Jan. 6 riots,
and she quit her job in April.

The downstream MSI is a problematic tool because it predicts when
something might go viral ‚Äî get a lot of views, shares, and comments ‚Äî
and then it pushes that content out to more users"

Most companies cannot use, approach the DARPA model.. preferring an
actor-geek CEO instead, who will acquire, acqu-hire, or madly toss
together actually known tech in a bowl hoping something will come out
of it while trying to look "brave" in the process.

"The most worrisome factor is that China's delay might reflect not a
holdup in the preparation of its NDC, but a well-rehearsed plan to
leverage its climate change commitments into other areas where the
Biden administration has increased pressure on Beijing...

First, the weaponization of climate change measures might be seen by
the Biden administration as cutting off the last possibility of
cooperation with China, making the bilateral relationship much more
hostile. This is also a possibility in the case of Europe, given the
increasing importance of climate change in European citizens'
priorities"

There was a manager at DARPA in 2013 who took a chance on mRNA tech;
lined up bunch of research deps for that goal... Who is that guy?
What is his background? In which setting could he do what he did?

Private companies are good for delivering end-products based on
existing research. But pushing for risky research, not the right
address. I look at all the inno originating from DARPA.. They funded,
managed so much.

JC was not a miscast! He was better than this new guy.. The key to
impressions is to catch a key characteristic. JC's angle is a
pent-up-anger shtick which of course reminds you of *Pet Detective*,
or *Liar Liar*, it was good.

I have to say this is a fantastic application of mathematics to a
real-world problem. Based on two numbers the formula generates
near accurate counts for the entire grid structure. V cool.

---

Poisson distr is,

$$ f(x) = P(X=x) = e^{-\lambda}\frac{\lambda^{x}}{x!} $$

which gives probability of 1 event, 2 events, in a certain block of
time. But in geo you have to think little differently. You divide
London into grids, and count how many bombs fell on each, then count
how many grids had 1 bomb, 2 bombs, etc. Reproducing such counts from
formula,

```python
N = 576.
m = 537/N
c = N*np.exp(-m)
expb = [c*1, c*m, c*m**2/2, c*(m**3)/(3*2)]
[np.round(e,2) for e in expb]
```

```text
Out[1]: [226.74, 211.39, 98.54, 30.62]
```

Real counts were 229, 211, 93, 35, etc. Pretty close. I am sure a
statistical test wld agree. Clustering disproved. 

---

Why the Poisson distribution usage in this [post](../../2021/08/bermuda.md)?
Event counts tend to be distributed that way.. Let's take the London
bombing [example](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-institute-of-actuaries/article/abs/an-application-of-the-poisson-distribution/F75111847FDA534103BD4941BD96A78E).
They were wondering if bombings were clustering at specific places.
Cld be important.. Maybe Nazis were focusing bombing somewhere? Poisson
is for natural counts, then if that is proven, clustering is disproved.
