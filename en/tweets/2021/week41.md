Down with the suit

"@TeleFashion

NecktieSuit sales are in decline. 

Even before Covid, major companies were relaxing their policy on
wearing suits to the office.

Now, the pandemic has driven another nail into the coffin"

2011/12 was the peak, absolute bloddy worst, worst of times.. This is
the year of Occuppy Wall Street BTW (the Zuccotti Park again), shortly
before the *Pope* started jumping up and down on inequality, and
Pikketty book was published on the same theme.

Another book incorrectly analyzing why countries make war, lacking
numerical analysis - *The Tragedy of Great Power Politics* by
Mearsheimer. Just as "balance of power" analysis' are insufficient, so
is "maximizing power for safety".  Every decision a leader makes is
influenced by nominal selectorate, the real selectorate, and the
winning coalition. The size of each of these groups
[determine](2015/04/dictators-handbook-mesquita.md#war) the war/piece
decision.

It sounds like if you disprove Kirchoff's Law, and truly make that

Less than a billion ppl live in Southern Hemisphere, most are in the
North. That's why their (our) winter matters more, and why we can
suspect heating for [this](2015/08/temp-increase.md#carbon) type of
seasonal increase.

Platinum used in fuel-cells are highly recyclable (same report) plus
less of it is needed to make FCs work. Also you are committing to a
simple base chemistry as an energy carrier, further inno around 
which is easier; eg there are solid-oxide FCs for stationary use.

---

World Bank Report: "[S]ome recycling processes cause losses in the
material itself and it may not be technically or economically feasible
to recover material suitable for recycling from some
applications. This is especially the case now with Li-ion batteries
helping explain the low recycling rates for lithium [less than 1%]"

How much debt is enough? It [varies](../../2020/07/austerity.md) from country

After Azeris took Karabakh region w TR help, Iranians suspected Israel,
and US motives behind it. Then TR-Paki-Azeri joint military drill
happened, then the Azeri tax on the Iranian trucks passing through
Karabakh. That road was apparenly a major trade route for the
Iranians, which the Azeris captured. Then Iran did exercise near AZ.

The situation can escalate to a proxy war, involving all the parties
listed. Maybe the war would be preferred by the US planners, Iran gave
US a hard time in Iraq, this wld be the payback, possibly leading to
toppling of Iranian regime, and completing the bigger plan triggered
by the invasion of Iraq. Dont care abt the f-ing mullahs but cld be
problematic for my tigger. Homie can barely take care itself as
it is.

"Iranâ€™s military has launched a large military drill near the countryâ€™s
border with Azerbaijan, in a show of force amid tensions with its
neighbouring country partly linked to the latterâ€™s close ties with
Israel...

Iran is also concerned about the presence of fighters that Azerbaijan
brought in during last yearâ€™s fighting over the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh.

Tensions between the two neighbours also rose after Azerbaijan imposed
a 'road tax' on Iranian trucks moving through the Karabakh region, and
detained two Iranian lorry drivers last month"

German FDP is also pro-green. But US's corrupt liberterians, including
Focker himself are actively [undermining](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-15/peter-thiel-gamed-silicon-valley-tech-trump-taxes-and-politics)
the green agenda. R U in the ðŸ‘Œ circle of trust, Focker?

---

FDP could be considered Germany's liberterians. Their positions are,
no surprise, liberty-centric.. In US though, a lot of "free-market
leaning purists", especially the ones visible in the media (thanks to
that shady Thiel money) approach the issue differently. They must be
there to help the single-party rule to persist by providing
semi-intellectual cover for the culture war.

DW: "[DE has a] prohibition on doctors advertising pregnancy
terminations .. [The] Free Democrats (FDP), which emphasizes
individual civil liberties, put forward a resolution to repeal [it]
entirely"
