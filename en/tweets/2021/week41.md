How much debt is enough? It [varies](2020/07/austerity.md) from country
to country. In the absence of clear economic thresholds, politics will decide,
one side can be for 60% the other 120%, ending up at 90%.

Knocker-upper.. that used to be a job.

Hopefully 'teaching' follows the same fate.

After Azeris took Karabakh region w TR help, Iranians suspected Israel,
and US motives behind it. Then TR-Paki-Azeri joint military drill
happened, then the Azeri tax on the Iranian trucks passing through
Karabakh. That road was apparenly a major trade route for the
Iranians, which the Azeris captured. Then Iran did exercise near AZ.

The situation can escalate to a proxy war, involving all the parties
listed. Maybe the war would be preferred by the US planners, Iran gave
US a hard time in Iraq, this wld be the payback, possibly leading to
toppling of Iranian regime, and completing the bigger plan triggered
by the invasion of Iraq. Dont care abt the f-ing mullahs but cld be
problematic for my tigger. Homie can barely take care itself as
it is.

"Iranâ€™s military has launched a large military drill near the countryâ€™s
border with Azerbaijan, in a show of force amid tensions with its
neighbouring country partly linked to the latterâ€™s close ties with
Israel...

Iran is also concerned about the presence of fighters that Azerbaijan
brought in during last yearâ€™s fighting over the disputed region of
Nagorno-Karabakh.

Tensions between the two neighbours also rose after Azerbaijan imposed
a 'road tax' on Iranian trucks moving through the Karabakh region, and
detained two Iranian lorry drivers last month"

German FDP is also pro-green. But US's corrupt liberterians, including
Focker himself are actively [undermining](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-15/peter-thiel-gamed-silicon-valley-tech-trump-taxes-and-politics)
the green agenda. R U in the ðŸ‘Œ circle of trust, Focker?

FDP could be considered Germany's liberterians. Their positions are,
no surprise, liberty-centric.. In US though, a lot of "free-market
leaning purists", especially the ones visible in the media (thanks to
that shady Thiel money) approach the issue differently. They must be
there to help the single-party rule to persist by providing
semi-intellectual cover for the culture war.

DW: "[DE has a] prohibition on doctors advertising pregnancy
terminations .. [The] Free Democrats (FDP), which emphasizes
individual civil liberties, put forward a resolution to repeal [it]
entirely"
