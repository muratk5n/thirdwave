.. on **some** issues. This is key. They did not go haywire on
everything bcz on pro-corp, cartel politics they agree.

The issues they went further right have certain characteristic - stuff
that used to be secondary, easy-to-agree-on issues, like guns, now is
not. Reagan was pro-gun control (this is the guy who made money
holding a gun and shooting people on screen for entertainment
remember), but now no Rep will touch it. Or the issue have been mostly
decided and safely out of legislative harms way, like abortion. SCOTUS
dropped the hammer in 1973 and abortion became legal, hence this
"issue-non-issue" is now something u can safely jump up and down
about, "differentiating" youself, wout causing undue damage (surely u
can hem and haw and cut from this corner, that corner, but still, it
is mostly decided).

Ironically some of the issue-non-issues now became real issues because
of neglect - that's what you get for faux divisions - even tiny
problems can grow and metastasize.

I'd look at the experience of Postmodernists - they started with the
QM Uncertainty Principle and now they are in lala land,
ultra-subjective, and worse, anti-science.

---

I wouldn't base any philosophy on Bohr; his science is basically a
lack of one (which some modern day weirdos turned into an accepted
absurdism, extreme relativism). Philosophy and hard sciences are
intertwined, and if philosophers follow these effers they'll fall off
a cliff never to come back. Watch out.

---

Yeah - this is exactly a fitting response from the founder of Quantum
Mechanics. It "works", let's not care about the deeper issues. He
probably used that horseshoe to make exactly that point, as a
gag. Let's not forget there were huge fights about QM and its lack of
ontology back in the day, and Bohr was fighting for hearts and
minds. They won, but even tho a majority of scientists have been fed
the morphine and cannot think clearly anymore, a few brains still
continue to do so.

"When a friend saw a horseshoe over the door of Bohr's country cabin,
he said in mock astonishment, 'Surely you don't believe in that old
superstition!' 'No,' said Bohr, 'but they say it works even if you
don't believe in it.'"

---

True. It can't say "how that exists", it just an algorithmic approach
that currently explains the data well. Like, by looking at the result
of division, say coming out of an "experiment", they saw (2,2) then 1,
then saw (6,3) and 2, they sort of discovered long division, bcz it
works well. It is perfectly good algorithm, and it certainly explains
a certain aspect, but are not interested in and have no idea on number
theory, sets, or functions.

Also see a theory of [shadows](../../2019/08/smolin.md).

I think this guy has a problem being part of stuff. Maybe that's where
his Brexitism largely comes from. I mean at a personal level that's
fine, be a loner whatever, but at a nation-scale?

People don't understand, the EU is already a skeletal and *very*
nation centric method of having a union. When I was in Germany my
Deutsche Bank card wouldn't even work in Netherland banks. Not a
single one. What integration?- This is the least amount of
togetherness that is tolerable for Europeans that can project some
kind of power and keeps the trade going. That's it.

And all this avenue of research contributed to SU(5) which led
nowhere.

IDT the holy grail is around symmetry breaking.

Any effort that revolves around this concept will be ignored by
mua. If I was handling a grant awarding process, symmetry breaking
would get no money. String Theory, no money. Multiverse, no money.

"A common example from physics is of a pencil balanced on its
point. It is symmetric, in that while it is balanced on its point, one
direction is as good as another. But it is unstable. When the pencil
falls, as it inevitably must, it will fall randomly, in one direction
or another, breaking the symmetry. Once it has fallen, it is stable,
but it no longer manifests the symmetry‚Äîalthough the symmetry is still
there in the underlying laws. The laws describe only the space of what
possibly may happen; the actual world governed by those laws involves
a choice of one realization from many possibilities.  This mechanism
of spontaneous symmetry breaking can happen to the symmetries between
the particles in nature. When it occurs for the symmetries that, by
the gauge principle, give rise to the forces of nature, it leads to
the differences in their properties." -- Smolin, *Trouble with
Physics*

"Each block in an account-chain also contains the account-chain‚Äôs
balance, meaning that one only has to store the latest block and not
one‚Äôs entire transaction history of blocks (let alone that of the
entire network). This lets users use Nano without having to download
transaction histories that are monstrous in size (e.g. Bitcoin‚Äôs
blockchain is ~250 gigabytes in size, as of writing).

As long as the NANO in all account-chains adds up to the NANO balance
in Nano‚Äôs genesis account-chain, which initially contained all NANO,
users can be sure that there isn‚Äôt anything suspicious going on, like
counterfeiting of NANO.

To make sure that this is the case, each Nano account-chain chooses a
Representative to vote on the validity of Nano transactions. Each
Representative‚Äôs voting weight is the sum of all account-chain NANO
balances delegated to it. Since blocks are incredibly small in size,
Representatives are able to confirm transactions near instantaneously.

Another thing to note is that since there is no race between miners to
add blocks, or groups of transactions, to the blockchain in order to
win a block reward, as with networks like Bitcoin, the Nano network
uses barely any energy to stay running"

"Today, Google has eight products with more than a billion users
apiece. It knows what you think through its much larger ‚Äúdatabase of
intentions.' It knows where you go in the physical world through its
two billion constantly roaming Android phones and its mobile ad app
and Google Maps subsidiaries. It knows where you go online through its
tracking businesses, and it has information about business ad
campaigns through its advertising technology subsidiaries. This
provides Google with a God‚Äôs-eye view of behavior. Married to this
surveillance power is the ability to organize the distribution of
information through YouTube, Google Maps, Google search, email, and
its own popular browser. As Schmidt put it, 'We know where you are. We
know where you‚Äôve been. We can more or less know what you‚Äôre thinking
about.'

Google, Amazon, and Facebook are conglomerates who monopolize ad
markets, and have done so through a range of tactics and mergers that
were until very recently illegal. And in doing so, they have become
governing powers. Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, put it this
way. 'In a lot of ways,' he said, 'Facebook is more like a government
than a traditional company. We have this large community of people,
and more than other technology companies we‚Äôre really setting
policies.'" -- Stoller, *Goliath*

"While this predominant type of lithium extraction [as in LatAm]
requires big up-front investments of capital and expertise, the whole
process is less labor intensive than digging up coal or oil. Yet it
requires massive amounts of water in some of the driest places on
earth, with single companies using as much as 1,700 litres per
second. This drain has disrupted ecosystems around the lakes and cut
off freshwater access for indigenous communities in the so-called
lithium triangle countries of Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile"

IBM did all that? I thought it was bunch of rabid libertards in a
garage..

"In 1980, IBM, wary of being accused of controlling the personal
computer business, signed a ‚Äãdeal with Microsoft to produce an
operating system‚Äîknown as DOS‚Äîfor its personal computer, and
standardized its PC chips on Intel. IBM then transferred enormous
programming and technical know-how to both companies, and even
protected Intel throughout the 1980s from Japanese competition"

So the aging Ginsburg is no "bulwark" against anything, against Trump,
whatever. Maybe it is good she is on her way out, no? With the right
lens lota heroes become zeros.

"Clinton also appointed pro-monopoly judges. When Clinton appointed
Supreme Court justices, he picked Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg. Both sailed through the Senate, not because of a tradition
of bipartisanship, but because neither worried powerful business
interests. Both were adherents of the same basic monopoly-friendly
philosophy promoted by the Chicago School. And once on the bench, in
2004, both signed one of the most pro-monopoly opinions in the ‚Äãhistory
of the court, one authored by Antonin Scalia. ‚ÄúThe mere possession of
monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is
not only not unlawful,‚Äù said the court, ‚Äúit is an important element of
the free-market system"  -- Stoller, *Goliath*

"As a candidate, Clinton‚Äôs Democratic platform called for a
'Revolution of 1992', capturing the anger of the moment. But the
platform was written by Al From, and for the first time since 1880
there was no mention of antitrust or corporate power, despite a decade
with the worst financial manipulation America had seen since the
1920s. This revolution would be against government, in government,
around government.

When Clinton took office, the Democrats finally had a majority in the
House, a majority in the Senate, and the presidency. Clinton not only
entrenched Reagan‚Äôs antitrust principles into the DOJ by making them
bipartisan, but expanded the Reagan revolution more broadly. With the
end of the Cold War, Clinton took neoliberalism global"  -- Stoller, *Goliath*

Bill Bradley. The "challenger" "from the left" against Al Gore during
99 primary.. Those were the days...

"New Democrats saw cooperation between business and government as a
compelling alternative to Reaganism, and as a means of addressing
international financial problems. Thurow had drawn from Galbraith, who
in turn had drawn directly from such Bull Moose thinkers as Walter
Lippmann.

Like Teddy Roosevelt and Galbraith, Thurow preached the abolition of
the antitrust laws. All used the same excuse for doing so. ‚ÄúIn markets
where international trade exists or could exist, national antitrust
laws no longer make sense,‚Äù wrote Thurow. This was a direct echo of
TR‚Äôs statement, in accepting the Bull Moose nomination in 1912, that
if we ‚Äúdo not allow cooperation, we shall be defeated in the world‚Äôs
markets.‚Äù As Rothenberg pointed out, Bill Bradley, Gary Hart, and Paul
Tsongas made the same argument, all proposing to relax antitrust and
banking laws" -- Stoller, *Goliath*

Barney Frank too...? The Frank of Dodd-Frank? Sad.

G. Stephanaopopololopopous got his start under Gephart. GS says that
later in his career "leftists" like him felt stabbed in the back when
Clint said "the era of big gov is over". I guess the surprising thing

"A young operative named Al From organized the political operation of
the New Democrats. From had worked in the Carter White House. After
the Carter debacle, an old Louisiana politician, Gillis Long,
recruited From to run the House Democratic Caucus, and they put
together something called the ‚ÄúCommittee on Party Effectiveness‚Äù to
bring fresh ideas into the party. This forum included many of the key

"Much of Wall Street got involved, directly or indirectly, with
Milken‚Äôs network. Robert Rubin, who later became the treasury
