Not much life left in Beto, and most other up-starts. Boot-Edge-Edge

Bernie, Warren doing well. The race is shaping up.

If it comes down to Kamala vs Warren, which one? I'll go for more
un-Trumpness (non-white, female). K is also younger, with more
energy. Not bad lookin either..

BTW there is no link btw this so-called Euro right and austerity. Victor Orban happily applied it, and it worked for him.

"In Italy, for instance, few days go by without Matteo Salvini, the country‚Äôs right-wing populist interior minister and the man widely seen as a leader-in-waiting, saying that Italy doesn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúmeet the same fate as Greece.‚Äù In Salvini‚Äôs rhetoric, winding up like Greece means ceding national sovereignty to the baddies of the European Union, who in turn would impose an emasculating austerity regime on Italy."

This is second time I read a feral attack on a pub official, and it
was extremely unjustified. One TR (Babacan), and one for ECB (Lagarde
4 her IMF days). I remember Lag asked for Greece debt forgiveness more
than once. She was portrayed very badly. Babacan is blamed? for saying
2011-12 dollar flood can reverse (which did). What r these ppl
smoking?

An engineering college must teach solving, computing the double
pendulum. U get into Lagrangians, then Euler-Lagrange (what's that?
generalized calculus of variations), then numerical solution of system
of ODEs. This one prob gives you all.

He is right. His teacher taught him well :) His thesis advisor was
Huntington, of *Clash of Civilization* fame. Great book (ignoring the
grim parts) Huntin's main thesis is religion matters, and Protestanism

already a place for you in the Americas, like Brasil, Argentina,

Rapaille's The Culture Code + Abramovitz's Time for Change explains
all you need to know on the electorate.

Rapaille, reptilian (survival) and emotional (culture) rule everything
else. Intellect comes last. This is science.

Abramovitz: a vague popularity, incumbency and econ effects vote.

It's all jumbled images. For a black vote, Biden was VP, of a black
president. Voter: "I be black, Biden good". Now Kamala attacks, a
black person with formerly high office, on a black issue, "he is
disrespecting him, so maybe Biden does not deserve such respect. Biden
be not good".

(for whites it'd be the same thing obviously)

Nuke is the kind of solution you propose when u want to come across as

I wonder why Gore is so dead-set against CCS. I believe he is worried CCS will be used to lengthen the life of fossils. He is for a "final solution". That's fine - so am I.

---

One of my worries (could be nothing) on CCS was if u suck air in with a machine for carbon removal, could you get to all air, lots of air? Or would you just get the same air around you within a certain distance that just keeps circulating over and over? Probably not but one wonders...

Right; Euler-Lagrange eqn is a generalized formula for certain Calculus of Variation problems. No need to go through all the plug-and-chug, E-L already did that for general enough vars, u just subtitute and voila! Mary Boas makes the point well. The book is legendary.

He's got that all wrong. Banks print money while giving credit, no
need for "savings". If u print money for speculation, that creates
bubbles. If comps are not overlevered, they are not blocked in their
inno, they go get credit and produce "good growth".

"Summers: [T]his may all be madness, and I may not have this right at all.‚Äù But in light of the data, the question had to be put: What if the inadequate recovery was not simply down to policy failure? What if there was a deeper problem, a chronic shortfall in the demand for investment relative to the supply of savings, resulting in a sustained condition of ‚Äúsecular stagnation‚Äù?
			
To see the force of this argument, Summers invited his surprised audience to look back to the period before the crash. In retrospect, everyone agreed that monetary policy before 2008 had been ‚Äútoo easy.¬†.¬†.¬†. [T]here was a vast amount of imprudent lending going on. Almost everybody believes that wealth, as it was experienced by households, was in excess of its reality. Too easy money, too much borrowing, too much wealth.‚Äù But if that were the case, one would have expected the American economy to have been on a dramatic bull run. It was not. Despite the excesses of the housing boom, growth up to 2008 had been average" *Crashed*

*Crashed* 

"One of the side effects of Bernanke‚Äôs QE policy of low interest rates
was that it made it hugely attractive for companies to borrow to buy
out their competitors. In three giant merger waves, cresting in 2000,
2006 and 2015, with the antitrust authorities looking on, American
capitalism remade itself in a more concentrated and monopolistic
mode."

Trump does have thick skin... A convervative pundit once described him

Some try to argue the oppo bcz they want to sound PC. Dont do
that. Look at the data.

"There are good reasons why, even in Democratic presidential primary
campaigns, large majorities of black voters do end up supporting the
same candidate.Political solidarity is not an innate characteristic of
black America; it is a survival tactic that adverse experience has
reinforced time and time again. Chattel slavery and Jim Crow paid
little mind to the specific talents, abilities, and aspirations of
each black person. Simply being a member of the race was sufficient to
be disenfranchised and oppressed. Black Americans have been made
acutely aware that their individual fates are linked to the wellbeing
of the whole group"

I thought abt this the other day; elec cars really suck if u run out
of battery too. If u run out of gas u can bring little gas, petro,

"South African telecoms companies are hit by higher operating costs
whenever load-shedding strikes. GenCell CEO Rami Reshef has argued
that using hydrogen as a backup energy solution has the potential to
greatly reduce the impact.

The company uses technology to generate hydrogen cheaply from
ammonia. Reshef says that the price of ammonia is half or even a third
of the equivalent weight of diesel, and that a business could use his
solution to have enough power for several days. A report published by
Rethink Technology and GenCell in 2018 estimated that a mobile
operator in South Africa implementing the GenCell backup product on
1,000 of its sites could save $200m over ten years compared with
diesel. Reshef says he is in negotiations with several mobile
operators in South Africa."
