Damn, Vonnegut was a POW at Dresden, luckily jailed in a safe place while UK fire bombed the place. He came out, Dresden was gone. "It was like the surface of the moon" he said later. >20 ppl killed.

It's funny SV ppl are the types who want to deal _least_ with people
somehow ended up dealing w them the most. Ethics, speech, privacy,
etc. Social nets really broke the camel's back.

You are up in ppl's biznitch, then gov will be up in yours - cuz gov's
biznitch is people.

A lot of times non coder types look for neferiousness in Net
platforms. I guarantee u, what they do most of the time is trying to
reduce their involvement. Dude is flagged for sharing gif, wouldnt it
be better to warn first?

Yes but they could use human reward / punish cycle to reduce their
involvement (involvement is so non-code and not cool). If u flag and
punish, only real non-offenders are motivated to fight back (legally
what-not). That's fine for them.

"Just 5 nuclear plants in Pennsylvania (PA) produce
 
- more electricity than *all* the solar in US

- 93% of PAâ€™s clean power
- 4,500 high-paying jobs"
