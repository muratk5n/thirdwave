\#China is ending an old era of subsidizing BEV’s and beginning a new
one in #hydrogen #fuelcell EV’s.

Why is China choosing hydrogen over #Tesla? Potential.  #H2 can be
generated domestically, distributed, and retailed at price parity to
fossil fuels"

PMQ sounds surreal. PM talks abt things done, decisions reached with a tone as if they werent stupidest f--ing things to begin with. Is this how second wave truly ends?

It's like the mannerism of best speech dubbed with the words of Chris Rock's standup routine. "Do you want your salad tossed?". "Yes I want my salad tossed very much". 

Imagine it delivered with May's voice. That is how PMQ sounds like to me. It's comedy.

I thought capitalist want ppl 'not to sit on their ass and work'. People w wealth, especially inherited wealth, do exactly that. If u tax wealth, like real estate just sitting there appreciating collecting rent, that would incentivize work, right?

'But the rich worked to get there then w wealth they can rest'. The poor works too, then more, then more. When do they get a rest?

'But the poor does not know what to work on, work smart'. Look, there is a reason why we instintively deny such thought. We have the genes of ppl who survived the harshest race ever. We know, deep down, the current 'game' is made up, artificial.

Maybe if this artificial game lasted long enough it would select its own genetic survivors, but each game is stupider, shorter than the last. 50k years of agrarian era now gone. Then industrial, 300 yrs gone. So now, what, everyone is an office monkey sitting at a desk? Nah.

Anyone who is interested in space can easily satisfy their curiosity exploring under the sea. It will be cheaper, and I guarantee it, it's a freak show down there, both good and bad.

U float, as in space, check. It is vast, check. Diff is u can come up for air once in a while.

.. movement is 3D check. 

It'd be fun to work on sensor / nav control of a sub. Air liquification, energy storage, a lot of interesting science if 1 chooses the DIY route.

@GabriellBirkman

"In my first undergrad, I once spent two straight weeks on a physics problem that I ultimately solved. 

Bezos spent three hours on a PDE and gave up on physics."

Hilbert: "Every boy in the streets of Göttingen understands more about four-dimensional geometry than Einstein. Yet, in spite of that, Einstein did the work and not the mathematicians.”

It's not necessary to have that gun-slinging problem-cruncher ability that works equally well in every  subdomain. You hit those subdomains as needed. What's needed is the ability to model mathematically, to pose the right questions, and have a sense where to find the answers.

We've had decades of problem-crunchers, and physics is stuck. Multiverses, alt. universes sound imaginative and sexy but they are really not. Some1 dropped the ball way back and crunchers have been blindly toiling in that direction ever since.
