Telecom analogy is a start, but not perfect. They could break up

Load balancers distribute user traffic, before any major processing is
done. Major processing would be taking data, recommending friends,
etc. which are done by so-called "app servers". Load balancers are
banks of computers / switches that do basic routing before user gets
to app processing. Anti-trust can go in at this level, and do
enforcement on user sharing level.

[Data portability - Sen. Warner](https://youtu.be/43UQzOrM9Fk?t=24)

Is this guy serious? SocMed companies are more about relationships
than one person's data. I take my data, but I cannot take my friends
to another company. Advertising might care about that person's data,
but that person is there to be advertised to because of other users.

Then, it might be a good idea to force comps to share their entire
user graph, and the easiest way to do that would be to break them up,
same user should be able to login from FB1, FB2 and see their all
friends. Well maybe this is more of a cloning, than a break-up. Hell
distribute traffic from main domain name to either 1 or 2 to give the
second comp a headstart (e-z to implement at load-balancing or even
DNS level)... Then the third, fourth company would have an easier time
to join in.

The so-called "New Democrats" (which really mean good-ol Republicans)
probably went overboard in their anti-Russkieness to prove to everyone
they were just like Reps.. The way a born-again Christian is more
fervent believer than a regular Christian, they lost their marbs to
prove their security state credentials through this one issue?

A Republican would have nothing to prove, so they can go hard, they
can go soft - whatever. It is a well-known fact HW Bush tried to save
/ help the Soviet state until the last moment (who needs the extra
chaos?). But did the Clintons try too hard during 90s to kick the
Russians when they were already down?

"For five years, the ECB has applied negative interest rates on
commercial bank reserves, and commercial banks have paid ‚Ç¨21.4bn to it
in deposit interest. Since it introduced negative interest rates, it
has injected some ‚Ç¨2.7 trillion of base money into the Eurozone
economy, increasing M1, the narrower measure of the money quantity, by
61%. Almost all of it has supported the finances of Eurozone
governments.

The effect on broader money, which includes bank credit, has been to
increase M3 by 30%. Far from stimulation, this is daylight robbery
perpetrated on everyone‚Äôs liquidity and cash deposits. It is a tax on
the purchasing power of their wages.

The ECB is not alone. Since Lehman went under, the major central banks
have collectively increased their balance sheets from $7 trillion to
$19.4 trillion, an increase of 177%. Most of this monetary expansion
has been to buy government bonds, providing a money-fountain for
profligate governments. The purpose of money-printing is always to
finance government spending, not to stimulate or ease conditions for
the private sector: while some trusting souls in the system believe it
is for the latter, that amounts to just a myth."

Attempting to "merge" relativity and QM will not work - same
reason. They tried, with these extra dimensions, curling-up, splits,
joins, whatever.. all failed. QM and GR need to be manifestations of
something different, something deeper - a completely different
abstraction. No synthesis. No dialectic.

---

Hell some could build on the latter and say maybe some pol leaders had
div intervention. Story goes Abraham Lincoln used to sit up late at
night and stare outside for hours on end, like a crazy person. Maybe
he experienced some intervention.. ?

---

'Religion as left' does not say anything about divine intervention (or
superuser access to the ancestral simulation). Some could believe
religious leaders were smart, some could say they experienced
intervention and still end up doing the same things.

---

Huntingon said "the great political ideologies of the twentieth
century ... are products of [the West]. No other civilization has
generated a significant political ideology. The West, however, has
never generated a major religion". Great observation - but can be
debunked with religion *is* in fact ideology, and specifically, left
ideology (rooted in pre-agro, pre-village, pre-sheep).

Is dialectic used to reach this concl ? No. This is no "fusing",
"synthesis" btw two disparate things, it is falsification. *Destroy*
the idea of religion as known, then go to a different abstraction, and
say these two events, political ideology and religion, are actually
manifestation of the something else - a rebellion against inequality.

On healtcare spending Warr Buffy says "healthcare spending is already

"Vital innovation, Zuckerberg threatens, will only happen if you‚Äôre
nice enough to him and his rich friends.

As common as this argument is, it also happens not to be true. Take
the basis of Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs fortune. The internet was developed out
of a small Pentagon network intended to allow the military to exchange
information during the Cold War. In her book The Entrepreneurial
State, economist Mariana Mazzucato shows that iPhones ‚Äì the ones that
Facebook skims prolific amounts of data off of to sell to the highest
bidder ‚Äì are in large part a collection of technologies created by
various state agencies, cobbled together by Apple into the same sleek
case.

Instead of leading the way to improve health outcomes, the quest for
profits in medicine has led drug companies to produce products just
different enough from those of their competitors to patent,
effectively allowing these firms collect rent from the sick" - Aronoff

Clinton, *My Life*

>Center Point was a little place of fewer than two hundred people. The
black notebook said the man to see was Bo Reece, a longtime supporter
who lived in the best house in town. In the days before television
ads, there was a Bo Reece in most little Arkansas towns. A couple of
weeks before the election, people would ask, ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Bo for?‚Äù His
choice would be made known and would get about two- thirds of the
vote, sometimes more.

This dynamic still exists BTW, through media, Internet.

Does this mean ppl are even less skillful on politics than we thought?
They dont even chose a representative, they chose a thought leader who
choses a representative? Not necessarily.. they still chose a person
to follow, who they think knows about an issue more than they. That
also takes skill.

The great sin of the white-collar cognateriat = pretension... 

---

So since the crowd has no "wisdom", on the referandum they simply
reflected back the elite divison back to the elite, albeit with
somewhat of a tilt towards Brexit, because they lied better.

---

Another proof that issues are distant to people. He most likely was
regurgitating talking pts from a thought leader he follows.

This is why referandums are unnecessary. People already pick other ppl
to follow ideas of... No need to burden them any further on deciding
on the issues themselves. They have their work, specialty which I am
sure is challenging on its own, but different from government.

Here is the essence of the MAX debate. 

Let's say a car manufacturer made all their cars to go like this

<img width="400" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRKyTchZirRbzdDfMzugmGtrBw2qyomYZQu_mdfu4tInG52T4Vm"/>

Now this pose is unstable, too easy for car to fall to either side. So
the manufacturer says "I can fix that, we'll add software detecting
when a car is about to keel over, make a tiny correction immediately,
and keep the car on two wheels".

Fine but the system is still fragile. All this work is being done to
keep a car in an odd position.

Much better to have a car on four wheels and have no correction than
on two with huge amount of correction.

"Oh but we fixed the 737 MAX software"

to 400km. It can be refuelled with hydrogen pressurised at 350 bar in
under 9 minutes, and its only emissions are water vapour"

No - competing against Airbus is not enough. Then you get into that

Boeing as the sole aircraft supplier in US is hampering airlines,
after that MAX debacle, there is no alternative US supplier.

Side note: Clinton admin allowed the Boeing / McDonnel Douglas merger
that created this monopoly.

Bitch - the food I eat daily would blow your mind. I'll give you some
food, u take a bite, and you'll fall down and **die**. There'll be
convulsions.. shake.. shake. And a final one...  then freeze -
flatline. Your eyes will be wide-open throughout, when you finally
check out, they will still be open, as if wanting to take that one
last look at that mo..f..ka that just killed you. It's that good.

No she didn't do well.

"Did good" or "bad" all depends on the objective. [Dropping that oppo
like it's
hot](https://extranewsfeed.com/drop-that-oppo-like-its-hot-75d60783c6f1)
might not be a good criteria for debate perf. Trump's goal was not an
oppo fight. It was banking on Hillary's (un)likability. All I remember
from the debates some time later now is Trump looking down, constantly
shaking his head and saying "terrible woman... terrible woman", an
underhanded way of silent comdemnation, pointing out to her
likability.

It turns out this was Kellyanne Conway's idea, in a memoir I read, DJ
is not following direction in one case, and KC chides him "I am trying
to make this about her, why don't you let me?".

So given that strategy, debates were a success for Trump.  If criteria
was to "hit a terrible man with bunch of stuff" than it'd be a success
for Hillary. But DJT was playing a different game.

"Hillary did well on all debates, yet she lost"

Remember 2000 Rep primary, largely an empty field. After Clint
impeachment which backfired, incumb popularity was high. The Rep

remember his name. Empty field.

Which other profession does software work resemble most? It's probably
more like construction than rocket science. I already talked abt 90%
of SV do not use math, or even computer science. They are usually
dealing with shuffling shit around, trying to build artificats that
are maintainable, with good enough foundation, and look good - all
these concepts resemble construction and on a visual sense, building
architecture. A project, program manager isn't a like NASA admin, he
is more like a construction foreman.

I am saying this so lawmakers, bureucracy does not treat these ppl as
if they are geniuses. They sure as shit are not.

Silicon Valley is like anywhere else in terms of the depth of its
politics. How much would a doctor, lawyer, etc would know? SV's pol
stance is a little Trek, a little Zen, mixed up with little
libertardism, sometimes centrism. The best politically-aware coworker
I knew could drop that spiffy *Team of Rivals* reference, but that
just means you read the *New York Times*. If that were enough there'd
be political genuises all around us already. U need take that [extra
step](../../2018/12/the-road-to-oblivion.md), if not more.

Now there is some backbone, social awereness in open-source circles -
but you won't come across to these guys in polite company.

Nice vid on Loop Quantum Gravity.

Background independency is key.

AFAIK Smolin has since moved on to greener pastures, apparently he
lost hope on LQG. His new theory, [the ensemble
approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2822), is also B.I. but can
reproduce QM formulas in an approximation.

F--in Dubya. This guy was one of the best political operators. There
was a moment after Trump mishaps 2017ish where where he could salvage
his image, he jumps in with a whole new speech complete with a new
self-deprecating joke ("I was misunderestimated"), some other
stories. . When did you pull that off? Do you have speech writers on
hand, waiting for that signal to write the next speech after being
away from pol >8 yrs?  Unbelievable.
