CEOs can want to "burn the shortsellers" occasionally, and act on it if they can. The reflex is not unnormal. Bezos did it, changed amzn invsmt, profit balance, and burned them. What he did not do is meddling in shady shit, like "funding secured at blah".

@adamjohnsonNYC

Why is Beto running for president in 2003? the democratic base today is hardened and more ideological and saw vapid centrism eat away their pensions and wages and gave us two decades of perma-war. Nobody wants this. How can someone so badly misread the times?

---

For an "hacker" from the "alternative culture" he sure became a lukewarm mainstream waffler. Do people know this guy's voting record? Or are they being led by the nose through one media sensation after another? #beto

Cap Marvel is watchable. It's no CA Winter Soldier but CA's first
movie did not have much flash either.

The main actress is likeable. Maybe they worked on that, so she didnt
come across like a flaming bitch.

"It's like a buddy-cop movie".

Right. Maybe to show she can buddy up. Or whatever.

Trump enjoys incumbent 2nd term _party_ advantage. Incumbent president in his party's 3rd, 4th, .. term has no advantage. See HW 1992. He lost.

US consulate moved here not too long ago. They picked a good location, maybe partly to monitor the strait?

What's the big deal with Beto? He is just a suave fuck. He's got nothing else.

Ah. Another Leave the Child Behind type. They always get more
accolades than they deserve. #beto

JFK comparison is apt, also a LTCB. People subconciously see the
connection. Incidentally both are unfit and out of their depth for
high office.

If Blair can control his thirdwayist, ultra-cap weirdo leanings, he could turn into a tech-aware ex-politician with some say. He started to say more on tech. I welcome this. Leave Corbyn alone. Do this other stuff.

So the left needs to prepare itself for the most likely outcome. When centrist implode thru Biden, you want to be far away from that so none of the shit spills on you. 

That means distancing urself from the "moderates". Given a choice btw bashing them or the rightz, u bash them

.. if they have a shortcoming, you bring it up. Dont wait for the "other side" to do it.

How do artists make money wout copyright? I guarantee it Stephen King would still become a millionaire by the "lightning likes" he'll get for his books, made available freely on the Net.

He would be on UBI while struggling for his first book

Come to think of it, JK Rowling was on gov welfare while she wrote her first Harry Potter book.

generations since the emergence of human species, 7,500 since human
physiology reached its current state, 500 since the agricultural
revolution, and only 20 since the scientific revolution

money. If oil money is not paying for programs u cut programs. If you
print money u create inflation ur currency collapses. #venezuella

"MIT Open Courseware long preceded the MOOC boom, and having done some

DJT win would be because of incumb, popularity, econ on his
watch. Elections are about incumbents, about people, leaders not about
the pretty "ideas" anyone puts forward. But the dumbass centrist
spewing will coincide with the pummeling in ppls minds, so it will be
discredited.

---

Actually the most likely outcome is still good for
progressives. Frontrunner Biden gets nom, proceeds to election spewing
his dumbass centrist bullshit, but even with econ slowdown (growth
near 1%) gets pummeled to the ground by Trump (pred is
clear). "Moderates" are discredited

Of course I'd like Bernie getting nom (likely) and the Hail Mary win
of presidency. That'd be a BIG Hail Mary.
