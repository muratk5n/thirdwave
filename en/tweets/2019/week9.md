Yea - there ain't enough cowshit to fuel such transport (assuming the

Three months into using a Pixelbook as my main consulting and dev
laptop, doing @LookerData + @SnowflakeDB dev in the cloud and running
http://getdbt.com from the built-in Linux CLI. One-third the cost of
an Apple MBP, instant-on and a keyboard you can actually type on

But.. but.. I did some space stuff, doesn't the coolness from there rub off on the car stuff..?

No it doesn't, punk. You have to perform equally on both to be applauded equally.

I wanted to make this point b4.  What I dont like is fuckin MMT sausage-making-tied-to-$$-printing. As in any piece of legislation being able to print money into existence. That is a no-no.

But for a controlled, 1-shot legislation, whose infl effect will be limited, it can be ok

---

Haha... I was expecting to hear no growth in money supply so no inflation, but AY saz 1 trillion will be printed. 

NOW GET THIS: if printing is tied to one shot legislation it can be okay.

Hmm.. code for work is WHO YOU ARE; but if ppl are working on what they like, wout pay, I wonder if that still counts. So UBI could be fine in that sense.

The code for money is PROOF tho, so that could be a problem. Unless money eventually received from work while being supported by UBI is sold as a positive.

This is how you deal with codes; u dont solve based on them, only morons do that, think culturally. U sell to them.
