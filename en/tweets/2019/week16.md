The only conclusive thing you can say about pop growth -> econ growth causal relation is that it is inconclusive. You can argue tech (econ) -> pop growth easier in many ways than the other direction. Noone can disagree indust revolution helped populations grow.

Impeachment proceedings would energize centrists a little more and help Biden to get nom, and he would lose the general in a big way. Or Bernie gets nom has more of a chance in gen (but still with disadvant). Either way I dont care. 1st opt centrists will get a major hit tho.

Is there enough to impeach: no. After Russia hoax this is another line that helps unify Dems and cuddle centrist losers.

Jordanson Peterson... hiding behind his laptop like a little
bitch.. Watching the Zizek debate. It's glorious.

I don't want to be too unfair on Jordanson Peterson. It's a general
attack laid on cons that they are idiots. It's sad they have to defend
themselves on intellectual grounds so much bcz the other side keeps
attacking them that way. Their angle was never intellectual.

The con stance, which comes naturally to a lot of ppl, with its
family, country, etc. is almost the absence of intellectualism. Some
parts of the left attack them from that direction tho bcz they are
devoid of ideas themselves.

I hope this election will see the end of "we'll get business to give ...[insert social good]...to its employees" to provide for citizens. A particular kind of centrist cancer set in the Democratic Party which saw businesses at the center of all things.

So naturally Reps wanted to free biz, Dems wanted to burden them. But biz should not be the center of social help. Free college, M4A, nationalized transport, security operate outside them.

[Luke Savage](https://twitter.com/LukewSavage/status/1116475950059757569)

Centrism is not a program or a coherent set of beliefs. It's an elite pathology concerned with offering people the absolute minimum institutional power is willing to concede at a given time (which is often less than nothing) and calling this "progress".

A: Savage

Q: Wouldn't copyrights impede the development of art by reducing
funding for artists, authors?

A: One of the reasons I comfortably push for "zero copyrights +
reward-like free art" is seeing how generous people are on the Net for
those things. Just watch one of those live shows on Youtube with
its "superchats" (money given in the chat window accompanied by a
question / comment), from viewers. $$ rains on them like a
motherlover. In one show a viewer dropped a wad (digitally speaking)
so huge, tuber was speechless for a while. Not sure what the
amount was, maybe in the thousands. But there is amazing potential out
there. And this is for a random dude talking. Imagine the rewards for
a big-tent professional well-made movie, art.

Q: A lot of your approaches are less-restriction-beforehand-reward-afterhand.

A: Yes; I instinctively like these approaches bcz it provides more
freedom, plus it can scale. Let's have social nets with zero censoring
(and are distributed, truly peer-to-peer), less focus on pre-filters
means dissemination, discussion is faster. Filters are installed on
the clients,. and even the creation of filter packages would be open,
there should be competition among them, so ppl can boast "I am the
maintainer of FamilyPG2019 filter package [which filters out X,Y but
not Z]". Whichever package you like, you download it, and install
it. If you think abt it, filtering does belong as close to consumer as
possible. At home parents decide, at work IT managers / CEO decide.

Q: But if you lose copyrights on imaginary characters (say superheros, Star
Trek) that would mean anyone can make such art, degrading the quality.

A: Righht, and current approach to copyright did SUCH wonders for Star
Trek (one example). The franchise appears fukked beyond repair at this
moment, such that its comedy counterpart (*The Orville* -Star Trek TNG
with Fart Jokes-) is doing better Trek than Trek right now. We all see
what is going on with *Star Trek Discovery* (some call it Disco, some
call it STD, for short), and Jar Jar Abrahams movies with its
alternate universe, multiverse. And one reason for such meanderings
was the fact that because of corporate necessities / legal issues
parts of Trek license remained somewhere, other parts somewhere else,
lawyers literally told STD to make the show "20% different", which
contributed to their change in direction fans ended up hating. Veering
off canon also hurts your merchandise sales. Oh, and let's not forget
these new shows also had to be Woke and SJW compliant now which meant
they are 50% dumber by definition. But that's for another post.

It seems Trek, franchise based movies would be much better off without
copyrights. Who would dare to make a Spiderman movie which is not
sanctioned by Stan Lee, or whoever is the standard bearer at Marvel?
And if they did who would watch it? Plus when fans generate content on
established canon, it's a good thing for the franchise. Star Wars and
Trek benefited greatly from such fan generated fiction. George Lucas
fought the fans on such derivative work for a while, but later gave
up, and it turned out for the better.

I am very serious on this. This is not a cherry-on-top nice-to-have
position. We need this. We need to reduce friction, increase
dissemination, increase scale. Otherwise we are fukked. No patents, no
copyrights. 

Q: Critics say it is unfair to have a trans woman competing in female
sport with a biologically male body.

A: Critics are right

They might argue back "well these are just some divisions,
categorizations, why do they matter so much?". By that logic male /
female division is also arbitrary, why worry about that also?  So the
problem is further categorization on existing categories become
complicated because of the first one. Let's look at that first
categorization: Should men compete against women in all sports? No.

We are also seeing a problem of finer-and-finer categorization. The
answer to that is simple: trans athletes can compete against other
trans athletes.

We need to humanize education more than we need to personalize

A: Ed should be reoriented around access to quality. No need for hand

lecture videos, distribute them to kids. [Done](../../2017/09/education.html).


"But I had a great teacher in high school". This is not about your
dear teacher, or any other good teachers who are, sadly, rare. We
can't scale "I had a great teacher in high school". We can scale bits
though, and by seperating teaching from the certifying.

"We can educate great teachers for public schools in big
 numbers".

No you can't. Also, how is this different than any dipshit billionaire
saying education will fix poverty? You know that can't be done in
scale. We should scale the one thing we know we can scale.

Former Energy Sec. Steven Chu told a roomful of scientists in Chicago
they should think now what they could do with renewable electricity
that costs only 1.5¢ per kilowatt hour. And, he suggested, those
thoughts should include hydrogen.

"The cost of renewable energy at the best sites is 2¢ per kilowatt
hour. And that is going to widen," Chu said at the University of
Chicago in March. "I’m an advisor to Royal Dutch Shell. They think
within a couple decades the very best sites will go to 1.5¢ per
kilowatt hour cost of electricity.

A: Great.

Chu is a former U.S. Secretary of Energy, and 1997 Nobel Prize
winner in physics.

Q: I want to lose weight

A: You really can survive on one meal a day (make it breakfast). This is
the hunter-gatherer way (still our biology). Eat something rich in
proteins, nutrients. Meat is one of those dense foods, lots in small
volume. This is how we reduced our stomach size and increased our
brain size. Gorillas are vegeterian, big stomach, they had to eat lots
of plants to satiate themselves. Less nutritous, have to eat more.

Look at the pics of hungry kids in Africa - big stomach. Or a fat slob
in America; same problem. Eating less nutritious food, less protein,
it'll eff you up.

Q: How does infinity help mathematicians?

A: Reading the great book by Strogatz *Infinity Powers* made me
realize infinity is a tool (mostly, for mathematicians, especially for
Calculus). You use it to simplify stuff. No really.

Friend asked me a puzzle question once. "You and your friend have a
loaf of bread, how do you make sure you divide it equally between two
of you?". The "right" answer is "have your friend cut it into two, but
you choose the piece you want". This utilizes psychology.

My answer was "divide it into thin little slices, for each slice give 1
piece to you 1 piece to me, etc".  And , "the division will approach
equality *in the limit*". This answer utilizes Calculus..

So chopping stuff into pieces literally solves problems for you. 

Q: Creating food out of thin air seems so sci-fi. How is this possible?

A: The process is not too complex really. H2 for energy and CO2 for
carbon is fed to special bacterias that generate food in powder form.

[Video](https://youtu.be/g2ygh9HQugY?t=276)

The process is not unlike making beer or wine. A special microbe eats
sugar produces wine. Here eats H2 and CO2 generates food.

Q: Why is Japan into hydrogen?

A: Japan is always a good country to watch, on energy. When the main
fuel is oil, Japanese looked around and said "I dont got it". The
answer: invent the supertanker, transport oil from the Middle East,
the more at one shot the better.

For renewables, it's about the sunshine, wind; Japanese look around "I
dont got that either". The answer: find the densest transportable
energy source, from the nearest sunny place: Hydrogen from
Australia. U need high energy density to get the most bang for your
buck.

The industry can continue to decarbonize the power grid for many years by using a mix of natural gas and renewable power generation. However, how do we continue to make progress in places like California, where coal-fired power generation is already retired, and where excess renewable electricity is causing market distortions? Progress will have to be defined differently.

The answer lies in the next phase of development: the storage of electricity using hydrogen.

In the last century, hydrogen powered the space program and brought us to the moon. 

A: Right on

Q: BEVs (battery electric vehicles) might be a bad idea but I like
them, I like the torque.

A: FCEVs (fuel-cell electric vehicles) are electric cars too let's not
forget. There is no combustion, no burning. The difference is
electricity comes from a fuel (through a catalysis, a special
membrane) rather than lithium-ion batteries whose performance is
inferior due to their rechargable nature.

BEVs try to solve too many things at once. One is let's have an EV
with clean motor, second is let's have a battery that does not weigh a
ton, charges fast, etc. The world cannot wait while the monkey boy
flails, trying to do it all.

Q: If you had to pick one place to start for H2 adoption, where would it be?

A: Buses

Buses are the simplest / best first place to go for H2 adoption. They
carry a lot of ppl, constantly in use, n pollute a lot. But they are
also under the control of a single mayorality, so a mayor can order
their change wholesale. Then wazoom! Clean xport 4 all.

Best part is their fueling; buses go through certain stops all the
time. Cities only need to provide fuel stations at key points, and you
are done.

By change it is meant either refurb existing buses as fuel-cell, or buying new ones. 

Fed gov could play a role providing pointers for tech refurb, or
directing cities to the companies ppl knowledgeable in the area.

Obviously as BEVs are a bad idea for cars, they are even a stupider
idea for buses. They would take half a day to refuel!

Comment

The most important reason why China is getting into hydrogen is that
it has recognized the problem with the infrastructure of building
charging stations for all battery-powered elecric vehicles in
China. The majority of Chinese people live in multi-family homes in
densely populated cities, so they have no way to load their cars at
home. It is the same situation as in Tokyo and many other Asian
cities.

A: Good point

[Comment](https://mobile.twitter.com/MLiebreich/status/879467384473616384)

If it means anything, “base-load” means generating capacity that is
rarely if ever switched off, indeed which is expensive or impossible
to switch off. When coal and existing nuclear power plants were the
cheapest sources of power, and before the risk of climate change was
well understood, that might have been acceptable. But now, if
consumers are to gain the cost and climate benefits from super-cheap
renewable power, what is needed is flexible, dispatchable power by way
of complement, not inflexible base-load that crowds it out.  So, if
the actual or de facto nationalization of our power system is the
wrong answer, and an atavistic yearning for the simplicity of
base-load is the wrong answer, what is the right answer?

A: There is some archaic vocabulary around energy. Today when
electricity is generated from hydropower for example, the turbines
make on go-around which creates on cycle in the AC alternate
current. This current flows downstream, and must be consumed. Otherwise
it is lost.

This is the old vocabulary. In the future we will have renewable
energy generation, it could be intermittent, or excessive. We don't
care.  Alphabet (Google's parent company) has installations where
excess energy is stored as molten salt, I've heard of a similar
approach in the Middle East. Or pick any material with sufficient
energy density, like ammonia, we can store energy at room temparature,
with very rich content in hydrogen.

OpenAI research center postpones making its newest development
public because scientists at the company are worried that it is so
good so it could be dangerous.

A: I say to AI researchers, step on the gas and never look back. Use

up. Right now all we have is bunch of attention sluts with their
doomsday scenarios whose "let's be careful" talk can hamper the
progress of science.

Question

Are neural nets the final answer for AGI?

A: They may not be... Right now what we do is like using linear
regression to analyze ball drops. You will find a linear relation on
the right equation (a coefficient for that linear relation, from data,
that is) but that's only part of the picture. Replace regression with
NN for intelligence (nonlinear instead of linear), that's where we
are.

The deeper mathematical language for pattern matching, intelligence
still eludes us. Calculus gave that language to physics. We might need
the same for Intelligence.

Some might say "atoms, molecules work at a deeper level, at that basic
level the rules are more easily mathematicizable. Look at them wiggaz,
tiggaz, chiggaz, m'f'kas are too hodge-podge (because of evolution)"
you cant model _that_. Perhaps. But we still evolved to some kind of
optimality, which could be mathematicizable.

Mathematician Mumford started some work on a vision pattern language,
trying to build that machinery from ground up.

The above line of thought was partly triggered by
[this](https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/the-language-of-calculus/).

I believe this language vs. reverse-engineering opposition is the real
reason behind @GaryMarcus's beef with NNs. Marcus is a critic of the
"connectionist" approach.

Deep NNs did wonders as of late however. No complaining there.

Question

Can the structure of a neural net be seen as that language akin to mathematics?

A: Hmmm

NN structure as a language is not as expressive (yet) as mathematics
itself, and it does not lead to easy, straight-forward, algebraic-like
effortless (read: computation-less) manipulation. Also it itself does
not compute anything; whereas Calculus can compute using symbolic
manipulation alone.

Create a different measure if you want, but we need a measure like GDP

A: Fair point. But today it feels like there is a whole different
level of partisanship. Obviously Trump bears some of the blame. But
comedy overall it still too extreme on the one end. After a certain
threshold it's not even funny anymore.

Q: Where does comedy come from

A: Having strange characters around you helps

Leno talked abt his childhood once, his father, an Italian who ate only
Italian food all his life, would often point to Jay while outside,
to people eating foreign food, like "wow look at that white guy eating
nochos" or "look at the Chinese guy eating hot dogs". So people eating
out of their ethnic group was interesting to this man. You don't need
to add or subtract anything to that, it's already funny. This kinda
stuff can be source material. 

E.g. the conversation sequence I did
[here](../../2013/04/the-new-star-wars.md) (not that I am pro on this
at all), where an imaginary Pickard says "while you take a number two,
try not to pass any gas", I stole that from someone I knew. I went to
high-school with him actually, so this kid got it into his head he
could shit not fart. He became obsessed by it, he made it his project
and tried this for a week. He failed, and when he told me I nearly
cried.

Scientists Used IBM's Quantum Computer to Reverse Time, Possibly
Breaking a Law of Physics 

A: Sabina Hossfelder [responds](https://mobile.twitter.com/skdh/status/1107906567033245696):
"Once again: Scientists did not "reverse time" and did not "break a
law of physics". Correct story: Some processes are reversible. Entropy
can decrease locally. We have known this for a long time. Great
experiment - yes - but no time reversal. #StopHype

BEST analysis of what really is happening on the #Boeing737Max issue
[..] Bottom line don’t blame software that’s the band aid for many
other engineering and economic forces in effect.

Some people are calling the 737MAX tragedies a #software
failure. Here's my response: It's not a software problem. It was an

Economic problem

that the 737 engines used too much fuel, so they decided to install
more efficient engines with bigger fans and make the 737MAX.

Airframe problem.

They wanted to use the 737 airframe for economic reasons, but needed
more ground clearance with bigger engines.The 737 design can't be
practically modified to have taller main landing gear. The solution
was to mount them higher & more forward. This led to an;

Aerodynamic problem

The airframe with the engines mounted differently did not have
adequately stable handling at high AoA to be certifiable. Boeing
decided to create the MCAS system to electronically correct for the
aircraft's handling deficiencies.

During the course of developing the MCAS, there was a

Systems engineering problem

Boeing wanted the simplest possible fix that fit their existing
systems architecture, so that it required minimal engineering rework,
and minimal new training for pilots and maintenance crews.

A: Basically Boeing created a sub-optimal design in its hardware and
tried to make up for it in software. The software had to become more
unnecessarily complex which made it fragile, prone to failure which it
did.
