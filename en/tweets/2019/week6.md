No superhero makes Europeans laugh more than Batman. There's something abt that character..  I guess too over the top. Iron Man is fine. Not Batman.

Disco S02E04 - not too shabby. Feels more Trek each ep. Fantastic #1

Less of that Klingon shite plz too and I think Disco is slowly phasing that stuff out. Hopefully we saw the last of that in E03, whatever that frckin storyline was, human/K dude joined Section 31, and it's done?

These scenes look like a Kiss concert  man, where all band members in need of a Heimlich maneuver. Garg garg... gaaarrrggg!

Gold has severe flaws. Physical locality makes it less secure and far more transactionally local, and thus more vulnerable to politics and less sound, than we can now achieve with Bitcoin, with good key management and taking advantage of its trust-minimized global settlement.

I love how Millennials are Ghosting Banks

Millennials are the largest generation in the US.

77 percent feel the traditional financial system is “designed to favor the rich and powerful.” 

75 percent worry about the global financial system being hacked.

Bitcoin has no fav's.

A common theme in science fiction is that in the future, mankind has learned from its wars and has a unified world government.

Alternative: mankind has learned that centralization is fragile and now has 10,000 sovereign but cooperative states, like Switzerland writ large.

NYT added major # of subscribers past year, making loads of $$$ there. I see TYT is pushing for it too.

For publishers it is a "surer" revenue stream. In the coming month u know your earnings. Pretty cool.

"I definitely believe this. @Tesla did not disclose the extreme range
reduction you get in cold weather. On most trips in my model 3 I get
50% less range than the car estimates. (This has been in 10-40F degree
weather)."

Tesla disputes the claim"

No you cant create a cabal member, secret society, ___insert weirdness__ out of Tusk. He is a knuckle head from the streets of Warsaw. He said what he said bcz he is truly pissed at Brits and Brexiteers.

What is infuriating for the EU is the curr arrangement was best for UK. Now they are asked to give some imaginative 'better' when they can't do the old best anymore.

@librarythingtim

Will someone explain to me what Patreon spent $107m on—and it's not enough? Literally, how does their simple service cost that much to make and run? Okay, I'm cheap as hell in how I run mine, but seems off by an order of magnitude to what I'd consider sufficient for the job.

No need for "smart grid" that is supposedly based on "DC energy" and will reroute energy to where it is needed. This is 90s style old-skool Al Gore environmentalism. There is already an energy carrier based on molecules, with xport infrastructure to take it where it's needed.

Downsample to 3%, data for 1 huge grid becomes 2 MB. Sheeeeet

If u have continous func, u can get elevation data at any
resolution. This is key for flattest path algo.

Next, next step; seeing if heat flow PDE can be used to find
path. Higher elev can be seen less thermal conductvity, start pos is
heat source, target is sink 

---

Imma fit Gaussian bumps on elevation data w RBF to have smooth, continous funcs as mountains. 

However 100m corresponds to 0.001 change on lat/lon. A box (20,30),(21,31) has 1 mil pts. Solution: downsample. Dude did it, reports good results on the fit.

TV guy said "Martin Luther Coon"? What a jackass..

Funny story with that word. First time I heard it was during OJ
trials. There was an OJ joke for everything. This one goes "one day OJ
comes to the courtroom, in a Hawaii shirt, summer outfit. His lawyer
asks him 'what is going on OJ? Why r u dressed like this?'

OJ says 'I thought you said we was going to Cancun'. Lawyer says 'no,
I said you are going to the can, coon'". Joke was triggered bcz we
were going to Cancun.

Guy who told us the joke was racially .. everything, except black,
hence the joke I guess.

Funnier thing is the same guy ran someone over with his car, while
drunk, killing him, and went to the slammer himself for 10 years for
manslaughter :| How's that 4 a story?
