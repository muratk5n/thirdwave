"I don't hate writing. I love writing. What I hate is to write in the
style that makes papers and grants accepted, which includes a LOT of
overselling and obfuscation. Too many times writing in a way everyone
can understand results in reviewers commenting your results are
trivial."

Ok, that for-tax guy on Fox (Tucker) might have been somewhat on edge
bcz he was on Fox. I see lefties on Fox sometimes, they look really
stiff, always expecting a punch from somewhere. I don't blame them.

They remind me of this scene.

More ultra-capitalist psyop fuckery.. The man "changed". The subtext
is if he made this change _somehow_ before, maybe he would not be
homeless. All it took was putting on the uniform of modernity (any
burgeois clothing would do, hip, or otherwise) and voila, he'd be in.

Yea forget Don Jr. - Kush is getting incredibly high-level exposure, experience at a young age (most wait for long time to reach such a position), he can build on that later. Assuming of course things dont go belly-up for Reps.

Increasing spending on existing production will simply increase inflation. In the same vain "give ppl more money to spend" is not an economic argument. It is a social argument, a helping hand to them, not necessarily the economy.

---

That assumes spending increase directly translate into GDP increase. This supposition is false. Increasing credit on the supply side drives growth.

@glichfield

A few days ago we ran a piece in @techreview about some research
purporting to explain the "hipster effect"‚Äîthe fact that
nonconformists often end up nonconforming in the same way. We used a
stock Getty photo of a hipster-ish-looking man.

We promptly got a furious email from a man who said he was the guy in
the photo. He accused us of slandering him, presumably by implying he
was a hipster, and of using the pic without his permission. (He wasn't
too complimentary about the story, either.)

In other words, the guy who'd threatened to sue us for misusing his
image wasn't the one in the photo. He'd misidentified himself.

All of which just proves the story we ran: Hipsters look so much alike
that they can‚Äôt even tell themselves apart from each other.
