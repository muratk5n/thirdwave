Yang is coming apart; saw him on Igraham with a lost voice. I dont
think he appreciated the grind of retail politics before... It's not
about pretty ideas; it's about the leader (whose ideas must be
embodied in his person) who will lead to the promised land.

They came for his campaign with that bullshit debate. U had to see
that coming. U need huge endorsements.

Having held previous office is a must, media exp if not. People need
to see u deciding, leading on stuff. Odd but DJT on the Appr was
that. Most top cands have held office.

Still silently rooting for Yang of course but always keep an eye on
the polls. On the way down I kick a man down, and pile on. If doing
good I'll cheer and be a follower. Am very opportunistic that way.

"Whoa! It turns out that famous examples of NLP systems succeeding and failing were very misleading. “Man is to king as woman is to queen” only works if the model is hardcoded not to be able to say “king” for the last word."

Hinton spun up a good tale around this biz, hinting this "statistical stuff" is as good as building a GI on, as if we had any meaningful algebra around the subject the way pysicists had Calculus.

Yeah centrists liked natgas it was like a "middle-ground", but methane leakage kills that arg. And this article says even the carbon part is no good news.

Worldwide effort required to convert fossil->H2 near to the point of production, than distribute H2 using the existing gas network. The longer energy remains fossil throughout transport, storage, the larger the chances of it polluting the environment.

If nothing is done on this, sabotage on key fossil fuel infrastructure will be thought by extremists. Let's reform this stuff before things get there.

I still want Corbyn as PM. His angle probably is  pullimg himself out of any controversial pos so Cons destroy themselves thorougly.. Hopefully this doesnt harm Labor in the process.

".. We refunded all of our deposits because we didn’t want people to think we were using their money to fund our company. We have no debt. That was an important thing to me."

H2 is not only a better form of energy storage, it also attracts non-charlatans, solid thinkers.
