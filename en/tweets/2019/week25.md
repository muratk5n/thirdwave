Aah the element 115. Scientists knew elements above 100 would / could be synthesized, during 60s. You didnt need Bob Lazar for that.

Bob Lazar has profile attribute 282B, "they have an intense desire to be something unique or to see something more than the ordinary. They are day-dreamers [..] and want to identify with something beyond what is normally expected of people [..] have a tendency to engage in escapist and self-destructive fantasies and/or
habits, the reason is usually is a weak ego and loss of identity in childhood""

Make of it what you will, but fantasification is as likely as the real thing. 

Do I believe UFOs? 

I could not refute it easily based on [this data](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2015/08/q-38.html)

There really isn't one much one can say confidently on the subject IMO.

Trump's net approval is at -11% (approval at %42 minus disproval at
53%). But still it's not enough.

His predicted elec. college vote share is btw 49.73% ad 53.28%,
assuming 2% gdp growth. With 0% gdp growth he still has advantage but
the other side has some chance.

This is crazy. He took that picture with equipment in his back porch? 

This says

"[T]he image was the result of 500 pictures being taken on a video camera. Those pictures were then combined using software that took out the effects of the Earth's atmosphere."

Still, crazy.

How do you even pinpoint the thing? U know u move the telescope a

Actors like variety. He was a buttoned-up, example figure last time, he is apparently a shadier figure in this one. I bet that is the only reason he agreed to do it in fact, bcz Picard would be different this time. An actor's job is not deciding the future of a franchise; whoever has the stake, money and the ownership of the brand does that. 

"If the Picard show was so bad on paper why did Patrick Stewart agree to do it?"

People in CH used WeChat app for payments like mad, some 9 trillion $ were spent through WeChat in 2016; that would be akin to using WhatsApp for payments which currently its users cannot. Why is the financial system so schlerotic when it comes to payments? Even a system like Paypal ended up being another "site" that is in its own silo. It is 2019 and we are hoping some weird, yet unknown private crypto solution to help us. Obviously over-centralized state is good at unifying disparate systems, but still, it feels like there should have been more innovation in this space.

Hopefully Libra catches on.

I wonder if the IR Prez actually wants a US attack so internal
politics is "rearranged". He doesn't get along with the mullahs who
watch over the politicians and constantly keep them at bay. I read
Rouhani was asked abt a certain indirect criticism mullahs made toward
him and when asked 'who did the grand ayatollah meant by that?'
reportedly he deadpanned 'Himself', and ppl laughed. That comes as
close to flipping the bird in Iranian politics as anything and raised
eyebrows. What's going on in there?

My Nancy - JFK thing is no drubbing related to non-impeachement BTW. I really dont care what happens, but she is probably right not to go there since it would divide the party. People who push for it are most likey happy to be "pushing for impeachement when it is not on the table", appearing to be gung-ho when in fact, if given the gun, they would not pull the trigger themselves. It's politics.

Is Japan private debt mosty household debt? No. I checked. Most of the private debt is businesses. 

---

The problem is too much private debt. There was some deleveraging but
not nearly enough. Companies are servicing debt with debt rather than
creating value. BOJ needs to increase rates to, say 5%, watch zombie
companies die, bankruptcies will clear away junk and their debt, so
new companies can borrow and create value. Textbook says with low
growth decrease rates but u r off textbook territory now.

"China is acting aggressively in the South China sea, impeding US".

Well, the sea is near China. It is called the South *China* Sea, in
their area of influence. What would US think if a foreign military was
running amok in the Bay of Mexico?

But nobody's entitled to anything, and US does not want China gain
more influence in SCS, fine, China's neighbors probably don't either,
so there is a power play going on here. In terms of that, I dont
particularly care if China is blocked in its ambitions or not.
