"1K$/month UBI is not enough to live on" say some, but there are places in US where u can perfectly live on that amt. The keyword is: live.

UBI might encourage moving to cheaper more sparsely populated places, and that might not altogether be a bad thing.

Have to add: money printing tied to Congressional sausage making is as bad as a single executive deciding when to print. Politicians should not have this ability, period. Otherwise you are Zimbabwe, Venezuella.

Why was Kurd terr. leader given to TR by US in 90s? So TR's worries on
N. Iraq would be minimized, Kurd issue would become an internal issue,

mystery where none exists. U cant think in headlines.

Perhaps what's *most remarkable* about the @OpenAI controversy is how *unremarkable* the technology is. Despite their outsize attention & budget, the research itself is perfectly ordinary‚Äîright in the main branch of deep learning NLP research

Poor cat... he is being experimented on.

"Recordings were made from forty acutely prepared cats, anaesthetized
with thiopental sodium, and maintained in light sleep with additional
doses by observing the electro-corticogram. Animals were paralysed
with succinylcholine to stabilize the eyes"

He is like "if I ever get out of here I will get on a communic. system
and let ppl know of my plight, thru this thing I'll call a meme".

Come to think of it, it's year 2019, decades into the digital
revolution, and u still cant f--king send micropayments, fast using
fiat. If u asked me abt the future during 80s and such payments I'd
have said "of course!". "That'll happen in a jif son".

Never underestimate the old. How arthritic, how entrenched it can get.

Trump net approval -8% up from abysmal -20s. But; now that we know growth will suffer, with 0% growth DJT 2020 chances are btw [49.25% 52.0%], with -2% growth it is [48.6%, 50.37%].

If growth were around 2% I'd throw Biden into the fire and let him burn, by extension centrists.

"Two options for crypto projects:

1.) Sit on your hands for 50+ years and wait for the holy ‚Äúhyper bitcoinization‚Äù so everyone thinks in Satoshis.

2.) Accept that the dollar is actually pretty great and start building with Dai today.

The next few years will be fascinating."

Replying to @ricburton

"False dichotomy. Most bitcoin users in the future may not even know
they're using bitcoin."

Right. Bcz with current fiat we still cannot make micro/fast/frequent
payments, BTC/LN could provide that service to fiat.

Having said that, fiat is not "pretty great", so its replacement will
not be a total loss IMO.
