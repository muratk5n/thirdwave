I just remembered the great 90s movie The American President (starring
M. Douglas) was all abt gun control. Like, the movie sold it like the
most important issue ever, enough to hinge an entire movie around
it. "I am sending 455 to the floor". "Oh honey f--k me".

Courtesies of Aaron Sorkin of course. The king of polishing 90s,
centrist, corporate Dem turd and make it shiny, technical, "smart",
"Trek-like".

TAP is the origin of the West Wing BTW. More turd, spread among eps
now, and many seasons.

Oh yeah and the great speech at the end "I'll go door by door and
collect all the guns". Yeah good luck with that.

(Repurchase is better. Plus if u talk abt left issues more u wld solve
guns easier).

Clearly the 90s were a gran'ol time.

Cutting Iranian oil exports in this way is escalation. The requests heaped on them for a return to normal dont seem like stuff Iranians will go for; that's why I keep thinking, is US itching for war? Or bluffing really well? Squeezing China thru their oil imports?

Of course Trump is partly to blame #abortion But the pol climate is still littered with fucking centrists, on the Dem side (Biden is frontrunner hello), the other side still need to distinguish themselves through hot button issues.

Bootyjudge and Shapiro feel like two milenials similar somehow, 1 on the left 1 on the right, but similar. During their formative yrs, 90s, one would soak up the Clintonite West-Wing spinster cool, the other unfettered free-tradism. They dont seem to have woken up ..

.. to the repercussions of that era tho. I wonder why. Is it bcz they were particularly smart, groking the era but locking it in, or particularly dumb for not checking historical context and the after-effects. Shapiro's free-tradism looks especially sad.

Free trader goldcuck is like "oh no no, don't touch anything".  This ain't free, and it ain't trade. This is also abt multinational corps exploiting workers in another country through an opressive state that isnt their own.

"Changing of the current trade scheme is not in China's interest". Of course it isn't. Which country doesnt want free-range access to every tech secret within their borders? That is what forced tech xfer policy does.

Maybe it is unfair to label GoT, Star Wars fails completely due to SJW. Maybe they r the result of them distancing themselves from their creator' vision. SW is not Lucas' anymore, bad GoTs were done wout book material.
