Continuous rocks.

"[A Feynman story] The router of the Connection Machine [a startup
Feynman joined, led by grad students] was the part of the hardware
that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated
device; by comparison, the processors themselves were
simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of
processors was impractical since a million processors would require
$10^{12]$ wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a
20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to
talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate
simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The
router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional
traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer
until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether
we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently
[..]

By the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis
of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement,
he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential
equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer
designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous,
differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations
were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as
"the average number of 1 bits in a message address." I was much more
accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case
analysis than taking the derivative of "the number of 1's" with
respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers
per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We
decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman.

The decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but
by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had
designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to
solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to
five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his
unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better
to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller
number of buffers.

Fortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine
worked."

Derivation of LQR through E-L, it will be a clean explanation. 

Also optimal trajectory (really is a 'solution' of an ODE) through an

calc like fuel max for rocket lander, vertical moves consume more,
hori less, minimize cost functional, find ODE, solve, get traj.

That is bullshit. Only 2% of our labor is required to feed everyone
(farm employment). The rest, industrial production, is already being
taken over by robots. Most software is developed by the few. We can
easily sustain everyone.

This is how these ppl think: "hmm growth of ... percent required to
fund...  program, at ... tax rates, let's project that.... ".

Forget all the garbage economics in between producer and the consumer;
at point t, can u feed ppl or not? Yes. Then we can get them the goods
and services. You just rearrange the middle part to fit the rest, not
the other way around.

Don't be an imbecile. A dildo could connect these dots.

In the academic world, one approach dominated. The IS-LM model that John Hicks and Alvin Hansen had separately extracted, formulated and codified from Keynes‚Äôs General Theory had become the fundamental way of thinking about the macroeconomy: a set of behavioral equations determined ‚Äòequilibrium‚Äô ... 

. . (A modified version of that approach remains the preferred tool of undergraduate teaching today).

Leijonhufvud got something entirely different from reading the General Theory. The more he looked at his footnotes, originally written in puzzlement at the disparity between what he took to be the Keynesian message and the orthodox Keynesianism of his time, the more confident he felt. The implications were amazing. Had the whole discipline catastrophically misunderstood Keynes‚Äô deeply revolutionary ideas?
