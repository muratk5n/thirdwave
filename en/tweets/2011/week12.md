# Week 12

Due to the success of Q&A sites like Stackoverflow, new sites with the
same idea started multiplying like mushrooms. Quora is one example, SO
guys themselves created new sites based on the SO idea, for different
topics.

I hang out at one of these sites called math.stackexchange. One day I
asked theoretical question on Calculus, and this dude answered --
within hours, with three pages of math, history, and a detail so to
the point that everyone was shocked and amazed at this outcome. The
answer was exactly what I was looking and more that I cannot imagine
something like this won't have a profound effect on how education is
structured in near future.

In our outdated classroom system, someone, somewhere might ask a great
question, and maybe, get a great answer. SO and Quora allow a great
question, anywhere, anytime to be asked, and be answered by anyone,
anywhere, anytime. Better yet, this question and answer stream stays
around forever, indexed by Google, accessible at a click of a button.

How is this not a game changer? How can education stay the same with
the presence of such peer-to-peer technologies?

Noone certifies anyone to ask, or to answer a question on these Q&A
sites [1]. Anyone can ask, anyone can answer, and anyone can rate the
answers (the Q I mentioned before received tens of up votes). The
system is distributed, peer-to-peer at each level.

And it is disruptive precisely for this reason. Tech such as this can
and should replace the barbaric system we have today. If everyone
needs quality education to compete in the 21st century and, as we saw
in previous post Average Teachers that we cannot have millions of
quality teachers, then restructuring our current system that uses 3rd
Wave technology is a must.

Nothing less is sufficient.

[1] Specialization is a key point of the old industrial order. Guilds,
unions are formed around esoteric skillsets, this guild craves
influence, tries to exert power using its ability to issue
certificates, carefully keeps others out and negotiates for more power
and influence.

[2] The rating system of Q&A sites essentially replaces prior
certification process. And let me tell you, the rating can get
brutal. Any stupid, unrelated remark, comment gets down voted so fast
the person in question won't see what hit them. Great answers are up
voted, without exception, and praise rains on them. SO also has this
feature called "bounties", you can actually assign some of your points
to someone else in the form of a digital bounty, for great answers and
questions. Needless to say, points collected from answers, questions
are tallied on a user's profile, and these points can and has
influenced hiring decisions in the real world.

[3] We witness such "open to contribution" pattern a lot in Internet
based tech. On open source software projects for instance, the source
code is open to all to see, therefore, anyone can send a differential
(an improvement, bug fix) in the form of a patch file -- they can
email it to the project. Not all patches are applied to the source
base (this part is little different from Q&A sites), but just due to
the fact that anyone can see, anyone can send patches raises the
possibility of quality submits dramatically, and hence raises the
quality of the overall software.
