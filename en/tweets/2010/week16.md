# Week 16

Fast Company articleEven before students set foot in a classroom, most
schools still are built like factories: long hallways, lined with
metal lockers, transport students to identical, self-contained
classrooms. School designers call these hallways "double-loaded
corridors." The factory model of control and direct instruction still
pervades most new schools. If we are to have thorough-going school
reform, we must change the design model, too, starting with the place
students first enter the school.

When it comes to dieting, De Vany got part of the picture right
although he is describing is a diet suitable for blood type O. This
blood type is the oldest type, therefore has hunter gatherer
roots. The fact that you guys talked about sports for half an hour
before covering this topic is no coincidence because O is the only
blood type who is into competitive sports (the others have no interest
in it, whatsoever). De Vany talks about milk; again, "Type O" cannot
digest milk, they have problem dairy products. But other types AB, B
have no problem digesting dairy.

De Vany is on the right 'track' in so many ways, he just misses the
final and crucial point somehow. When hunter gatherers settled down
and started organized farming, yes this was different and in many
ways, unsuitable for type O. However, this is when evolution shifted
gears, and some O's evolved into type A. Type A is the 'farmer' blood
type and naturally, they have no problems eating grains.

But I benefited from this talk, especially the parts on insulin, heart
having to be at irregular rythm forth, only the dieting part needs a
little work. For more details on Blood Type Diet, you can search Peter
D'Adamo on the Web.

You want proof on 24's anti-bureucracy stance? OK. Before we start
though, this word actually does not do 24 justice... There is more at
work than meets the eye, 24 is anti-bureucracy, when it doesn't work,
but also anti-establishment, when it doesn't work. And let's be
honest, most of the time, both of these constructs fail to deliver the
kinds of results needed for 21st century.Take 8th Season. President
Taylor tries to cover-up the fact Russian government was involved in a
terorist attack in order to save some piece deal in Middle
East. (Leaving aside that US is portrayed naively as the powerful
hegamon, "the one to broker a deal") we see a president who tries to
keep a secret from people, going as far as trying to lock away Jack
Bauer because Bauer wants people to know Russians were involved in the
plot. The moment the president decides to cover this up, even
according to her own chief of staff she is on grounds for
impeachement. Also for Jack Bauer, the issue is very clear-cut. After
the said decision president Taylor is not fit for office. We said
Bauer represents "the people" right? Well, there you go; people "see"
this decision sucks. Can you lock away "the people"?No you can't. So
Bauer escapes, and soon is on the move again. This time, against his
own government.

Oh, while we are on the subject: People, "the crowd" being part of the
"show" is not a new development in art. This is essentally what the
judges in American Idol represent - they are the people. But we've
been doing this in our homes for ages, aren't we?  You sit in front of
TV and make comments on the show.. I've watched some movies with my
friends whose ramblings on a movie were actually funnier than the
movie itself. Remember Beavis and Butt-head. Not the "Cornolio" type
adventures obviously, the parts when they sit down and watch music
videos and poke fun, belittle, mock. Aren't we doing that for years?
Boy George.. Huhhh..huuhhh.. he doesn't look like "boy".. uhhh..On
Web-tech front: Isn't Web 2.0 all about crowdsourcing, power of the
people, etc? Clay Shirky's book "Here Comes Everybody" comes to mind,
as well as the cast of popular show Lost. This particular group of
people are, literally, everyone. People from all walks of life, corner
of the planet, type, age, gender and race.Moving on:24 also plays
around another concept present in Western World. Our theory is the
main cultural tug of war in Western world is between Jesus / Middle
Ages vs. Rome.Well, according to this theory, Jack Bauer is a
(post)modern day knight.This is all to clear. Besides, the concept of
a knight shows up again and again in American art. Iron Man is one
example, down to his body armor, but this analysis can be extended to
any superhero movie made lately; who are knights; They are autonamous,
have "fiefdoms" (a city, batcave, fortress of solitude, etc), and are
either in trouble with authorities, but always, seperate from them.On
the other side, there is Rome.This the the central despot, the king,
the ruler. Byziantum (II. Rome). The Ottomans (III. Rome).Pay
attention to the scene in 24 when Taylor presidency takes a turn for
the worst. The new "advisor" makes his case with these words from
Shakespeare's Julius Ceasar.There is a tide in the affairs of
men,Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortunewhich essentially
means the ends justify the means. Do whatever f..k you want, if it is
for something better.But in 3rd Wave world, where people are "wired"
and "informed"; this just does not cut it.And the knight, will not
take it.

Any show that runs for more than 5 seasons deserves attention, and
24, which has blown through this limit some time ago certainly
qualifies. Yes, it is known as a Republican show; we know Dick "Fuck
You, Big Time" Cheney watched it religiously -ahem-, and we know
radical radio show host Rush Limbaugh gave Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe
O'Brian) a full mouth kiss at some kind of Republican tribal gathering
once; Fine. We get it. Conservatives drink this shit like the
Kool-Aid.But as the TIME magazine piece here suggests; 24 isn't all
about gung-ho violence, torture - just another TV conservative
circle-jerk. Sure, it is a show that appeals to a certain crowd, it
asserts, plays with, dances around certain set of culture codes.  As
the main cultural tug of war in US is between prohibition and freedom
(as in letting it go), the main character in 24, Jack Bauer lets it go
a lot. He does not "contain himself", does what is necessary, et
cetera, et cetera. In this way, 24 episodes feel a lot like Tom Clancy
novels, you get the same sort of animosity against press (which surely
has to do with their irrelevance as of late but we'll leave that aside
for the moment), and at the same time skirting along another culture
code for sex, VIOLENCE - making an operator like Bauer so sexy man!
All of this is for emotional, second-level fuck brains obviously (I
don't know karate, but I know ka-raze! You know what I sayin'?). So,
the man (Bauer) both lets go and does violence, breaks the law .. er,
to protect it? OK: What's not to like? Or to criticise?

But, 24 actually manages to say more than this idiotic Clancy
McLiterature McNonsense. Let's ask ourselves: What is another theme
that occurs over and over in 24?You guessed right:Absolute, utter
institutional / bureucratic collapse.Jack Bauer actually is a pretty
fair representation of a fantasy operator who just does the optimal;
ignores the red tape, penetrates buruecratic silos, steps on toes,
crosses boundaries, kicks ass, takes names, and.. just.. does.. not
stop. Mind you, in today's modern, factory style, silo oriented
bureucracies, what he manages to do is no an easy feat: By 8th season,
Bauer knows so many people in all government departments that he is a
government onto himself. There is an attack to CTU (his homebase)? No
problem: He just calls NSA (another agency, silo) to close off some
road to stop a terrorist. FBI, CIA, any three letter agency you can
think of? Been there. Know them. The President? We are buddies! I'll
just call her. Say hello and ask some other thing. Or, I'll ignore
her, if she is getting in my way. As teenagers say nowadays:
What-ever.I am sure everyone watching the show instinctively know in
the back of their minds, that somone like Bauer cannot ever exist. Not
really. Someone like him would have been jailed, killed, neutralized
long ago (er - season one) for any his adventures to ever take
place. No, he is a fantasy, but more than that, Jack Bauer is actually
us. Us, in a first person (shooter?),. video game sense of the
word. Bauer is us, the viewer. The watcher. Through Jack Bauer, we get
to reach across the gap between us and the screen and meddle in the
neferious plots of terrorists, world leaders, as though we are in
control of this huge game. Because actions Bauer takes are absolutely
the same actions an average adult person would take, if s/he were
presented with the information in 24.
