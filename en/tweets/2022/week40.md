H2 Fuel News: "Quantron has a hydrogen fuel cell truck with a massive
range of 930 miles...  The company unveiled several long-range
H2-powered vehicles at the IAA Transportation show.

Quantron has been working with Ballard Power Systems¬†as a part of a
strategic partnership. Through it, the company has been able to
develop a hydrogen fuel cell truck that will be able to travel
considerable distances before needing to refuel.

This is a considerable achievement as it helps to further support the
viability of H2 as a fuel for the long-haul trucking industry,
particularly compared to the range available from battery electric
vehicles, which must also carry heavy batteries to stay powered and
that require notably longer recharging times...

The Quantron QHM FCEV (fuel cell electric vehicle) is equipped with an
FCmove-XD 120 kW fuel cell that is among Ballard‚Äôs latest
developments"

wells. Globally, the practice has persisted since oil production

The market must have been spooked by econ possibly heating up due to
lower taxes causing more inflation (risk for bondholders). Keeping
things calm, talking about balanced budgets (not that it directly
effects inflation) could also be conservative.. Sunak was actually
taking that line during the leadership race, but could not sell it.
As long Tories follow the "right" way not some centrist cuck way, it's
fine.

Math can deal with infinities but particles aren't infinite. There's
just a lot of them. Dealing with infinitesimals help with certain
stuff but they are by no means the true reflection of the underlying
mechanics.  It's all an approximation in the end. God does not need
math.

"Math and physics work bcz both are based on the many small particles"

Rubin, Summers got burned 

"During the 1992 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Bill
Clinton had talked tough on China‚Äîat one point accusing George
H. W. Bush, then president, of cozying up to 'the butchers of
Beijing.' In his confirmation hearings Warren Christopher, Clinton‚Äôs
choice for secretary of state, served notice that he would take a
tough line with China. So, in a move that the Chinese later dubbed
'the Clinton coup,' China‚Äôs top diplomats developed warm relations
with two of Clinton‚Äôs top economic advisers, Robert Rubin and Larry
Summers, who were more sympathetic to China, and worked through them
to persuade Clinton to dial back his antagonism. The Chinese had used
the same tactic during the Bush and Obama administrations, and they
had largely succeeded" \#Kush

---

Environment issues aren't just theoretical for many countries 

"When we arrived in Beijing [2017 visit], the city glistened in the
reflection of the pure blue sky. At the command of the Chinese
Communist Party, the coal-burning power plants and factories had been
shut down for the three weeks leading up to our visit to allow the
smog and soot to dissipate" \#Kush
