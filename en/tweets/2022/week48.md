H-Tec Systems presents scalable Hydrogen Cube System..The company
H-Tec Systems from Augsburg presented the Hydrogen Cube System, HCS
for short, to a wider specialist audience at the Hanover Fair 2022...

The Cubes are available both as a closed container solution for
outdoor installation and open for indoor installation. They are
equipped with 18 PEM stacks S450 and integrated process water
treatment and power supply...

<img width="340" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.hzwei.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4-H-TEC_HCS_5-gross.jpg"/>

Several 2 MW cubes of this system can be combined to form a
multi-megawatt system. A system that is intended to achieve 50 MW in
the long term can also be designed in this way. According to H-Tec
Systems, the cubes achieve a system efficiency of 74 percent. They are
equipped with an integrated process water treatment and power
supply. An HCS system with five units, i.e. with an electrolysis
capacity of 10 MW, can therefore produce 4,500 kg of H 2 per day. That
makes 40 to 50 tank fillings for trucks or buses.

Anything can be string-pickled üêç For coding `base64.encodestring` on

`zlib` for compression.  There are some other details, but this is
the gist.

Simple scalable NoSQL DB: N servers, on client calc i = (mod N) on
key, go to host i. Simple load disribution. REST can provide CRUD API,
serialize requests inside one server, storage can be lite sql,
seperate db for each host, objects are encoded via 'pickle" into
string. Lists are on sep table, list name is on one column obj
references on another as key. Easy as Py.

Britain's Rolls-Royce (RR.L) said it has successfully run an aircraft
engine on hydrogen, a world aviation first that marks a major step
towards proving the gas could be key to decarbonising air travel. The
ground test, using a converted Rolls-Royce AE 2100-A regional aircraft
engine, used green hydrogen created by wind and tidal power, the
British company said on Monday. Rolls and its testing programme
partner easyJet are seeking to prove that hydrogen can safely and
efficiently deliver power for civil aero engines"

That looks massive. Is there anything CSP folks can learn from? They
structured the whole thing differently, basically an entire building
became a reflector.

3K Celcius is a good chunk of energy to generate clean fuel with.

Wiki: "The solar furnace of Uzbekistan was built in 1981, and is
located 45 kilometers away from Tashkent city. The furnace is the
largest in Asia. It uses a curved mirror, or an array of mirrors,
acting as a parabolic reflector, which can reach temperatures of up to
3,000 degrees Celsius.  The place for the solar furnace of Uzbekistan
was chosen carefully, because the sun shines there for 270 days a
year"

The psyop has a rich white guy who was culturally Protestan (as most Americans are),

same time ensuring its centrist, rich guy policies are followed. [This photo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FimCFrjWIAMztMt?format=jpg&name=small)

".. ask what you can do for your country" translates to "dont ask for services
from gov" (as Markey brilliantly [used](https://youtu.be/86-3yuzn5UU?t=156) in MA
Senate race), "the rising tide lifts all boats" sounds like trickle-down economics
(in fact some of the WH advisors at the time were actual [proponents](https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-126725)
of the approach). JFK escalated the war in Vietnam, f--ked it all
up in Cuba, and somehow shifted the blame *to the media* with another
statemanly sounding proclamation. It all sounded aw so eloquent
that the retro air is what people remember fondly, rather than
the empty content of the statement itself.

Dems are better off wout the adulation, staning for the Kennedys, it
is holding them back. The soundbytes sound fine enough, but when you

\#Delegation Trip to Austria and Italy! Here are the main take-aways

1) When it comes to decarbonization, the new language is ‚Äúhydrogen‚Äù
(besides \#renewableenergy) üíô

2) \#Hydrogen will partly be transported via pipelines (e.g. European
Hydrogen Backbone Initiative \#EHB) ‚Äì so we must take the right steps
and find the right partners now 

3) The \#energytransition is a joint goal ‚û°Ô∏è only achievable through
international cooperation ‚Äì hydrogen is a perfect example!

4) Our \#LOHC technology = a great solution for transporting
\#greenhydrogen via ship to Italy, where the hydrogen could be injected
into pipelinesüí™ 

And: \#Hydrogen will come from all over the world, so we need all
transport options and act in a #technology-open manner!"

For two teams we can look at their past K games, within that calc goal
avg, passes per minute, bad passes per minute, fouls per minute,
number of completed passes per minute in the attacking 30%/20% of the
field (see how detailed it is), it goes on... Taking such stats for
two teams even eyeballing one can probably gauge a winner. "AI" just
automates that, adds another layer of (let's be honest here) extremely
simple linear regression, and reports a result.

A lot of soccer games can be predictable. If you feed in gazillion of

logistic regression will predict something. There are companies

RFK was ok on some left issues, but fell short... Supported the war in
Vietnam in the beginning, and promised to send 50 fighter jets to
Israel if elected president. That's why that Palestenian assassin was
radicalized and shot him literally one year after the Six-Day War.
Why support the civil right movement but be ok with Palestenians
getting bombed go bits?? Half-assed left - the perennial problem of
America. That is why RFK is dead.
