I never understood the itching for war mentality on the Ukranian side
vis-a-vis Russia. "The other side" of that potential conflict (which
became real) had an apparatus that readied itself for decades to go

Russia's weapons manufacturing, supply lines, preparedness,
stockpiles, the whole thing would be at levels for much greater
conflict and all that preparedness would be dumped *on your head* if
you went to war with them, which is what Ukraine did.

H-Tec Systems presents scalable Hydrogen Cube System..The company
H-Tec Systems from Augsburg presented the Hydrogen Cube System, HCS
for short, to a wider specialist audience at the Hanover Fair 2022...

The Cubes are available both as a closed container solution for
outdoor installation and open for indoor installation. They are
equipped with 18 PEM stacks S450 and integrated process water
treatment and power supply...

<img width="340" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.hzwei.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4-H-TEC_HCS_5-gross.jpg"/>

Several 2 MW cubes of this system can be combined to form a
multi-megawatt system. A system that is intended to achieve 50 MW in
the long term can also be designed in this way. According to H-Tec
Systems, the cubes achieve a system efficiency of 74 percent. They are
equipped with an integrated process water treatment and power
supply. An HCS system with five units, i.e. with an electrolysis
capacity of 10 MW, can therefore produce 4,500 kg of H 2 per day. That
makes 40 to 50 tank fillings for trucks or buses.

That looks massive. Is there anything CSP folks can learn from? They

3K Celcius is a good chunk of energy to generate clean fuel with.

located 45 kilometers away from Tashkent city. The furnace is the
largest in Asia. It uses a curved mirror, or an array of mirrors,
acting as a parabolic reflector, which can reach temperatures of up to
3,000 degrees Celsius.  The place for the solar furnace of Uzbekistan
was chosen carefully, because the sun shines there for 270 days a
year"

2) \#Hydrogen will partly be transported via pipelines (e.g. European
Hydrogen Backbone Initiative \#EHB) – so we must take the right steps
and find the right partners now 

3) The \#energytransition is a joint goal ➡️ only achievable through
international cooperation – hydrogen is a perfect example!

4) Our \#LOHC technology = a great solution for transporting
