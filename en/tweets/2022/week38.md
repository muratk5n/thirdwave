Politico: "Donald Trump‚Äôs top lieutenants are launching a new super
PAC that is expected to spend heavily to bolster his endorsed
candidates in the midterm election ‚Äî and, some people close to the
former president say, could become a campaign apparatus if he runs in
2024... Sanctioned by the former president, the new group, dubbed
MAGA, Inc., will become the primary vehicle for Trump‚Äôs operation to
engage in political activity in 2022"

Guess what, ammonia fixes that problem too.. it can replace hydrofluorocarbons cleanly.

H2 Central: "A Norwegian consortium comprised of four local players,
PSW Power & Automation, Westgass Hydrogen, CCB and H2 Production, has
been established to provide a hydrogen-based shore power solution to
the maritime sector...

'We have shown that our container-based power solutions can be fuelled
by hydrogen, and together with our partners we have demonstrated that
the value chain for such solutions is in place.'

Platform suppliers, cruise ships, drilling rigs and fish farms that
rely heavily on diesel generators can each consume the equivalent of
the power requirement of 400 to 500 houses for their onboard
operations.

Connecting to onshore power supply when docking at ports and shipyards
is a preferred solution to reduce emissions, but CCB said it is facing
significant challenges in meeting demand due to capacity constraints
in the electricity grid"

There - we see a turbulent area but it is localized and there is a
certain pattern to its outer edges. Capture that, in most cases would
not be a need to know all of the internal details.

---

Turbulence, randomness.. how was randomness used? Calculating detailed
aero (to see all details of turbulence) is costly. With usual methods
one represents turbulence statistically, allowing controlled
randomness in the model, eg one says "I'll treat turbulent parts as a
blob, I dont care about the internal details of that blob but I'll
keep track of its location, maybe its size"... That could improve
calculations, turb is roughly accounted for, no need to process it in
detail, the rest of the computation in non-turbulent areas benefit
too.

In addition, the [JP] Sixth Strategic Energy Plan.. states that
ammonia-fueled power generation is one of the most promising options
for decarbonizing power sources toward achieving carbon neutrality by
2050 since it does not emit CO2 during combustion and can be utilized
in many existing power generation facilities such as boilers and
denitration facilities without modification.

Last year, Woodside, JOGMEC, Marubeni, Hokuriku Electric, and Kansai
Electric conducted a feasibility study on the entire supply chain,
including the production of lower emissions ammonia in Australia from
natural gas with CO2 abatement methods such as Carbon Capture and
Storage (CCS), Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU), and
biosequestration; marine transportation to Japan; ammonia‚Äôs
utilization as a fuel for power generation and marine use; and

The Atlantic: "The Hobbit King.. Charles III is far more interested in
the benefits of traditional English hedgerows than the great, global
glory of Britain.

Far from resisting such royal parochialism, Britain should embrace
Charles as the emblem of its new normal age. Very few people in the
world know the names of the Dutch, Danish, or Norwegian monarchs, but
their citizens are much more prosperous and their kingdoms more
settled. If Charles joins them in comparative anonymity, that should
be celebrated.

In 1962, a decade into Britain‚Äôs second Elizabethan age, the American
grandee Dean Acheson caused real hurt and anger in London by declaring
that Britain had lost an empire but had yet to find a role. The entire
reign of Elizabeth was filled with her chief ministers searching for
the answer to this challenge. But with her passing, Britain can cease
its search.¬†Not¬†playing a central role in the great game is a
perfectly noble aspiration, a liberating opportunity‚Äîand one that King
Charles is well suited to symbolize"

[M]any people understand degrowth.. as a call for austerity and a
trigger of recession. In reality, degrowth is just the opposite.

To begin with, austerity is always imposed for the sake of growth. We
have been convinced, for half a century now, that cutting public
services is good for us because it will increase competitiveness,
balance the budget, and eventually lead to growth. Degrowth, by
contrast, is the argument that we can, and should, move away from an
economy that exclusively depends on economic growth"

BTW "described statistically as a random process" was done to compute
faster (they surely know the process isn't random). For fluid dynamics
we have the equations that describe the whole process.. But while
simulating turbulance, need fine detail, and that becomes
computationally costly, in some cases nearly intractable.

What these guys did was finding patterns within turbulence so it could
be computed efficiently. Every model is a summary, a shortcut, they
found a shortcut within the shortcut.

---

Turbulence is deterministic, of course.. that surprises exactly noone
who took a Nonlinear Dynamics course.

"[P]hysicists [of Gatech] have demonstrated ‚Äî numerically and
experimentally ‚Äî that turbulence can be understood and quantified with
the help of a relatively small set of special solutions to the
governing equations of fluid dynamics that can be precomputed for a
particular geometry, once and for all.

'For nearly a century, turbulence has been described statistically as
a random process,' said [scientist]. 'Our results provide the first
experimental illustration that, on suitably short time scales, the
dynamics of turbulence is deterministic ‚Äî and connects it to the
underlying deterministic governing equations.'"
