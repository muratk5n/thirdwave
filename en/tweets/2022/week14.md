Fermilab physics video below. Summary: Mass is an illusion. Proton,
neutrons are the shit. Higgs Boson is not a big deal.

TDB: "IBM’s Watson, who trounced the greatest Jeopardy! players on the
classic game show—but needed to be hard-wired to the show’s
question-posing system. He was incapable of doing an autonomous task
that any three-year-old could do: listening for the host to finish a
question before buzzing in"

Sounds like bunch of unnecessary pain.. Test based restrictions are
excessive.. Left over policy from beginning of pandemic.

TDB: "On the day my wife and I were to fly home from London after a
brief visit, we took a COVID-19 test.. My wife’s test was negative. My
test was positive. She flew out.... So I was looking at 10 days of
hotels, which are not cheap in London. It’s not as if I can call a
friend here and say, “Hey, I got covid. Can I crash on your living
room sofa?”

[Gets covid] My symptoms quickly went away, and after four days I felt
fine again... But, now, how do I get back? Here’s the problem. There
is a chance that some little piece of the virus remains in my body. So
if I take another test and it’s positive, I’m stuck here again—with no
symptoms except a bleeding wallet"

CNBC: "Charlie Munger warns Gen Z investors.. 'It’s going to be way
harder for the group that’s graduated from college now ... to get rich
and stay rich,' Munger, 98, said. 'Think what it [used to] cost to own
a house in a desirable neighborhood in a city like Los Angeles.'"

Besides the need to provide bed-time stories for their shoddy
nation-building, Asia Minor Turkist propaganda was useful for British
interests; they could use it as a cudgel for the continuation of the
Great Game in Asia, eg if you can create an illusion of unity between
TR and "the Stans", some of which are "ethnically similar", u could
then be provoke those countries against their immediate neighbor.

But the act is getting old.. Plus TR's problems compound whose very
foundation was crooked (that's what you get with second rate
founders). People live in a bastardized world of their true culture
which is incompatible with national narrative that constantly leads
them astray, or at best, keeps them stagnant which is the case today
(middle-income trap).

Because US was caught doing undemocratic shit, its protests on the
Egyptian coup registered less. The revelations might have even given
Sisi the PR cover he needed for the coup.

Timeline reminder

June 2013: An NSA contractor Edward Snowden starts sharing gov secrets
with the media. Americans learn that their government was spying
broadly on its own people.

July 2013: A military coup in Egypt removes President Morsi from
power.

Looking at the map, Philippines would be key for the outers to contain
China.. But what happens after Duterte?

"U.S., Philippines Hold One of Their Largest-Ever Military Exercises"

Orban wins again. He is lambasted on immigration, but on process we
have to accept forcing countries to accept new people if their
democratically elected government does not agree would be
undemocratic.

---

FT: "China has reaffirmed its partnership with Russia in the wake of
the Ukraine invasion and says it wants to push bilateral relations 'to
a higher level'"

---

NYT: "Syrian mercenaries deploy to Russia en route to Ukrainian
battlefields Hundreds of Syrian fighters are en route to join Russian
forces in Ukraine, effectively returning the favour to Moscow for
helping President Bashar Assad crush rebels in an 11-year civil war,
according to two people monitoring the flow of mercenaries"

---

Moldova is NATO-friendly? If they were opportunistic they would give
Russia access for Western Ukraine in return for Odessa Oblast.

---

TBH Ukraine had ownership of some prime land that was beyond its
capacity to hold onto. They needed massive deterrence, or major
forsight on diplomacy to make self less threathening to others
(RU). Ukraine had neither.

---

Moldova was screwed, historically speaking; had zero sea access until
2005, now have a *tiny* port, and had to trade land with Ukraine to
get it. Reminds me the bitch borders of Iraq drawn up by Western
powers..  Sad.

In a natural evolution of borders Moldova would have the land reaching
all the way to the Black Sea, areas currently belong to Ukraine.

Immediate UKR south is in danger being closed off to sea access for
Ukraine. No wonder Odessa is being attacked.

---

The map suggests a possible region for attack would be that pocket
shown with arrow, and yes, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Lysychansk,
Kreminna, Hirske, Popasna Berezove, Toshkivka - all being shelled. If
RU takes the region the red block will get bigger.

MSM is not even providing Liveuamap level reporting here. See the red
regions in the map. Those are RU areas; not newsworthy?

Watching the corporate media you'd think Ukraine is winning big, if
there was just some extra hardware, they'd finish the war today

Sri Lanka has massive solar potential with mad DNI. They could be
generating renewable fuel instead they are in queues waiting for
fossil. 

---

They had a seperatist group Tamil Tigers.. A coworker of mine was from
Sri Lanka and Tamil Tiger symphatizer. The group was defeated later, I
looked it up now, in 2009, with 40,000 ethnic Tamils dead throughout
the conflict. Is Sri Lanka getting some karma blowback here?

"How Sri Lanka Has Fallen Into Darkness..

April is the hottest month in Sri Lanka. Just unbelievably hot, like a
fever that doesn’t break until the rains. Heat makes everybody cranky,
irritable, and I suppose violent. April is the cruelest month, as they
say.  This is the worst April in Sri Lanka’s history. I don’t mean
that worse things haven’t happened—we’ve had pogroms, a tsunami,
various insurrections, a good thirty years of war—I just mean this
catastrophe is happening to all of Sri Lanka, all at once. No one is
safe from this disaster. It affects every single home.  At a very
fundamental level, the island has just fallen into the sea...

Why did this happen? Many reasons, and one family (the Rajapaksas).
Sri Lanka was an ancient irrigation civilization and in modern times
50% of our electricity comes from water (hydro). However, after
‘liberalizing’ in the 1980s we stopped building anything
useful. Instead we built giant generators that burn fucking oil for
the rest of our needs. This has been a farce forever. Now it’s a
tragedy.  Now we’re run out of oil for this generator, foreign capital
flows have dried up, and the whole thing has been managed
abysmally. The ruling family’s elder brother ran up the credit card a
decade ago and now the younger brother is paying off those commercial
bank loans instead of providing for our families.  And so the entire
country has blackouts, every day, for hours at a time. The entire
country waits in petrol and diesel queues"

A good summary on how the world soured on the dollar, bit by bit, even
the Europeans (after DJT Iran deal cancellation).

There is a sequel too.. In this one Bruce Wayne decides to lobby the
government for his tax dollars to be spent more on social help, less
on stop-and-frisk bust-head-and-crack-skull approach mostly used in
Gotham. The sequel is titled "*Batman: Defunding the Police*". It
works, Joker, Two-Face get bored after a while, they declare they wont
show up for the whole trilogy, or even the prequels. 

---

Batman movies could be much shorter.. Bruce Wayne sees lots of crime,
then he thinks about what to do.. he think.. thinks.. while the camera
moves closer; the last scene is a near shot on BW when he says "I
guess I should pay my taxes". Done. The movie ends.

---

The saddest part in the Batman movies is when they lit up that 'bat
sign', essentially making city gov look like bufoons; the
establishment sales pitch here is "wouldn't an ultra-rich twat be
better to save your ass then the elected government?"

The gun is symbolism for a dick basically

Damn Clint! (at the end). He probably feels different about that stuff
