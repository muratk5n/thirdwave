Simple fuel, projectile, molecule based approach is much better than
bitch-electric, bitch-magnet, bitch-laser approaches. Heat, pressure,
mass, molecules, protons, neutrons - these form the crux of what's out
there, ie reality.

"First Light is taking a unique projectile fusion approach to solve
[the] challenge, which it believes offers the fastest, simplest and
cheapest route to commercial fusion power. This means that instead of
using complex and expensive lasers or magnets to generate or maintain
the conditions for fusion, First Light‚Äôs approach compresses the fuel
inside a target using a projectile travelling at tremendous speed"

CNBC: "Key people from the Fed just spooked the markets - here's what
they said.. Fed Governor Lael Brainard and San Francisco Fed President
Mary Daly both issued comments that showed they both envision higher
rates and, in the former's case, an aggressive drawdown of the assets
the central bank is holding on its balance sheet..

Investors didn't particularly like what they heard, sending major
averages considerably lower on the day"

T. Frank: "Frederick Dutton, Democratic Party power
broker.. identified workers, the core of the New Deal coalition, as
'the principal group arrayed against the forces of change'... The
culture in those years was saturated with depictions of blue-collar
bigots doing scary things like shooting the main characters in Easy
Rider and rioting in support of the Vietnam War...

Still, a man like Dutton should have known better. A glance at the
union placards carried by marchers at Martin Luther King‚Äôs 1963 March
on Washington ‚Äîor at the way the United Auto Workers lobbied for the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 ‚Äîor at the 1968 strike of black sanitation
workers in Memphis‚Äîshould have been enough to suggest that the Archie
Bunker stereotype was not the whole story. Besides, what kind of
Democrat gives up on basic economic issues in order to focus on
matters of 'the psyche' and 'the soul'? This was not politics; it was
psychotherapy. Worse: it was aristocratic hauteur disguised as
enlightenment"

Why not? The job may not involve high skill but there is clearly a
demand for it.

"Truck drivers should not make the same amt of money as software
developer"

---

Are they unionized? They could push for workplace rules.

Rollling Stone (via Jon Oliver): "There are about 3.5 million truck
drivers in America, yet trucking companies have long claimed there‚Äôs a
shortage of drivers that threatens to derail ‚Äî OK, further derail ‚Äî
the supply chain. Except, the actual problem isn‚Äôt too few truckers,
it‚Äôs too few truckers willing to put up with all the terrible bullshit
truckers are forced to put up with"

Subtract imports from GDP (to see locally produced goods with locally
worked hours), divided total hours worked with it - gives numbers of
hours worked per unit GDP. Ratio has been decreasing for the past 70
years.

The reason for that decrease IMO is either technology, or too much
efficiency is being squeezed out of employees at the expense
of.. something. Wages? Maybe at Amazon you won't be allowed to take a
bathroom break?

principle, every unsaturated compound (organic molecules with C-C

H2 View: "France has recently announced a ‚Ç¨7bn package to build a
carbon-free hydrogen industry. Germany issued a similar program of
‚Ç¨9bn and that has intensified as their reliance on Russian gas is
threatened. In July, the European Commission said it is looking to
increase its production capacity of electrolysers from 250MW today to
40GW in 2030. Similar strategies have been released by the UK,
Australia, and Asian countries. These are just some of the most recent
announcements, but they show a clear trend towards massive public
investments in the sector"

---

Businesswire: "Locosoco pleased to announce discussions are underway
with Proton Technologies, a leader in the field of Clean Hydrogen
Production that utilises existing fossil fuel infrastructure.. Proton
Technologies [tech creates] carbon-free, low-cost opportunity for
extracting hydrogen using previously expensed infrastructure and known
energy deposits.. [which allows] extraction of clean hydrogen whilst
sequestering carbon within existing oil wells"

---

We could complement the transition with CCS. Many green advocates are
fine with blue H2 generated from natgas with carbon capture (of course
solar is preferable). People who lobby, produce lit on this stuff need
to laser focus on proper engineering, and costs.

Report: "Greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by 43% and methane
by about a third by 2030 that can only happen if countries reduce
their dependence on fossil fuels and replace it with renewable energy"

Maybe Japan should have just condemned Harry Truman for his war crimes

I know Abdul is a Trekkie (had a cameo on Voyager) nothing particularly against him

The backdrop changed of course throughout the Craig era; there was the
2008 crisis, failures in Iraq, Syria, refugees, more crisis.. Surely
these effected the mood later.

---

*Bourne Identity*, the first movie in the series, isn't exactly a post
9/11 movie. It was written, filmed 1999/2000, due to delays it hit the
theathers 2002. That is clear to see in the content; plus the director
Liman's father was Senate chief counsel on the Iran-Contra affair, so
he was making a movie around that stuff, shady biz, underhanded
spycraft etc. Later two Bourne movies are different.

---

*Casino Royale* was a good action movie, no arguments there.

---

After many globetrotting adventures (an "outer belt" hero, Master of
all Faraway Lands) 9/11 Bond died near European landmass, after
fighting a foe played by an ethnically Egyptian actor.

---

The 9/11 Bond, "James Blonde", has died. It's interesting the first
major action scene has Bond killing, beating on colored people in a
Caribbean setting. Post 9/11 Jason Bourne would soon follow suit.

Arabs aren't black but hey, close enough, they just found the nearest
non-white folk and beat up on them. Fureigners, A-rabs and the like,
you've been warned.

:) James Bond's grave at Faroe Islands

Spoiler: the last movie has Bond die there. The island now uses it as

The migration that resulted due to the partition was especially bad
with deaths reaching up to a million. That too is on the Brits.

Al Jazeera: Before leaving India [1947], the British made sure a
united India would not be possible... East and West Pakistan were
hacked off the stooped shoulders of India by the departing
British.. Within months, India and Pakistan were embroiled in a war
over Kashmir, the consequences of which still affect us today. The
creation and perpetuation of Hindu-Muslim antagonism was the most
significant accomplishment of British imperial policy: the colonial
project of 'divide et impera' (divide and rule) fomented religious
antagonisms to facilitate continued imperial rule"

---

Kashmir? Britain's fault

---

It makes sense for Pak to get buddy-buddy w China, Russia; since India
rels are always on the rocks. Cant blame a guy for wanting friends,
energy deals, ports and roads for his country.

Sounds like bunch of unnecessary pain.. Test based restrictions are
excessive.. Left over policy from beginning of pandemic.

TDB: "On the day my wife and I were to fly home from London after a
brief visit, we took a COVID-19 test.. My wife‚Äôs test was negative. My
test was positive. She flew out.... So I was looking at 10 days of
hotels, which are not cheap in London. It‚Äôs not as if I can call a
friend here and say, ‚ÄúHey, I got covid. Can I crash on your living
room sofa?‚Äù

[Gets covid] My symptoms quickly went away, and after four days I felt
fine again... But, now, how do I get back? Here‚Äôs the problem. There
is a chance that some little piece of the virus remains in my body. So
if I take another test and it‚Äôs positive, I‚Äôm stuck here again‚Äîwith no
symptoms except a bleeding wallet"

CNBC: "Charlie Munger warns Gen Z investors.. 'It‚Äôs going to be way

a house in a desirable neighborhood in a city like Los Angeles.'"

---

Besides the need to provide bed-time stories for their shoddy
nation-building, Asia Minor Turkist propaganda was useful for British
interests; they could use it as a cudgel for the continuation of the
Great Game in Asia, eg if you can create an illusion of unity between
TR and "the Stans", some of which are "ethnically similar", u could
then be provoke those countries against their immediate neighbor.

But the act is getting old.. Plus TR's problems compound whose very
foundation was crooked (that's what you get with second rate
founders). People live in a bastardized world of their true culture
which is incompatible with national narrative that constantly leads
them astray, or at best, keeps them stagnant which is the case today
(middle-income trap).

---

Moldova is NATO-friendly? If they were opportunistic they would give
Russia access for Western Ukraine in return for Odessa Oblast.

---

TBH Ukraine had ownership of some prime land that was beyond its
capacity to hold onto. They needed massive deterrence, or major
forsight on diplomacy to make self less threathening to others
(RU). Ukraine had neither.

---

Moldova was screwed, historically speaking; had zero sea access until
2005, now have a *tiny* port, and had to trade land with Ukraine to
get it. Reminds me the bitch borders of Iraq drawn up by Western
powers..  Sad.

In a natural evolution of borders Moldova would have the land reaching
all the way to the Black Sea, areas currently belong to Ukraine.

Immediate UKR south is in danger being closed off to sea access for

Kreminna, Hirske, Popasna Berezove, Toshkivka - all being shelled. If

"How Sri Lanka Has Fallen Into Darkness..

April is the hottest month in Sri Lanka. Just unbelievably hot, like a
fever that doesn‚Äôt break until the rains. Heat makes everybody cranky,
irritable, and I suppose violent. April is the cruelest month, as they
say.  This is the worst April in Sri Lanka‚Äôs history. I don‚Äôt mean
that worse things haven‚Äôt happened‚Äîwe‚Äôve had pogroms, a tsunami,
various insurrections, a good thirty years of war‚ÄîI just mean this
catastrophe is happening to all of Sri Lanka, all at once. No one is
safe from this disaster. It affects every single home.  At a very
fundamental level, the island has just fallen into the sea...

Why did this happen? Many reasons, and one family (the Rajapaksas).
Sri Lanka was an ancient irrigation civilization and in modern times
50% of our electricity comes from water (hydro). However, after
‚Äòliberalizing‚Äô in the 1980s we stopped building anything
useful. Instead we built giant generators that burn fucking oil for
the rest of our needs. This has been a farce forever. Now it‚Äôs a
tragedy.  Now we‚Äôre run out of oil for this generator, foreign capital
flows have dried up, and the whole thing has been managed
abysmally. The ruling family‚Äôs elder brother ran up the credit card a
decade ago and now the younger brother is paying off those commercial
bank loans instead of providing for our families.  And so the entire
country has blackouts, every day, for hours at a time. The entire
country waits in petrol and diesel queues"

There is a sequel too.. In this one Bruce Wayne decides to lobby the
government for his tax dollars to be spent more on social help, less
on stop-and-frisk bust-head-and-crack-skull approach mostly used in
Gotham. The sequel is titled "*Batman: Defunding the Police*". It
works, Joker, Two-Face get bored after a while, they declare they wont
show up for the whole trilogy, or even the prequels. 

---

Batman movies could be much shorter.. Bruce Wayne sees lots of crime,
then he thinks about what to do.. he think.. thinks.. while the camera
moves closer; the last scene is a near shot on BW when he says "I
guess I should pay my taxes". Done. The movie ends.

---

The saddest part in the Batman movies is when they lit up that 'bat
sign', essentially making city gov look like bufoons; the
establishment sales pitch here is "wouldn't an ultra-rich twat be
better to save your ass then the elected government?"
