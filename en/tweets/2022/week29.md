Renew Economy: "'Eureka moment' as Australian researchers make
hydrogen storage breakthrough.. A team from Deakin University‚Äôs
Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM) in Melbourne says it has found
a new mechanochemical way of separating and storing gases, which is
safe, uses a tiny fraction of the energy compared to traditional
methods and creates zero waste.

The hero ingredient in the breakthrough is boron nitride powder, which
is has a knack for absorbing substances, being small, but with a large
amount of surface area. It‚Äôs also classed as a ‚Äúlevel-0 chemical,‚Äù
something that is deemed perfectly safe to have in your house.

The researchers put boron nitride powder into a ball mill ‚Äì a type of
grinder containing small stainless-steel balls in a chamber ‚Äì along
with the gases that need to be separated.

As the chamber rotates at a higher and higher speed, the balls collide
with the powder and the wall of the chamber triggers a mechanochemical
reaction resulting in gas being absorbed into the powder.

One type of gas is absorbed quicker, separating it out from the
others, and allowing it to be easily removed from the mill. The
process can be repeated over several stages to separate the gases one
by one.

<img width="200" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FX9zA-MWAAAxXrO?format=jpg&name=small"/>

All up, the process consumes 76.8 KJ/s to store and separate 1000L of
gases, which means it uses at least 90 per cent less than the current
gas separation process commonly used in the petroluem industry...

Even more significantly, once the gas is absorbed into the powder it
gas can be transported safely and easily. When the gas is needed, the
powder can be simply heated in a vacuum to release the gas unchanged...

[The team shows] there‚Äôs mechanochemical alternative, using ball
milling to store gas in the nanomaterial at room temperature. It
doesn‚Äôt require high pressure or low temperatures, so it would offer a
much cheaper and safer way to develop things like hydrogen powered
vehicles.

The next step for the IFM team is to gather industry support and scale
the process up to a full pilot. A provisional patent application has
been submitted for the process"

H2 Central: "SoCalGas launches green hydrogen storage pilot project in
the US.. For this new pilot project, SoCalGas is collaborating with
GKN Hydrogen, a green hydrogen producer from Bonn, Germany, as well as
with the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)..

The US Department of Energy (DoE) has provided 1.7 million in funding
and SoCalGas has provided additional support including $400,000. The
pilot will bring together two of GKN Hydrogen‚Äôs HY2MEGA H2 storage
subsystems with 500 kilograms of capacity for H2 storage...

The green H2 will be stored in a solid state under low pressure in
HY2MEGA hydrogen storage tank, which is a modular metal hydride
technology solution which has been under development for about ten
years"

If coal gasification can generate natural gas, can that be fed into
methane pyrolysis to generate clean gas? There are other methods for
H2 generation from coal with CCS of course.

Missing ratings on either side are not a problem (most ppl dont watch
everything so they are many). In sparse matrix format missing vals are
not stored, dot product calculation is smart enough to skip them and
treat them as zero. If nothing matched dot product gives a zero which
is cosine of 90. You are at 90 degrees to this person, "orthogonal",
at odds shall we say - no matches.  I don't pick that person's movies
for recommendation. The whole thing is calculated is pretty fast
actually.

---

I use "cosine distance" to find users that are similar to my picks. My
mov ratings are in one vector, someone else's in another, similarity
amounts to a "dot product" essentially.

Monolith cleanly produces essential materials including hydrogen and

U.S. manufacturer to produce clean hydrogen using methane pyrolysis at
scale.

This innovation attracted worldwide attention, prompting organizations
like SK to sign a memorandum of understanding last October with
Monolith to produce clean hydrogen and carbon black in South Korea. It
also generated a collaboration agreement and letter of intent with The
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company late in 2021...

The company has attracted the interest of numerous high-profile clean
energy investors and recently received conditional approval for a more

Try sending electricity from UAE to Japan. That would be a pretty

Article prefaced that comment with 'still' assuming both previous
projects listed were not related to oil and gas? The clean ammonia
project was blue ammonia, meaning it was generated from natgas + CCUS.

Al Monitor: "[R]ecently, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company sent the
experimental energy form clean ammonia to Japan. In May, the Emirati
renewable energy company Masdar unveiled a plant that turns garbage
into energy. Still, gas and oil remain integral to the Emirati economy"

---

Al Monitor: "Clean ammonia from Abu Dhabi has made its way to
Japan.. [said] The Japanese oil company Inpex... The ammonia was made
via natural gas from ADNOC‚Äôs Fertiglobe joint venture with the Dutch
chemical company OCI...

Ammonia is a compound of hydrogen and nitrogen that can be used as
fuel. Blue ammonia refers to ammonia that is derived from hydrogen in
natural gas. Green ammonia is produced using green hydrogen, which is
made from renewable energy. So-called 'clean ammonia' comprises both
blue and green.. ammonia from Abu Dhabi is ‚Äúclean‚Äù because the carbon
dioxide emitted from the ammonia production process was 'sequestered
and injected into Abu Dhabi onshore oil fields,' meaning it was not
released into the atmosphere"

Hubble tension.. When you assign a new term to ignorance all of a
sudden it sounds scientific. Why dont you say *we dont know what the
fuck is going on here*

"Multiple methods have been used to determine the Hubble
constant. 'Late universe' measurements using calibrated distance
ladder techniques have converged on a value of approximately 73
km/s/Mpc. Since 2000, 'early universe' techniques based on
measurements of the cosmic microwave background have become available,
and these agree on a value near 67.7 km/s/Mpc. (This is accounting for
the change in the expansion rate since the early universe, so is
comparable to the first number.) As techniques have improved, the
estimated¬†measurement uncertainties have shrunk, but the range of
measured values has not, to the point that the disagreement is now
highly statistically significant. This discrepancy is called the
Hubble tension"

Is US in recession? Econ defines it as two consecutive quarters of neg

already -1.57%. Guesstimate for last Q, from FRED (the
so-called GDPNow number) is

```python
import util; df = util.get_fred(2021,"GDPNOW"); df.tail(1)

DATE              
2022-04-01 -1.5245

the last quarter comes out.

Davis: "Supporting Ukraine For ‚ÄòAs Long As It Takes‚Äô Is Not A Strategy..

Russia was presumed to require an operational pause after taking
Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in late June, but current evidence
suggests that, to the contrary, Moscow has kept the pressure on the
Ukrainian defenders. When the Ukrainian troops withdrew from
Lysychansk, they repositioned along a new line of defense,
north-to-south from Seversk, to Soledar, to Bahkmut.

As of Thursday, Russian and Western media were reporting that Russian
troops were already in the outskirts of Seversk, and within a few
miles of both Soledar and Bahkmut ‚Äì and all three are receiving
withering artillery and rocket fire, along with air strikes. Once
Russian forces break through this new line of defense, the twin-cities
of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk lie barely 25 miles to the west. The
Ukrainian troops would be hard-pressed to put up a successful defense
of either, as Russia could drive the attack with its forces from three
sides"
