"[Oz state] NSW won’t support further offshore mining and exploration
permits"

---

Reuters: "The German government has announced that it intends to
transfer hydrogen production technology to countries in Africa. This
strategy is meant to work with Germany’s strategy to eliminate its
reliance on coal and nuclear energy. To replace nuclear and coal,
Germany will have to import about 40 to 60 percent of the H2 it will
need... The announcement was made by an official from the German
government who explained the country’s intentions just ahead of a
meeting between the European Union and the African Union that took
place in Brussels"

player in the world of hydrogen, plans have been unveiled for a
gigawatt-scale green fuels hub – and it could produce green hydrogen
in volumes not yet seen in the US... Apex Clean Energy is behind the
ambitious plans, having inked a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with
the Port of Corpus Christi Authority and EPIC Midstream"

Trump's talk on NATO's irrelevance might have helped to quell RU fears
on issues related to Ukraine.. But WH did sell anti-tank weapons to
UKR in 2019.

The Independent: "Russia conflict separates GOP traditionalists from
newcomers.. Divisions in a rapidly changing Republican Party are
evident in the divergent responses to the tensions in Ukraine"

---

Jane's Defense: "US deploying ground and air-attack assets to Baltic region"

---

Yeea why not.. invade Ukraine. He doesn't even see them as a f-ing
country. So by implication they cannot govern themselves, so you step
in.

The Independent: "Putin declares war on Ukraine and warns foreign
powers of ‘consequences’ if they interfere.. US president Joe Biden
says US and allies will respond in ‘decisive way’"

---

UKR gov is no more Nazi then the Kremlin is Eskimo.

---

Nazis? 🤨 That's stupid. Only makes sense as propaganda.. it aims to
mobilize RU by conjuring up memories of their last great victory --
against Nazis.

The Guardian: "Russian forces have unleashed an attack of Ukraine
.. [RU claims] it was for the “demilitarisation and denazification” of
Ukraine, echoing a theme of Kremlin propaganda, the false claim that
the Kyiv government is controlled by the far right"

---

CNBC: "The case for bitcoin as ‘digital gold’ is falling
apart. Bitcoin fell to a two-week low Tuesday after Russia ordered

Viacom CBS stock. Major fail started in 2017. Which event could be the
trigger?

Ah, I have it. Star Trek Discovery -- playfully called by many Trek

U-oh.. be careful lets not become too relevant now

"UN slams 'aggressive' formula milk marketing"

---

I calculated Nodstream 2 to be at 1 GW capacity. That's one nuclear
plant, that's it, nothing that can turn everything upside down. NS2's
significance was more symbolic than in substance. It bypasses Ukraine
so there was a message there. Plus the pipeline is new, its shutting
down would not harming existing gas transportation, only future new
transportation. NS2 was mostly a bellwether for Germany's stance
toward Russia.

H2 View: "$127.9m boost for zero emissions vehicles in
Australia.. Unveiled.. by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency
(ARENA) on the behalf of the Australian Government, the Future Fuels
Programme will see funding dedicated to the roll-out of hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles and the supporting infrastructure"

Freaking massive

H2 View: "The Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) has announced
that it is submitting a green hydrogen infrastructure application
to construct an electrolyzer with a capacity between 10GW and 20GW"

---

"As alternative to molten salts-based systems [used by most CSPs],
other energy storage systems are being proposed in the last years
... Limestone, which is the second most abundant material on Earth
after water, can be employed for this purpose. In the so-called
Calcium Looping (CaL) process, direct solar radiation is used to carry
out the endothermic calcination reaction releasing CO2 and CaO as
products that are stored separately. Storage conditions and time
depends on the energy demand. When energy is needed, the stored
products are brought together to carry out the exothermic carbonation
reaction which releases the stored energy"

---

Li-on batteries are limited by world lithium reserves. At its max this
tech can only handle 5% of global storage need. They are doomed to
remain marginal, and eventually irrelevant.

---

Switch to a green econ cannot be accomplished on the backs on bunch of
people "putting up solar panels on their rooftops". That's good, but
not everyone lives in a setting they can do that easily. Green energy
needs to be a product, which can be transmitted easily, and stored as
needed in huge amounts.

---

With all that solar potential there is no reason China should not one
day become energy independent.

---

That sucks for Russia

"@JeremyCliffe

Wow. Scholz has just announced that NordStream 2 will not be certified"

---

"If it aint Boeing I aint going". That used to be a saying? Maybe the
saying changed a little bit recently, no?

---

"Germany will offer its population a new protein-based Covid-19
vaccine comparable to conventional flu jabs this week, in the hope of
swaying a sizeable minority that remains sceptical of the novel mRNA
technology used in the most commonly used vaccines"

---

Mango is potent.. Planning to add it to the veg patty mix. Replaced
marmite with avacado (high on the B vitamins, w fats), added spinach
for lutein (for eyesight longevity). Testing.

"@kachayev

Most likely you're reading my tweets because I'm an engineer, and I
talk a lot about it. But, first and foremost, I'm Ukrainian. And I
just spent an hour of my life listening to the president of another
country ranting about how my country shouldn't exist"

Oz had really locked it all down hadn't it.. This is good

and lovers reunite after 704 days of Covid restrictions"

It matters bcz countries will attempt to pull discussion to bodies
they are part of, and by doing that they might be pushing some
countries out of the discussion. China might steer things to UNSC bcz
it is a permanent member there, away from G7, while Germany might do
the reverse. US, being in both, can pick and choose, select either
format just to freeze out countries that are not in one or the
other. That does not lead to a democratic environment.

UNSC permanent members are basically the victors of WWII; from
long-time ago. A more inclusive org with major teeth is needed. The
new org should also decide on a majority vote basis. If you piss
off more than half the countries, it should mean something.

"Why does membership in UNSC and G7 matter in world matters?'

5 x 1e9 x 33.6 / (365 x 24 x 1e6) computes over 19 Gigawatts of
capacity. Huge.  Equivalent to 19 nuclear plants.

Arab News: "India plans to produce 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen
a year by 2030 as it seeks to exploit low renewable energy costs to
become a global exporter of the sustainable fuel... The target was
announced by India’s power ministry on Thursday as it revealed the
first part of its national hydrogen policy"

No wonder Blackrock is world's largest asset manager; LF has a good
nose for promising opportunities. Unlike some 'genius' investors who
merely rode the wave of FOMO, faux-unicorns made possible thanks to
low rates, this guy pinpointed a fundamental, game changing tech
early. That is skill.

H2 View: "Hydrogen refuelling network to be developed in the
US by Daimler Truck, NextEra and BlackRock"

CNBC: "[Oct 2021] Larry Fink, the CEO and Chairman of Blackrock, sees
addressing climate change as a massive potential for new
businesses. 'It is my belief that the next 1,000 unicorns — companies
that have a market valuation over a billion dollars — won't be a
search engine, won't be a media company, they'll be businesses
developing green hydrogen, green agriculture, green steel and green
cement,' Fink said Monday at the Middle East Green Initiative Summit
in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"

Look at that [bad boy](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMA3m-DWUAMDe-D?format=jpg&name=small).
Arrrr.. The wind cannot knock this down!

---

Electric cables are an inefficient way of transporting energy. Strong
winds can damage wires easily. A clean gas pipeline is very close or
under the ground, and a robust construction, would not be harmed by
adverse weather easily. Also transmits power 10 times faster at 8th
the cost.

JFK "Eternal Flame"? They have this bloody gas powered thing burning
since the 60s, non-stop. Need to put that shit out. The mucker was
undeserving for that gesture for one, and it is emitting GHG.

---

Pollution (air, sea -oil spills-) is enough to entice a switch to
green fuels. Green fuel pipeline instead of oil pipeline would have
saved California's beaches just the previous year.

Need to transition to discussing climate solutions rather than
expanding 'awareness' on climate change. Some solutions can garner
broad support, and have good economics behind them. The new bidness
possibilities can overcome (!) a lot of doubts.
