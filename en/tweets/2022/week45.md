ABC AU: "Andrew Forrest says big companies are 'forcing' customers to
'destroy the planet.. "All I'm saying to the fossil fuel sector is, if
you're like the single-use plastic sector, if you're like Coca-Cola
and you just give single-use plastic as your container for Coke, then
you're forcing your customers to be single-use plastic nature
destroyers".. Coca-Cola is one of the sponsors for the UN Climate
Change Conference â€” a move which has drawn criticism from climate
activists..

Mr Forrest is investing in solar farms to lay the groundwork for
Fortescue Future Industries to be producing 15 million tonnes of green
hydrogen by 2030"

Leary, *Pharmageddon*: "On the surface medical practice appears the
same but underneath itâ€™s not. For instance, a small number of people
have a genetic disorder that leads to excessively high cholesterol
levels and for them drugs like the statins can save lives.. For the
most part, however, the statins are instead given to healthy people
who have mild elevations of their cholesterol levels. Similarly,
treatments for asthma or osteoporosis are now given to many people who
would never have been diagnosed and treated before.  Treatment happens
now in response to results on a series of tests that have emerged in
recent yearsâ€”but these new tests donâ€™t help make a diagnosis that will
lift a threat to our lives. Instead they effectively make a diagnosis
of some drug deficiency disorder, and they often enter medical
practice as part of the marketing strategy for a new drug.

These new diseases and their treatments have gained a purchase on us
because they are presumed to represent the latest advances in a story
of progress that runs through insulin and the antibiotics and will
hopefully lead someday to cures for cancer. These are the drugs that,
had they been available, some presume might have saved many of my
fatherâ€™s generation. But far from saving either their lives or ours,
clinical trials show that the indiscriminate use of drugs to lower
lipids or blood sugars, to relieve respiratory wheeze, or to block
stress hormones may even increase the risk of loss of life, and appear
to be doing so in the United States, the country that makes the
greatest use of the latest pharmaceuticals, where since the mid-1970s
life expectancy has been falling progressively further behind other
developed countries"

continued dedication to advancing the nationâ€™s green hydrogen
economy...

Cummins plans to dedicate 89,000 square feet of its existing Fridley
[MN] plant to electrolyzer production. Initially, the facility will
manufacture its HyLYZERÂ®-500 and HyLYZERÂ®-5000 proton exchange
membrane (PEM) electrolyzers here, with the potential to manufacture
other electrolyzer products in the future.

This range of products can accommodate power needs from 1.25MW to more

projects"

BTW the vid below talks about nuclear waste; but it turns out using

and I've seen articles about US, France facilities. This tech should
be more widespread.

More science fail 

Kroupa: "Dark Matter Doesn't Exist.. The current cosmological model
only works by postulating the existence of dark matter â€“ a substance
that has never been detected, but that is supposed to constitute
approximately 25% of all the universe. But a simple test suggests that
dark matter does not in fact exist. If it did, we would expect lighter
galaxies orbiting heavier ones to be slowed down by dark matter
particles, but we detect no such slow-down. A host of other
observational tests support the conclusion: dark matter is not
there. The implications of this are nothing short of a revision of
Einsteinâ€™s theory of gravitation. Why the scientific community is in
denial about the falsification of the dark matter model is a question
that requires both a sociological and philosophical explanation"
