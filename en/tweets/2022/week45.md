The increased competiteness would help if UK did not cut itself off
from their BIGGEST EXPORT MARKET.

CNBC: "A historically weaker pound on a medium- to long-term basis has
a variety of impacts on the U.K. more broadly...  The most basic one
is that imports get more expensive, while exports theoretically get
more competitive"

infrastructure ecosystem qualifies to come into the.. program to be
repurposed,' [said..] head of DOE’s Loan Programs Office. '[The
program] can help replace coal plants with clean energy, switch gas
pipelines to hydrogen, upgrade transmission, and more.'"

H2 Central: "Global Power Leader Cummins Inc. will begin producing
electrolyzers in the United States, underscoring the company’s
continued dedication to advancing the nation’s green hydrogen
economy...

Cummins plans to dedicate 89,000 square feet of its existing Fridley
[MN] plant to electrolyzer production. Initially, the facility will
manufacture its HyLYZER®-500 and HyLYZER®-5000 proton exchange
membrane (PEM) electrolyzers here, with the potential to manufacture
other electrolyzer products in the future.

This range of products can accommodate power needs from 1.25MW to more
than 200MW for both small- and large-scale hydrogen generation
projects"

Dems post-2016 were also "election-deniers" weren't they? They blamed

BTW the vid below talks about nuclear waste; but it turns out using
spent (MOX) fuel is feasible. Russia now [has a
plant](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Beloyarsk-BN-800-fast-reactor-running-on-MOX),
and I've seen articles about US, France facilities. This tech should
be more widespread.

It’s easy to defeat the global propagandists nowadays; they’re overstretched.

They don’t know against whom they should spread their lies: Muslims?

Their propaganda machine is spread too thin & ineffective"

More science fail 

Kroupa: "Dark Matter Doesn't Exist.. The current cosmological model
only works by postulating the existence of dark matter – a substance
that has never been detected, but that is supposed to constitute
approximately 25% of all the universe. But a simple test suggests that
dark matter does not in fact exist. If it did, we would expect lighter
galaxies orbiting heavier ones to be slowed down by dark matter
particles, but we detect no such slow-down. A host of other
observational tests support the conclusion: dark matter is not
there. The implications of this are nothing short of a revision of
Einstein’s theory of gravitation. Why the scientific community is in
denial about the falsification of the dark matter model is a question
that requires both a sociological and philosophical explanation"
