The name Oz is actually Öz, with two dots on top, meaning "essence" a
name with nationalistic overtones (TR lastnames started in 30s).  Oz
got lucky, in US the dots are dropped so the name sounds like Oz as in
"The Wizard of Oz", plus he looks Vulcan he could rock that image of
wizardy, scifi doctor-bro for many years.. US is a place of
reinvention, right?

---

There .. 

The Independent: "[2018] Japan to bolster military base on island
idyll that could become front line in event of war... [in the]
disputed seas around China.. Japan is building radar, anti-aircraft
guns and missile silos to counter what it sees as Chinese
aggression.. If war is to break out, then Ishigaki would be the front
line. This is the island where Japan feels the most under threat from
China"

---

Maybe CH won't go after Taiwan but one of those smaller JP islets in
that chain near Taiwan; Taketomi, Ishigaki... CH needs a deep-sea port
for subs, a smaller islet might do for them.

Hindustan Times: "Japan is preparing for war with China, say all
telltale signs"

nanoparticles for the conversion of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur within

Some called the (more likely) lab leak theory racist. But wasn't
saying "Chinese ppl eat anything, bats, snails, their hats, that's why
they had covid" comment also racist?

H2 Fuel News: "A busy week in the world of decarbonisation, with a key
event taking place in the House of Lords on Tuesday 1st November,
organised by the HyDeploy consortia.. HyDeploy2 delivered 20% blended
hydrogen with natural gas in a second trial for around 1,600 residents
in the village of Winlaton, near Gateshead"

---

Climate activists need to get into the weeds of climate tech and
policy.  Can't just call fossil companies bad names. Fossil companies
have a lot of know-how they can be helpful in the transition - given
we use the right tech.

---

It's not about whether to "bring back nuclear" - but *what kind*. The
defining feature of the new tech is not they are "small and modular"
either, MSM is off. The key word is helium-cooled - coupled with their
TRISO cartridges, making them safe. Spent fuel utilization is another
new way. 

---

CHCFA: "The Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (CHFCA) and
its members applaud the 2022 Fall Economic Statement presented by the
Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s Minister of Finance last week.

The statement, which highlights clean hydrogen as an essential part of
Canada’s net-zero future, outlines the government’s commitment to
accelerate hydrogen energy adoption through the new Canada Growth Fund
and investment tax credits for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles
(FCEVs) and refueling infrastructure"

CENTO, now-defunct organization, was formed to contain, you guessed
it, Russia from its South, consisting of Iran, Iraq, Pakistan,
TR. Look at Britain, way the f--k over there in the West.

---

Everyone knows the radio speech of an '60 coup leader, "we are
respectful of NATO and CENTO". That guy later became the founder of an
ultra-nationalist party.

---

Tigger nationalists are useful idiots for the Anglo... Nat ideology
makes ppl feel foreign to their land ("just" arrived, nomadic
migrants) fear their neighbors, so they will be more in need of
overseas friends.

---

This takes me to the aughts, when an EU official's (Fogg) emails were
leaked to the press by this guy, EU-Anatolia relations were
damaged. Many thought the intel was given to him by RU FSB. MI6 makes
more sense - they would have more to gain - ala inner vs outer fight.

---

Name is Perincek. Turkist dickwad

Saw a vid, a retired TR spy chief just blurted out a politician,
"journalist" was actually in the employ of the Brits. Everyone thought
the fucker was Russian / Chinese asset.

Whatever her effect was earlier, on PA race, she'd made a difference
because she knew Oz personally, helped him become the big celebrity he

I realize SA has organization skill, she was helpful for 2020
get-out-the-vote efforts. But running for office herself apparently is
not her thing.

---

Beto and Stacy Abrahams got the crap beaten out of them. These are
perennial losers, I hope they stop trying to run for office, they are
taking up space, attention someone else can use, someone who can win
and gain governing experience.

Leary, *Pharmageddon*: "On the surface medical practice appears the
same but underneath it’s not. For instance, a small number of people
have a genetic disorder that leads to excessively high cholesterol
levels and for them drugs like the statins can save lives.. For the
most part, however, the statins are instead given to healthy people
who have mild elevations of their cholesterol levels. Similarly,
treatments for asthma or osteoporosis are now given to many people who
would never have been diagnosed and treated before.  Treatment happens
now in response to results on a series of tests that have emerged in
recent years—but these new tests don’t help make a diagnosis that will
lift a threat to our lives. Instead they effectively make a diagnosis
of some drug deficiency disorder, and they often enter medical
practice as part of the marketing strategy for a new drug.

These new diseases and their treatments have gained a purchase on us
because they are presumed to represent the latest advances in a story
of progress that runs through insulin and the antibiotics and will
hopefully lead someday to cures for cancer. These are the drugs that,
had they been available, some presume might have saved many of my
father’s generation. But far from saving either their lives or ours,
clinical trials show that the indiscriminate use of drugs to lower
lipids or blood sugars, to relieve respiratory wheeze, or to block
stress hormones may even increase the risk of loss of life, and appear
to be doing so in the United States, the country that makes the
greatest use of the latest pharmaceuticals, where since the mid-1970s
life expectancy has been falling progressively further behind other
developed countries"

More science fail 

Kroupa: "Dark Matter Doesn't Exist.. The current cosmological model
only works by postulating the existence of dark matter – a substance
that has never been detected, but that is supposed to constitute
approximately 25% of all the universe. But a simple test suggests that
dark matter does not in fact exist. If it did, we would expect lighter
galaxies orbiting heavier ones to be slowed down by dark matter
particles, but we detect no such slow-down. A host of other
observational tests support the conclusion: dark matter is not
there. The implications of this are nothing short of a revision of
Einstein’s theory of gravitation. Why the scientific community is in
denial about the falsification of the dark matter model is a question
that requires both a sociological and philosophical explanation"
