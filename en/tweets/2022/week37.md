Note the policy-fu.. Could we "poll bunch of people" on the street and
create equally significant policy? I don't think so.

Hydrogen Europe: "Following the plenary vote on the Renewable Energy
Directive II (REDII), Hydrogen Europe wholeheartedly welcomes the
historical European Parliament (EP) decision to commit to ambitious
binding renewable targets and to simplify the regulatory framework...

Further good news from the parliament today is the return of the
additionality principle to legal regulation, rather than delegating
this to the European Commission via the Delegated Act of RED II. This
will ease the implementation of the additionality principle for
renewable hydrogen. MEPs have listened to the sector‚Äôs concerns that
overly strict regulations would hinder the development of this crucial
market. Hydrogen Europe fully recognises the importance, and supports,
the principle of additionality but has expressed concerns regarding
the practical implementation of the proposed criteria, not the
principle itself. The task at hand is to find a balance between
ensuring green hydrogen is produced from new renewable energy capacity
and avoiding excessive constraints on a nascent market"

*Deus*, wonderful, wonderful scifi movie, starring Claudia Black from
*Farscape*.

A lot of the black cultural artifacts have Southern flavor (ie
American), repackaged. The showy parts were created so mainstream
could play Dances with Wolves with it. It is hilarious I refer to them
but may not be beneficial for its supposed owners.

---

A black kid born into the culture, same way.. Everyone gets culture,
by merely being in it.

---

That means first, second generation "Irish" doesn't become 100% of
what their ancestors were, they [assimilate](2014/06/the-culture-code.html#imprint),
into a culture that is only 10% of that. They will never be 100% Irish. 

---

Immigrants contribute to culture prop to their size... 10% of United
States is of Irish desc, that makes them 10% Irish in culture.

RU already has all of Luhansk, a portion of Donetsk (the pink lines on
the map). They are still advancing in Donetsk, there is shelling all
across the east and southern front.

There is also activity in southwest, towards Odessa. From the attack
patterns it looks like RU still intends to landlock Ukraine.

"'A few weeks like this and the European economy will just go into a
full stop,' [Belgian PM] told Bloomberg on Thursday. 'Recovering from
that is going to be much more complicated than intervening in gas
markets today. The risk of that is de-industrialization and severe
risk of fundamental social unrest.'"

The assasination of Diana was probably race-related. Then Meghan
Markle events were racism related.. For a country who "abolished
slavery early" they sure have a lot of that over there, especially at
the top.

---

There was the talk of a "Kherson annexation referandum" a while
back. If it is pursued, and people there vote Ja on the Anschluss,
then they automatically become Russian citizens, and massive
mobilization to defend them could be in the offing.

---

I dont think Russia will leave what it considers crucial areas - the
land bridge to Crimea, areas in Donbas.

The biggest downside of the royalty is they cement certain type of
Britain. After Brexit they asked Liz II 'what will happen to us now'?
She was like "well I'm still here". Royals have certain legitimacy
(perhaps Europe's institution were also a danger to that legitimacy)
so their very presence might lulled people thinking all is fine. Get
rid of Europe, who cares, we have an old lady who feeds ducks in an
elaborate ceremony once in a while.

"BayoTech, Inc. an innovator in hydrogen solutions, announced the
Detroit region as the next location for the expansion of its

to a BayoGaaS‚Ñ¢ Hydrogen Hub, producing 350 tonnes per year of
low-carbon hydrogen.. 'The infrastructure going into ACM will not only
support users of our facility but the needs for low-carbon hydrogen in

RU has unbelivable advantages in the larger region around UKR;
scanning the map at first you see this thin slice of a land seperate
from Moldova, and wonder WTH is that? It is Transnistria, unrecognised

to connect to that region.

said, in what is the deadliest such incident involving electric
vehicles in the country...

A spate of electric scooter fires this year has alarmed the
government.. Early investigations have identified faulty battery cells
and battery modules among the main causes.. In March, India launched
an investigation over safety concerns after a string of e-scooter
fires, including one in which a man and his daughter died when their
e-bike 'went up in flames'".

George Ellis: "Theoretical physics and cosmology find themselves in a
strange place. Scientific theories have since the seventeenth century
been held tight by an experimental leash. In the last twenty years or
so, both string theory and theories of the multiverse have slipped the
leash. Their owners argue that this is no time to bring these subjects
to heel.

It is this that is strange.

Misery Loves Company

The multiverse is a collection, set, or ensemble of possibly disjoint
universes. They are possible because no one knows whether they
exist. Max Tegmark has contemplated four different kinds of
multiverse, and Brian Greene, nine. Nothing exceeds like excess"

Can latest UKR gains be used as basis for piece summit? Defenders can
boast they are now negotiating from a "position of strength", RU has
part of Donetsk, Luhansk, Crimea and a land bridge from Russia to
Crimea.. Maybe time to call this thing quits and turn on the gas
tap. Or will the war continue throughout the winter?

The Guardian: "Richard Stengel [Dem, formerly State Dept] criticized
media coverage of the Queen‚Äôs death, saying on MSNBC that though Queen
Elizabeth‚Äôs 'unrivaled service' should be lauded, she still presided
over more than 30 countries as head of state and her family‚Äôs legacy
of colonialism 'had a terrible effect on much of the world'"

---

The Guardian: "Harvard University history professor Maya Jasanoff
wrote in the New York Times that the Queen‚Äôs stoic presence in life as
a 'fixture of stability' underlied a 'stolid traditionalist front over
decades of violent upheaval'"

---

"@MukomaWaNgugi

If the queen had apologized for slavery, colonialism and
neocolonialism and urged the crown to offer reparations for the
millions of lives taken in her/their names, then perhaps I would do
the human thing and feel bad. As a Kenyan, I feel nothing. This
theater is absurd"

---

One party leader spoke up for Assange, but he is considered the "town
fool" by mainstream anyway, the issue was ignored.

---

Prev talk on Australia becoming a Republic is now AWOL. Did it ever
makes sense strategically? They need a relationship with a naval power
cementing their connection to the outer alliance still being in
CWealth would be helpful there.. If the mainstream could not say a
word edgewise on Assange, why would they bother with a change into a
Republic?

The RU gas dependency increased throughout Schroder and Merkel
era.. Mutti was also keeping the easties in check when they freaked
out on Russia. The strategy went ahead past 2008, 2014 .. Nordstream 2

RU hawks.

Hands-on info is always helpful; before writing on H2 I did a little
water splitting myself. Iron electrodes, wrong path gets you sodium
chloride, [no-no](https://youtu.be/T-OwWOYHhMI?t=266), used graphite,
it worked - produced H2.

CNBC: "The clean hydrogen energy economy was a dream. The climate bill
could make it a reality this decade"

"Researchers Discover a Single Catalyst Capable of Splitting Both
Freshwater and Seawater at Low Voltage..  [They] report using a nickel
/ molybdenum / nitrogen compound, tweaked with a small amount of iron
and grown on nickel foam to efficiently produce hydrogen and then,
through a process of electrochemical reconstruction sparked by cycling
voltage, converted to a compound that produced a similarly powerful
oxygen evolution reaction.

The researchers said using a single compound for both the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) ‚Äì
albeit slightly changed through the reconstruction process ‚Äì not only
makes water splitting more affordable, it also simplifies the
engineering challenges"

KBR: "[Our] large-scale blue hydrogen process uses its proprietary
KRES and well-proven SMR-based technology for expanding single-stream
hydrogen capacity. Bulk of the CO2 generated in the process is
captured as pure CO2, readily available for CO2 capture
applications... Flue gas generation is about 50% lower than
conventional processes.. CO2 recovery >95% of the total CO2 generated
as process CO2 is feasible with minor energy penalty. This can
eliminate requirement of post combustion CO2 capture plant - High
CAPEX and OPEX savings"

H2 Central "[Dutch] OCI announced it will start construction of a
world-scale 1.1 million ton per annum blue ammonia project in
Beaumont, Texas, based on KBR technology. The passage of the US
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the enhanced 45Q credits in the Act
strengthened the attractiveness of this project.

The US Gulf is a strategic location that allows the facility to serve
both the US market and export clean ammonia as a hydrogen carrier to
hydrogen deficit markets around the world such as Europe and Asia, as
well as catering for expected significant demand from new applications
including power and shipping fuels"
