# Week 50 

"@hiveenergy

Hive [Energy's] renewable energy pipeline is over 23 GW! 

We have upcoming projects in 20 countries including Zambia, Spain, New
Zealand, Greece, and Croatia.

Not only are we working on solar projects, but we have wind, green
hydrogen, and green ammonia undertakings"

individual water molecules during electrolysis, the team managed to

For its next-gen fighter plane Japan did not go with US, but went with

I wouldn't be surprised to see Coinbase as a hostile takeover target
by a big bank in 2023... with the debt at 15% yield and the decline
below $10 billion in market cap, it would cost Jamie Dimon ~5% of JPM
stock to buy the market leader outright"

15.6 GW is massive - that's a quarter of a Nordstream pipeline.

H2 LOHC Tech: One VLCC ship can carry up to 350,000 DWT which would be
equivalent to 17,000 tons H2. One train in Europe can pull up to 35
wagons which would be equivalent to 59 tons of H2.

A quick calculation shows the amount of energy that can be carried
across Atlantic by a fleet of 20 ships using LOHC techology,

```python
trip = 17000*1000*33.6 / (365*24*1e3)
print ("One trip, single ship %0.1f MW" % (trip))
print ("Fleet %0.1f GW" % (one_trip*12*20 / 1e3))
```

```text
One trip, single ship 65.2 MW
Fleet 15.6 GW
```

Mastodon did not do anything revolutionary, it merely created a
protocol for different servers to communicate, and simple software to
manage the content. Now bigger companies (esp ones with existing user
base) can have their servers running a social net protocol, users can
communicate through it.

---

E-mail works via disparete servers too; GMail has its own servers,
Yahoo has theirs, they communicate through a protocol called SMTP. I
don't have to be on Yahoo system to email someone at Yahoo. Facebook,
Twitter work on a backward, suboptimal 'monolith' mechanism.. The
problem is, as usual, over-commercialization of a platform.

F24: "The pipeline between Barcelona and Marseille -- also known as
BarMar -- will carry two million tonnes of hydrogen per year, or 10
percent of European consumption, once it goes online, said Spanish
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez.

'It is going to be the first major hydrogen corridor in the European
Union,' Sanchez said.

The project will cost around 2.5 billion euros ($2.6 billion), he said
at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron and
Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa.

The three leaders formally signed off on the plans in the presence of
EU Commission chief Ursula Von der Leyen on the sidelines of a
