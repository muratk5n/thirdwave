# Week 1 

Heliogen went public recently. They received $39 million grant from
DOE, steel maker ArcelorMittal invested. 

On the residential / industrial division: homes would still receive
CSP power through their tech operated by utilities, so people will
benefit, there is no need to install an entire solar farm in their
backyard. CSP's focus is massive scale, availability, and that's good,
much benefit to derive from that, eg at night they use power stored in
molten salt to run 24/7, something PV solar cannot do.

Gov did good here.. They looked at the tech, pondered what is needed
to advance it, and boom! A whole new consortium.

Energy.gov: "Heliostat Consortium..  is funded by the .. DOE.. A
heliostat is a device that continually tilts a mirror or multiple
mirror facets to track the sun’s movement in order to reflect sunlight
toward a predetermined target—such as a receiver sitting on top of a
solar tower. Heliostats are a critical component of CSP"

I checked the data, Granger causality shows the two-year treas affects
FEDFUNDS little more than the other way around. Both sides would
follow eachother closely to gauge reaction to events, but since for
bonds inflation is a major risk, they can't not rise (in yields) in
response to rising inflation. In turn the overnight borrowing rates
between banks cannot be neutral to that (read: FEDFUNDS), they'd lose
money on a daily basis. So FED wld be forced to follow the bond
market.

"Although it is still debatable whether the Fed leads or follows the
market, movements in the policy rate are associated with similar
movements in short-term interest rates [as in treasury bonds]"

Vox: "'Money feeling strange in 2021 is based on a decade of money
slowly feeling strange for lots and lots of different people
throughout the world,' said .. professor.. So much of the economy
feels like a scam — the gig economy, student loans, the hope of
retirement, a 9-to-5 job. Consumers are always being tricked and
squeezed by corporations. The promise of the middle class is fading
fast, so for a lot of people, it just feels like you might as well
lean into whatever financial chaos is available to try to hit it
big. If housing prices are so high you’re never going to be able to
own a home, why not try your hand at real estate in whatever the
metaverse is?"

We dont use particles to calculate fluids.

This is *key* to understand how modern science is conducted.
[Food for thought](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13fTfDxQdQ6oFKKkKbNcuAbHD-P7un6Q-).

"But if we use particles to simulate a fluid, why not using brain

"It has happened again. Microsoft and Nvidia have built [NN] three
times the size of GPT-3, the former holder of the title. However, in
contrast with GPT-3, this new model hasn’t caused any commotion,
neither in the press nor in the AI community. And there’s a reason for
that...

Do we really need yet another biggest neural network?.. What are the
consequences of following the path of scaling models ad infinitum —
for the AI community in particular, and the world in general? Wouldn’t
it be better if we gave more space to other approaches to AI and
artificial general intelligence (AGI)?..

[NN based Large language model] LLMs have been recently entitled
'foundation models' by dozens of Stanford researchers. They argue that
these ever-larger neural networks comprise “an emerging paradigm for
building artificial intelligence systems.” But not all AI experts
agree with this fancy title.

Jitendra Malik, a professor of computer science at Berkeley says that
'the term ‘foundation’ is horribly wrong.' Adding, 'The language we
have in these models is not grounded, there is this fakeness, there is
no real understanding.' Mark Riedl, a professor at the Georgia Tech
School said on Twitter that “branding very large pre-trained neural
language models as 'foundation' models is a brilliant .. PR stunt.”..

But 'foundation models' isn’t the only title the AI community has
given to LLMs. In a paper dating March 2021 Emily M. Bender, Timnit
Gebru, and others called these models 'stochastic parrots.'"

postpones future confrontations with the paramilitary Rapid Support

Let's not forget [Oct 2021 oil spill](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/10/05/what-caused-california-oil-spill/6001096001/)
near California.

A ship's anchor broke the pipeline, if H2 was being sent, worst case,
H2 mixing into H2O would be no big deal.

The CA crude oil leak lasted for 3 hours before it was detected. More
than 140,000 gallons of oil leaked into Southern California waters.

"Sixteen wells off Louisiana have been leaking since September

According to data in the link, oil pipelines have 4.9 E-4 per year-km
failure rate, natural gas 7.2 E-5. Canada has over 70,000 kilometers of
oil pipelines,

```python
print (int(70000 * 4.9*1e-5), 'accidents per year')
```

```text
3 accidents per year

This is the expected \# of accidents.

The best protection is not to have fossil pipelines.

Pipelines, coal, natgas, high prices, shortages.. This is where rubber
meets the road; switching from old to new was never going to be easy.

Any energy that moves needs to be clean molecules, prefarably H2 gas.
Much cleaner than fossil, more efficient than the electric grid. H2
pipeline can transmit 10 times the energy at 8th the cost.

Canada has over 70,000 km of large transmission oil pipelines. Any of
those cld go haywire and the environment disaster would be severe.

Negative correlation, -0.47, between the stock market and the FED rate.

The asset purchases do not show up in the base numbers, but they can
be considered as a form of negative interest rate policy. If their
effect was included somehow, the negative correlation would be even
more pronounced.

Ergo once the asset purchases stop, that act will be akin to a rate
rise.

---

The stock market is a socialist stock market right now. Government
(the FED) is propping it up with its asset purchases and low
rates. When that stops and rate rises begin let's see that nice "free
market" holds up..

We saw a hint of that in 2018, with a mere 2.40% FEDFUNDS the
"correction" that followed scared the shit out of FOMO monkeys.
"Thanks" to the pandemic FEDFUNDS went near zero now and voila, enter
the boom of all booms.

#thematrix

One way to look at the Matrix movies is as small, muted, centrist
shitlib protests..  The system is not changed bcz these people are
fine with it as it is, they merely want to be "recognized" in it, to
be its The One (which everyone can beee if you belieeeeve), so they
can fly over it, be "loud and proud" while they enjoy a simplistic
diversity around them, and "represent". Strangely similar ending to
*Jupiter Ascending* (same director), the cleaner girl discovers she is
space royalty, then "saves Earth" with her "diverse" new boyfriend /
soldier, but returns, stays as a cleaner, while once in a while flies
over the city to enjoy her specialness and uniqueness. People are not
being harvested but have no idea what happened, things stay the same

#thematrix

---

The meta stuff was probably due to the original's imagery being an
overbearing presence.. Director must have felt the only way to get out
from under that is to reference it as another version, go a little
meta

#thematrix

---

*The Matrix Resurrections*; good to see the lead actors again, movie
had some good ideas.. but if there are no "reboot sequels", the
situation is no different than at the end of the first movie. Then
it's like what's the point? After the first, most expected the
destruction of the "system". The absence of that ending sapped the
energy of the sequels, wout courage they ended up as neutered, cheap
war movies with a few memorable action scenes
