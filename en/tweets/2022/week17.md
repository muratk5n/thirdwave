H2 Fuel News: "Canadian-based Hydrofuel has completed an exclusive
licence agreement with Georgia Institute of Technology for the patent
pending MAPS system that could unlock green hydrogen and ammonia that
is cheaper than fossil fuels.

According to the company, the MAPS system enables high-yield,
sustainable ammonia synthesis from air and water with high efficiency
using a gas-phase electrochemical process"

In ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª and ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡® gas network operators present the Nordic Hydrogen Route project:

- 1,000 km of new hydrogen pipelines
- commissioning around 2030
- a local demand of 65 TWh of H2 (2 Mt) at 2050
- a reduction of 20 Mt of CO2"

Reuters: "Egypt to work with UAE's Masdar to make green
hydrogen.. Egypt said on Sunday it would cooperate with the United
Arab Emirate's Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) on the
production of green hydrogen. Masdar and Hassan Allam (HA) Utilities,
a subsidiary of Hassan Allam Holding, will form a strategic alliance
to develop green hydrogen production plants in the Suez Canal Economic
Zone and on the Mediterranean coast, to produce up to 480,000 tons of
green hydrogen annually, the Egyptian cabinet said in a statement.

"@hertzsprrrung

What reader would ever complain about overly detailed derivations? Not
me, for sure; I've Iost countless hours figuring out those missing
steps!"

---

"@HiroNishikawa

Now a reviewer says there are too many details in the
derivations. Sometimes, too much information is better than lack of
information; it helps avoid confusions and ambiguities. But for this I
can cut a lot of intermediate steps; and I can leave them all in a
preprint"

True liberterians could actually affect some change here; they would
be for the abolition of F-F. If democracy worked they'd do their
thing, the left would do the outside-the-market help thing, overall
things would approach to some kind of working setup. Instead there is
a weird mush of market/non-market solutions, and the 'heated debates'
are on stupid culture war.

---

On the previously shared Eslake comment "Schemes that allow people to
pay more for housing than they otherwise would, will result in more
expensive housing". Then how can we help people to have housing?

Increasingly it looks like butting into market mechanism can
backfire. So best help in any area should aim to take entire swaths of
said area out of the market-based system. For health insurance,
single-payer is much better right (which takes nearly the totality of
health insurance out of private scheme) than trying to co-exist with
the market which fails to insure everyone (Obamacare).

For housing, gov can pay, employ, manage projects seperately, outside
the market structure to build, deliver housing. Slightly nudging one
rate here, fiddling with the market there can create unwanted
side-effects. In US we saw it happen; those orgs Eddie, Freddie,
Fannie, whatever, they've been there for decades, yet in US median
house price now reached nearly half a million dollars. Fannie, Freddie
being the bizarre in/out market creations they are, fueled the Great
Financial Crisis too and nearly caused the collapse of the system.

Madagascar in food trouble.. A lot of regions there with food security

Some use the term as in journalism done with raw data; That's nice
too, but I mean publishing of raw data as journalism.

---

Data journalism would be fly; imagine there is http://data.nytimes.com,
or data.washingtonpost.com, and every major event, like war, gets its
relative URL, for Ukraine-Russia war situation the regions assesed,
claimed could be published in daily JSON files on /conflict/ukr/20220424/map.json;
people interested can fetch, process, plot.

But it is very likely MI6 had her killed. That part is a tragedy.

---

That's a stretch. I remember after her death they were throwing out
those words, 'she was like Mother Teresa'.. fem acquiantences at the
time took a major issue with that.. Mother Teresa lived with the poor,
spent her life among them. What did Diana do? Make a diva entrance to
some event, and disappear afterwards? C'mon.

Most Kurds live without an official country. They certainly cannot
join NATO, have no diplomatic basis to even consider it. The Kurds who
were a threat to TR became that way because of latter's failed
policies, its faulty nation creation project.

"Isn't the situation of Kurds same as Ukraine's?

CH-SI deal was signed but the language is reportedly vague on the

No *entente cordiale* saz the article..

Politico: "Donâ€™t expect Macronâ€™s win to reset UK-France ties.. Yet
British officials â€” who have previously blamed the French electoral
campaign for rows with Macronâ€™s government on everything from
post-Brexit fishing rights to a nuclear submarine deal with Australia
and the treatment of undocumented Channel migrants â€” donâ€™t expect a
huge diplomatic reset to follow the result.

Instead, theyâ€™re eyeing more modest wins, and hoping for more dialogue
between the two leaders in the coming months. And, despite Johnsonâ€™s
hopeful remarks, the mood music coming out of the French government
Monday wasnâ€™t drastically different either"

Oil and Gas: "The remarkable fall in the cost of renewable power has
surely enabled commercial green hydrogen ventures such as NEOM... A
pipeline connecting the eastern Mediterranean with Europe [is being
considered]. While natural gas pipelines in the western Mediterranean
currently link Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco to Spain, Portugal and
Italy, there is no pipeline in the east. But a hydrogen-capable
pipeline there could be a breakthrough for NEOM and others.. [W]ithin
a 300-kilometre radius of Sharm el-Sheikh (where the COP 27 conference
will occur this fall) are places with potential 100+ GW production
potential in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan"

"At Raven [SR Inc], we are revolutionizing the way the world uses
waste. We take any organic waste and convert it to clean hydrogen and
synthetic Fischer-Tropsch fuels through our patented Steam/CO2
Reforming process. We use steam and a chemical process, not
combustion, to process mixed feedstock (biogenics, plastics and/or
methane) into saleable products in an environmentally friendly,
efficient and profitable way. Our story begins in 1885 with Daniel
Best â€“ great-grandfather of Dr. Terry Galloway (technology creator)
and great-great grandfather of Matt Murdock (Raven founder)"

Current news: there are TR attacks toward all PKK areas, in Syria and
Iraq, even the Iraqi gov joined in for attack on Sinjar. Trouble
around Idlib too.. Somebody is eager for a 'Tamil Tiger moment'.

Asia Minor incursion required KDP (Barzani family) help, and they are
helping, with cries of backstabbing, "Kurd against Kurd violence"
blame thrown at them.

---

From TR standpoint, the more PKK was attacked the more it spread.
So war-war policy has been a fail so far.

Post Arab Spring PKK spread to Sinjar, near Syria (red cross in map),
helping anti-ISIS fight there, after the fight they stayed. Then they
linked with Syrian NE. Then the sister org there declared autonomy, 2017.

Various paths from that Qandil mountain to TR; one from Iraq but they
cld easily enter through Iran, immediately cross the Iranian border,
go north and enter from there.. I'm sure they received a lot of help
from Iran over the years.

The darker green areas are Kurdish regions of Iraq, recognized by
central gov, with three governates, associated with two seperate
Kurdish Regional Gov families (north vs south), KDP and PUK. PKK
nestled itself at the intersection of three of these actors, KDP, PUK,
Iran, and on top of the hightest mountain of Iraq (the red dot).
KDP/PUK fought before, while in alliance now, doesn't hurt to
stay right between them for max leverage.
