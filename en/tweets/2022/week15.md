KEYOU unveils its first hydrogen-powered vehicles.. wo prototypes were
shown to demonstrate the technologyâ€™s versatility: an 18-ton truck and
a 12-meter city bus. Both types produce up to 210 kilowatts of
electricity by converting current diesel engines to hydrogen. The
company claims 500 kilometers of autonomy with a full tank"

H2 Energy News: "Complete conversion to hydrogen is possible in the
medium term.. Roland Harings, CEO of Aurubis, Europeâ€™s largest copper
producer, has devised a contingency plan in the event of a gas
shortage"

H2 View: "[With a new] process.. methane pyrolysis is used to produce
hydrogen. The input is methane (or natural gas)... Rather than CO2,
the process creates carbon black as a by-product. Unlike CO2, carbon
black is a solid product and hence easy to capture and use or
sequester. Carbon black in turn is used to produce the rubber for
tires amongst other applications, giving it resale value rather than
being a pure waste product"

H2 Fuel News: "Nevada Air Liquide hydrogen plant to produce fuel from
garbage gas"

H2 View: "Lhyfe and wpd have partnered to develop a large-scale green
hydrogen production facility which will harness 600MW of wind energy
to produce the clean energy carrier in Sweden"

---

H2 View: "Elogen and Sarralle have signed a green hydrogen generation
agreement that will see the clean energy carrier integrated into the
steel manufacturing sector"

PAK army is too involved in civilian politics. They "talk too much". I
remember it like yesterday Asia Minor right-wing fascist coup leader
Evren and theirs Zia ul-Haq shaking hands smiling to the cameras and
calling eachother brothers. Overly meddling mil types need to get a
soda and a smile and shut the phuck up. Go to your barracks muckers

---

The parliament choice on its own is democratic can't deny that. If IK
uses the event to mobilize supporters and come back stronger, great.

"Shehbaz Sharif elected as Pakistanâ€™s new prime minister.. Election by
parliament comes after.. Imran Khan.. lost a vote of no confidence"

"Stranger things have happened". Nope.. I don't think so..

That guy almost became Labor Secretary BTW

"@MorePerfectUS

.. In Long Beach, CA, on Friday workers challenged Starbucks' illegal
union busting campaign. 'If you hate Starbucks so much, why donâ€™t you
go somewhere else?'  Schultz shot back"

Covid and high home prices likely the cause. Rates have been too low for too long..

"[T]here are 11.2 million RV-owning households in the U.S., an
increase of 62% over the past 20 years"

"Canada bans foreign homebuyers for two years in effort to cool
market.. Government under pressure after prices climbed by more than
20% last year, while rental rates have also been rising"

---

Around 2006/7 the speculation on real-estate was so excessive, I once
heard a real-estate reference on a military show, *The Unit*
(2006-2009). A housewife was talking about "flipping" houses, and was
actively involved in the market.. This was a show about the life of
government employees BTW.

Inner/outer bickering is not a mere extension of a "post-WWII order".
China was on the winning side then (notice the seat at the UNSC), but
they are now the competition. After the fall of the Berlin Wall Russia
transitioned into free markets, democracy, yet they still had NATO
crawling up their ass. No the reason for the animosity is beyond the
so-called spread of freedom. Russia could be a bastion of democracy
tomorrow, they would still not be accepted as an ally.

The Times: "Finland and Sweden set to join Nato as soon as summer"

There was a lot of clapping for [that guy](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CsRJd0stQfuMOOfXK0LNiuIQEctNVhuC)
too, remember him? What happened to his country?

These people just love clapping.. Festive muthafuckas

H2 Fuel News: "A recent report in PV Magazine pointed to a green
hydrogen economy as Africaâ€™s best opportunity for unity and unity for
Africaâ€™s best opportunity to become powerful in renewable energy.  The
report showed that the potential from renewable power is great enough
that it could possibly help countries throughout the continent to
overcome the obstacles to using the sustainable resources that are
abundantly available there"

Asking ppl for up and down vote on representatives, fine. Asking on
policy, not fine.

"In an unusual step, Mexico president asks voters if he should go"

---

Excessive love for immigration, wanting open-borders is likely a
deluded by-product of rabid liberalism with its focus on
individuality.. To them the immigrant is 'expressing his/her
individuality' by choosing to emigrate to a liberal country like the
US. They want to fight for the immigrant just like they fight for
people's inalienable rights abroad and topple governments in their
name (which actually benefit oil and arms manufacturers but hey it's
the thought that counts). However such free love creates a point of
contention with traditionally left-leaning labor as more people
increase competition for wages. Cesar Chavez, a Hispanic union leader
[did not support](../../2021/03/ship-of-fools.md#chavez) open borders.

How are unionizing efforts at Walmart? The Atlantic had an [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/how-walmart-convinces-its-employees-not-to-unionize/395051/)
on that in 2015.

BTW, Amazon is not the biggest in retail. Walmart is. 2018 retail sales,

Walmart	$387.66

Amazon.com  $120.93

The Kroger Co. $119.70

Great job. Leadership - it matters.

Someone needs to look into that Roth IRA trick Focker pulled off to evade taxes.

People in this Paypal mafia are bizarre self-serving weirdos.

---

Focker always looked like a jagoff apparently.

The other is the e-battery e-jagoff before cosmetic make-over.

Another advantage of ranked-choice system over the two-round approach;
TRS cuts off the next round candidates at two. With RCS the third
candidate close to the second (and the first) might have shot up with
the help of people's 2nd, 3rd level choices. It's unlikely but possible.

If there was media that went beyond fan-fiction we'd have received
this info, but sadly objective coverage is AWOL

They might be lulling you into a false sense of security, don't fall
for it. In the meantime UKR is underreporting its own military losses.

Covid could be an attack; Look at China, they act like they are under
siege, have a lockdown in the entire city of Shangai? Why are they not
quitting zero-covid? No mRNA vax for them? Maybe they don't trust it,
suspect bio targeting. It looks like a war.

New attacks in the ME are likely proxy attacks on US/NATO. As things
get worse between inners/outers, latest in Ukraine, places could be
targeted. The more the war lingers on, the more everyone will lose.
