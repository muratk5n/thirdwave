What to do with the CO2?

"Turning CO2 to stone.. Basalt, which is created as lava cools,
contains calcium, iron, and magnesium, which react naturally with CO2
to form solid carbonate minerals. Within two years, 95 percent of the
injected CO2 had turned to mineral.. Basalt, which made Iceland the
ideal location, is also abundant beneath the oceans, including just
off shore from coastal power plants"

H2 production is possible with chemical looping

"[2012] As one of the potential [CCS] solutions, chemical looping
technologies are projected to be economically advantageous in a
carbon-constrained scenario... [The tech] utilizes a metal oxide
material as an oxygen carrier medium to indirectly oxidize the fuel
and generate high-quality heat and/or H2. Cyclic reduction–oxidation
reactions are performed in discrete reactor vessels allowing for
inherent air–fuel separation, which provides intrinsic CO2 separation
thus mitigating the cost for CO2 capture...

Chemical looping processes can be described by two key applications:
chemical looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping gasification
(CLG). CLC processes use carbonaceous fuel sources, such as coal,
biomass, and natural gas, to reduce the oxygen carrier and are
followed by their direct oxidation with air to produce high-quality
heat, which can then be used for electricity
generation. Alternatively, the CLG system utilizes a third
intermediate step between the air and fuel reactor to produce a clean
energy carrier. Here, steam and/or CO2 is used to partially oxidize
the reduced oxygen carrier to produce H2"

demonstration unit for Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) [which] is an
oxy-combustion technology used to convert biomass and fossil fuels in
order to obtain a flow of pure CO2 suitable for low-cost capture"

The IFP link shows 2018 finds on a map, it looks pretty busy there
with seemingly big numbers but overall, the total is low. Ain't gonna
find another Ghawar 'nam sayin'? 

---

Units boe are barrels of oil, mb, or mboe is million barrels, for gas
they use boe too - in terms of energy they calculated the equivalent
amount from gas volume into barrels, so oil and gas can be measured in
same units. Gboe is billions of barrels.

New oil and gas discoveries per year (billion barrels of oil equivalent).
Discoveries have been falling in a big way since 2008.

Has 50 mil barrels worth, if they extracted it in a year that would be
abt 140K barrels a day, 9 Gigawatts of energy. However in a year it
wld all be GONE. Tapped out.

"New oil discovery in Gulf of Suez is one of area’s largest in 20
years.. As reported by Reuters, Egypt’s Petroleum Minister, Tarek El
Molla, said that there are about 45 to 50 million barrels that can be
extracted, which could be done in less than a year"

Most new fossil action is offshore. ExxonMobil upped its estimate for
the "Stabroek Block" find offshore Guyana, which is approx 10 billion
barrels. Largest in the world, Ghawar Saudi Arabia, had 96

Guyana is the neighbor of Venezuela, in northern SA.

"[T]he potential terraforming of Venus has received some
consideration, beginning with Carl Sagan.. Venus also provides some
advantages over Mars for colonization with its near-Earth-like surface
gravity, an atmosphere thick enough to provide robust protection from
cosmic rays..

An alternative to terraforming the surface of Venus would be to
colonize the upper atmosphere.. Taking advantage of the twin facts
that the upper atmosphere of Venus at an altitude of 50-55 km has a
similar temperature and pressure to Earth’s surface, and that nitrogen
and oxygen are lifting gases in Venus’s CO2 atmosphere, it would be
possible to construct 'cloud cities' using aerostats filled with
breathable air that could be inhabited by humans. This method
sidesteps most of the problems of colonizing the surface; it would be
achievable with current technology, and it has reached the level of a
mission concept"

Alex Howe, an astrophysicist at NASA has a new paper out on cloud
cities on Venus. Very cool. Excerpts above.

WION called Middle East as "West Asia". I like it. Middle East is too

LCOH for salt caverns and LRC are very good (same doc)

H2 underground storage using salt cav., LRC, and pipes have capital

Same paper

"One spherical or cylindrical receiver is used to heat HTF to the
levels needed for the [thermochemical water splitting cycle]... The
optical efficiency of the ASC is high and reaches 91% in practice,
while it is 100% theoretically like the parabolic dish. Since the wind
flows through its conical rings, the wind load of the ASC is about 10%
that of the parabolic dish of the same dimensions"

---

Beam-down is interesting bcz can reach high temperatures easily, and
at that temperature, water can be split just by sheer heat energy, no
need for electricity.

---

"[2021] Recently, Al-Maaitah.. has developed a high flux solar
concentrator with a lower focal point fixed to the ground composed of
nested conical reflective rings resulting in high solar concentrations
and temperatures well above 1,000 C. Since the focal point is fixed on
the ground, then the high-temperature and high-pressure [high
temparature fluid] can easily be conveyed through solid inexpensive
pipes to the storage tank sitting at the ground underneath the
receiver or next to it. A 10 m in diameter concentrator was built and
tested in Masdar Institute Solar Platform in Abu Dhabi (UAE) where
temperatures exceeding 1,000 C have been reached at the fixed focal
point even at low DNI"

Focusing solar through lenses seem to be somewhat unexplored.

---

For CSP, thermal storage is unnecessary in a H2, NH3 generation
scenario, bcz renewable fuel itself is a form of backup.

---

That's like saying filling up, and emptying the gas tank degrades the
tank, and after a while you can't use half of it.

That ain't  technology - it's a joke.

OMG, cold survival camping! Watched a vid on someone's 'survival'

survive -29C.

1 barrel of oil has 1700 kWh of energy, 7000 x 1700 / (24 x 1e3) is
500 MW. Half a nuclear plant, and something solar can match, easily.
If H2 is generated on-site from that crude and clean fuel is shipped
as export, fine.

Oil Review Africa: "Eni, Sonatrach announce oil and gas discovery in
Berkine North Basin in the Algerian desert. Early estimates place the
size of the find at around 140 million barrels of oil... During the
production test, the well delivered 7000 barrels of oil per day"

My native country is an outer's outpost (in NATO). Been fine with this
alliance personally i.e. it is in homie interest to have a defense
against Russia. We fought these people for centuries; once RU army was
15 km near Stanpoli nearly took the city. It was through major diplom,
'alligianery' that all was saved. Keeping 'future naval powers' at bay
cld be in US citizens' interest too...

But, the system is fraying on the edges.. The alliance arrives with
crass ideology creating unrest leading to ultra-nationalist
movements. The pack leader US doesn't seem to be willing to fight all
the time, so in order to keep the inners contained, chaos is created,
'allowed' on the edges e.g. Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine... The
spillover effect is toxic for all, especially the outposts, one could
argue, even for the seat of the empire itself.

Back during WWI artillery at least had some adventure, 'battlefield
bravery' associated with it, one tactic had infantry advance under
artillery protection / shelling ahead of troops, so when soldiers
reached their target the place would be enemy-free. Troops had to move
very carefully tho, otherwise u get hit too..? The danger!.. I believe
Canada used this technique succesfully a few times (yes, Canada!).

Nowadays after the advent of radio communication, it's all different.
Infantry will explore, pick a target, report back to artillery group,
who will bomb the place from 20 kilometers away. The poor sod getting
blown up won't know what hit him, being shelled by someone who has no
idea who he is, identified by infantry who is completely seperate from
the bombing itself. Tis the modern war.
