Chemical, as in the chemistry used by those disposable hand
warmers. DHWs contain iron powder, salt powder, enclosed in a plastic
wrap. When the contents are removed all comes into contact with air /
oxygen, iron oxide is formed which is an heat-emitting "exothermic"
reaction. User gets heat in the process, the perfect hand warmer. No
electricity, no flame, just basic chemistry.

---

If more ppl came up with chemically activated H2 or ammonia based
heater solutions, it would be helpful, potentially game-changer
even. Something like [this](https://www.design-industry.com.au/lavo-hydrogen-bbq)

CO2 from fossil stays in the atmo for very long time.. When an uptick
in the graph falls, doesnt mean CO2 produced at the high disappears.

Let's zoom in,

```python

Right there.. Peak on July, peak on January, peak on July, peak on
January..  On and on it goes..

Winter spikes are worse. This is US, in the other parts of the world,
fossil burning wld be more extreme. Wood, coal, cow dung..

1KW of heat is required for every 14 cubic meters. 50 m2 for 4 people,
buildings of 4 meters high,

```python
per_person = 10000 # watts
watt_heat_per_m3 = 1/14*1000.
home_vol = 50*4 
heat_w = home_vol*watt_heat_per_m3 / 4
print ('%0.1f watts per person for heating' % heat_w)
print ('%0.1f perc for heating' % (heat_w / per_person * 100.0))
```

```text
3571.4 watts per person for heating
35.7 percent for heating
```

That is the percentage of energy needed for heating assuming a person
needs 10 kilowatts of energy.

Sarkozy started that whole biz. He used to say he wld clean out
'trouble' neighborhoods "a la Kärcher". Added bonus, Kärcher (with

my first foray into school reopening advocacy..

Members of the parent group I helped lead were consistently attacked

Why is Bitcoin price falling when there is inflation? Aren't they
supposed to be a "safe heaven asset", a hedge against "money being
debased"?  Looks like BTC is merely another risky asset just like
those overvalued tech stocks, or, hell, the stock market itself. And
as risky assets go down so does Bitcoin right along with them.

Li battery tech is shockingly bad for the needs of a green
future. Lithium reserves are limited, can only handle 5% of world
storage needs. Fast charging on par with chemically refueling is a
pipe dream, the best they can do is half an hour, which, when applied
degrades the battery increasing the chance of a blowup (when these
f-ing things burn BTW, fire fighters cannot put out the fire with
regular methods). Batteries degrade even with regular charging (see
below) after 3500 cycles they go down to 70% capacity (imagine the
effects of that on a second-hand market for BEVs). Batteries are
heavy, impractical for transportation of energy.  Batteries rely on
rare-earth materials, for which we need to destroy Chile, Bolivia to
get. From a systemic, TCO viewpoint the tech is a complete junk.

---

GKN H2: "Our state-of-the-art metal hydride storage has been developed
and refined over the last 8+ years.. The standard metals we are using
are 100% recyclable.. The low-temperature metal hydride storage system
operates at the same pressure level as electrolysis and fuel cells..
The metal hydrides can last for decades without any losses. (99%
capacity after 3,500 cycles vs. 70% after 2000 cycles with Li
batteries)"

"Duterte wants unvaccinated jailed as COVID rate hits record high"

Sweet. Major planning there with the food.. 

CNBC: "[An] American couple saw the pandemic as an opportunity to
embark on a 3,149-mile hike along the Continental Divide Trail, which
stretches across the United States between the borders of Mexico and
Canada... To ensure they had an adequate supply of food, Miller and
Beissinger dehydrated 100 homemade dinners and mailed them out to the
various towns they planned to pass on their hike"

---

Employees already forgo some of their freedoms when they join a
company.. A company can require its employees to be present at certain
locations for example as its execs see fit, but then, during a
pandemic if everyone at those locations are not vaccinated, the
company could be creating a health risk for them -- a risk which they
might not be willing to take. So it should be within their rights to
require all employees to be vaccinated.

They could create some bizarre convoluted scheme of course, one for
employees with vax, one without vax, but that's just too much of a
pain in the ass. Easier to say "just get the f-ing vax".

It should be within their rights to do so

If you do single-payer, have to do it at scale, the bigger the better,
so California scale would be a good place to start. If they pull it off,
hopefully it will spread to the rest of the country. 

LA Times: "California would enact a sweeping, first-in-the-nation
universal healthcare plan under a proposal unveiled Thursday by a
group of state Democratic lawmakers, providing health services to
every resident and financed by a broad array of new taxes on
individuals and businesses... The proposal, now laid out in separate
pieces of legislation, faces significant hurdles in the coming
months.. “There are countless studies that tell us a single-payer
healthcare system is the fiscally sound thing to do, the smarter
healthcare policy to follow, and a moral imperative if we care about
human life,” Assemblyman Ash Kalra (D-San Jose), the proposal’s
author, said Thursday"

Yann is so full of shit. With his approach, deep neural networks what
came to be called "AI" today, that is *exactly* what they are
doing. If not in the tiniest detail, certainly in spirit, in the
overall approach to the problem. Implicitly they believe what's known
about the human brain so far is final, X number of neurons are there,
they somehow "connect" and do stuff together, so if we start from tiny
particles (software neurons) and build up in code, we will reach human
level intelligence. This is the belief -- yet no cigar. A decade ago
they could be forgiven bcz the hardware "wasn't there yet". Now it
is. Where is Artif. General Intelligence?

NN Expert Yann LeCun: "The cargo cult approach to aeronautics—for
actually building airplanes—would be to copy birds very, very closely;
feathers, flapping wings, and all the rest. And people did this back
in the 19th century, but with very limited success... The equivalent
in AI is to try to copy every detail that we know of about how neurons
and synapses work, and then turn on a gigantic simulation of a large
neural network inside a supercomputer, and hope that AI will
emerge. That’s cargo cult AI"

JFK is claimed by the "Irish" as one of their own, but his kinship,
and comparisons to him should be on the grounds of "young and bad
Presidents" rather than an "Irish" President. And as a young and a bad

Yes some reports talk about a second wave of protests which were
likely "managed" by the sitting Prez trying to use the unrest against
another faction in the country (the previous President).

After Rome invaded Gaul, today's France, did the natives change? Did

"In the early 2010s, Elizabeth Holmes pretended that she had invented
a new technology to do blood tests, and used this pretend technology
to raise several hundred million dollars from gullible
investors.. Back in the 2010s this was all viewed as pretty noteworthy
stuff..

Now of course it is 2022 and we are all a bit more jaded. There was
the SoftBank boom, we've had a couple of years of SPACs, there is so
much crypto. Raising hundreds of millions of dollars from gullible
investors who don't do much due diligence is not particularly
impressive anymore. If you want to do it by pretending to have a
technology, you can (try electric vehicles!), but these days even that
is optional. 'In the past year, there has been a notable rush of
funding into the high-risk category of early-stage startups, as
investors have clamored to get into companies even before they had a
staff or product,' the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Or you
can raise lots of money from investors by letting them pretend to own
digital pictures of apes, or by just saying 'hey here's a Ponzi.?'
Theranos raised a lot of money from investors who did not do too much
due diligence, because the world was awash in money and investors got
careless; that is much, much, much, much more true now, and Theranos
looks a little quaint"

Obviously LPG needs to go (away). Use natgas -> H2 and produce "blue
H2". Use that in cars. If CCS at the source is done well (easy to
regulate) then the car can have no emissions. Use of renewable fuel at
the endpoint assures noone can cheat the way Volkswagen cheated with
diesel.

US EPA: "Nearly all of the fuel carbon (99.5 percent) in LPG is
converted to CO2 during the combustion process. This conversion is
relatively independent of firing configuration"

[PDF](https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/ap42/ch01/final/c01s05.pdf)

---

LPG is part buthane, part propane, both are products of natural gas.
As natgas became more prevalent such use of LPG must have become
feasible back when. I vaguely remember that transition, first noone
had natgas, then some for heating, then it was everywhere. It probably
helped to be the next door neighbor to the natgas export behemoth,
Russia, for TR. Import graph below.

Hah they use LPG in their cars too, same with many cars, esp cabbies
in Asia Minor. They used to put a freaking kitchen gas canister in
there, in the trunk during the 90s and jury-rig the engine to combust
LPG instead of petroleum (cheaper that way). To refuel, take old
canister, put another in. But the tech has developed now, cars can go
to a station and pump the gas in just like one does with petroleum.

"[Kazakhtan protests] began with something very concrete: the price of
liquified petroleum gas, or LPG, the fuel that many use to power their
cars. What caused the spike in LPG prices? It all began with the
phased transition to ..  allow the market to dictate prices instead
[of subsidies]... This policy has, predictably enough, led to a
particularly precipitous rise in costs where demand for this fuel is
high"

Ranked choice voting vs two-round system: With TRS candidates in the
1st round would only be interested in getting more votes than the next
guy. If 10 people are running and 8 ppl get less than 10%, but one
person gets 12%, and the next best gets 11%, they are both in the next
round.

In such a setting candidates can choose appeal to very narrow
constituencies, and still win, then of course in the next round they'd
have to change their tune to appeal to more..  With RCV they'd have to
appeal to the broadest possible electorate from get-go, imo that is a
good thing. Plus rcv is a money saver.

Median is used instead of arithmetic mean precisely to ward off the
effect of extremes. It is used for wealth averages for the same
reason; otherwise people like Bezos would throw everything off. Joe,
Bob are in a room, they have 100,102 dollars, Bezos walks in to the
room, everyone there is now a billionaire, on average. Median sorts
the list and literally picks the person in the middle, in this case
the median wealth is $102. For home prices, that median is almost half
a *f-ing* million dollars.

---

The median home price itself is nearly half a million dollars
BTW.. For four walls and a roof.. There are amenities in it sure,
but nearly *half a million dollars worth*?

---

I remember some "boomer comedy" a while back complaining their kid
still has not left the house, still lives with them. Why not? Well
maybe bcz housing prices are too high. Prev generation outsourced,
killed wage growth, killed rates, and stock and real-estate prices
became inflated.. Now their kids dont believe in capitalism, who can
blame them?

---

0% instead of 2% mortage can offset a 30% rise of cost of a home in 15
years. But the price rise we see for homes for that period is over
60%, due to speculation.

---

Low rates can help mortgage rates be lower, but low irates also create
a speculative environment whereby investors rush to real estate assets
inflating prices there, which wld erase any gains home buyers might
have enjoyed due to low rates. Wasn't this at the root of the 2007/8
crisis? They were giving mortages to dead people for effs sake.

---

Reverse correlation is visible. We see the brief 2018 rise in rates,
and housing prices falling.

---

Another reason why low interest rates are bad, it inflates house prices.
