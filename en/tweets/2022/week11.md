Fresh Prez of D.C. Russia Edition

---

It's likely he is precisely in jail bcz he could be an alternative,
i.e. the RU state actually could work with him. Either way in power he
cld be somewhat 'better' but I wouldn't expect a rosy character. Maybe
there would not be a Ukranian War Part II, but there wld be.. a Georgia?
A little Chechnia on the side?

---

Mind you, this is the opposition figure *in jail*.

The Atlantic: "[Navalny] supported Russia in its war against Georgia
in August 2008, using a derogatory term for Georgians in some of his
blog posts and calling for all Georgians to be expelled from
Russia. He has since apologized for using the racist epithet, but says
he stands by the other positions he took at that time"

---

Really? 

"Ew but things would be so much better with Aleksei Navalny"..

---

Remember the US firebombing of Tokyo, that was executed through air
raids, planes, dropping 2000 tons of bombs in 48 hours, killing over

bombing cities you'll understand why. 

"Why does this No-Fly Zone matter anyway?"

Blinken reminds me of that gov official in *Under Siege*; in the

H2 at $1.50/kg means 10.48 dollars/Gigajoules, in the range of the
table [here](../../2022/02/costs-lcoe.html) that beats natgas. NG is still
good, but Hysata's number is better.

---

Cosin is in Qinghai. Yep.. Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan, Shaanxi. All have
great potential. China can become energy independent, using
solar alone.

---

SolarPaces: "Cosin Solar.. seemed to burst on the global [CSP] scene
as a fully fledged Chinese CSP firm. Among China’s pilot projects, the
Supcon Delingha 50 MW tower CSP with 7 hours of storage in Qinghai
Province was among the few to succeed in China’s pilot program.

The project reached full load much faster than the first CSP projects
in the US.., and entering regular operation recorded by the government
by late 2019. I spoke with Cosin Solar Chairman Jin Jianxiang..

JJ: 'Many people who don’t know our background think we succeeded in
the first shot. In fact, we have been researching CSP technology for
over 12 years from lab tests to demonstration pilots..

From 2013 to 2015, through 3 years of experimental research, we
successfully solved the problems of mirror field control, heat
absorber tube burst, molten salt valve leak, electrical heat tracing
failure etc...

For the last 187 days, from 26th August 2021 to 28th February 2022, we
had 17 cloudy days and actually operated for 170 days. We’ve averaged
over 100% of expected generation for 103 of those days, and the
remaining 67 days were a little under 100%. During this period since
August last year, aggregate DNI was 1197 kWh/m², for a theoretical
production of 91 GWh. Yet our actual production was 92 GWh, and our
average power generation achievement rate was 101%"

H2 View: "[Michelin is] betting big on [H2, as] the energy carrier, as
[VP] Sabet made clear in his presentation. Through a vast array of
projects and collaborations, the company is expanding its footprint in
the hydrogen mobility space. Detailing one of many projects the
Michelin is currently working on, Sabet said, 'We are working on a
hydrogen corridor project. It was the first of its kind back in 2017
and it has a vision to create a hydrogen [station] corridor of 20
sites to refuel 1,200 vehicles.'

Hympulsion, a joint venture between Michelin and Engie, is making the
corridor come to life, having invested 8m [Eur] in deploying
refuelling stations and catalysts for distributing and producing
decarbonised hydrogen"

The change described below would mean adding a few Ukraine-level food
shortage issues on top of ones we already have.

NBC News: "The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change examined how agriculture will be affected by global warming, as
well as how food production and other changes in land use are expected
to contribute to climate change in the future. The panel concluded
that if average global temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius over the
pre-industrial average — something that previous reports by the panel
have suggested could happen by the end of the century — the risk of
food supply instabilities 'are projected to be very high,' according
to the report, which was written by more than 100 scientists from
around the world.

One of the key ways food production could be affected is by extreme
weather events. Studies have shown that climate change is increasing
both the frequency and severity of extreme weather, causing more
intense downpours during storms or lengthening extreme heat waves, for
example, which can disrupt crops or alter growing seasons.. 'In the
past, bad weather in one area has been compensated by perhaps better
weather in another, but some of our research has shown that as we move
toward 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the probability of major cereal
producers facing synchronous shocks in the same season goes way up,'
said Rosamond Naylor, director of the Center on Food Security and the
Environment at Stanford University"

Bloomberg: "Petro-Yuan Still Far-Fetched Even Amid Saudi Mulling Oil Deals"

---

The dollar system created an extremely lopsided world. If you think
about it, after RU invasion due to sanctions there was now the danger
for countries who want Russian gas would not be able to pay for the
Russian gas. Under the current system that payment can surely get cut,
but then the system itself comes into question.. "Who the muck are
they to dictate how two neighbors trade from the other side of the
world?"  will be the thought. Right? Wasn't "the inability to govern
from afar" the reason for US's own independence from Britain?

"To spur CSP industry advancement and achieve an energy cost goal of 5
cents per kWh [currently it is at 9 cents/kWh], the U.S. Department of
Energy’s (DOE’s) Gen3 CSP program funds research to explore the
potential of several heat transfer mediums... Investigating three heat
transfer materials: [the] liquid pathway (exploring use of molten salt
as a heat transfer material, led by NREL), a particle pathway (using
sand-like particles as a heat transfer material, led by Sandia
National Laboratories), and a third pathway exploring the use of gas
as heat transfer material (led by Brayton Energy).

In March of 2021, DOE down-selected among the three pathways to fund
further research into particle-based storage, but also created an
opportunity for NREL to further develop the liquid pathway over the
next two years"

Wiki: "The solar updraft tower.. is a design concept for a
renewable-energy power plant for generating electricity from low
temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide
greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central
base of a very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a
hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow
drives wind turbines, placed in the chimney updraft or around the
chimney base, to produce electricity"

Solar Chimney Power Plant? Seriously.

Most cryptos have predefined number of coins, no new money will be
created past certain time. Is this the answer?

I would not want a system that disallows new money creation by
design.. Money creation through private channels may not the way to
go, but through digital UBI maybe, which can be lent to businesses, as
"public credit"?

Such UBI could be somewhat inflationary but that's good, existing
wealth would be inflated away. 

---

'Private money creation has negative consequences' he says.. Because
it potentially allows limitless growth, with material usage
[implications](../../2021/03/less-is-more-hickel.html), and environmental
impact? He could be right.. 

---

He admitted bank credit is newly created money BTW. Most econs are not
even aware this is the case; their monkey theories always talk about
money being 'the veil of barter' - a completely false claim.

---

"In August the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney,
gave an interesting speech on ‘The growing challenges for monetary
policy in the current international monetary and financial system’, in
which he set out how the dollar based global monetary order is
untenable and will need replacing by a new system...

Carney has proposed a ‘synthetic hegemonic currency’ as a possible
basis for a new global monetary system. This would be comprised of a
number of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), as put forward by
Positive Money. A CBDC would provide a trusted public alternative to
private banks’ monopoly on electronic money, and would move us towards
a system where commercial banks are not freely able to create new
money as debt, as they currently do to massive negative economic,
social and environmental consequences.

Carney said the introduction of such CBDCs would 'be to the benefit of
citizens and businesses', and is a reform to the monetary system which
'could happen.' In fact the Bank of England is currently exploring the
idea"
