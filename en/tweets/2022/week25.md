# Week 25 

H2 Fuel News: "The Argentine province Tierra del Fuego, an island
region best recognized for its location at the very tip of South
America, is seeking to begin hydrogen production for economic
diversification as the world moves away from fossil fuels and toward
clean sources of energy.. For the local hydrogen production strategy,
the area is seeking $6 billion in investments"

---

H2 View: "Australian powerhouses in the running for [large] green
hydrogen project in New Zealand.. Southern Green Hydrogen, a joint
venture between Contact Energy and Meridian Energy, revealed Woodside
Energy and Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) are set to provide
detailed proposals to decide the selection of lead developer for the
Southern Green Hydrogen project"

---

"Chevron Eyes 2.5bn Investments in Low-Carbon Hydrogen.. Chevron plans
to spend about 2.5-billion¬†building up its hydrogen business this
decade as the oil major accelerates investment in low-carbon
technologies. Chevron will develop both green and blue hydrogen, said
Austin Knight, vice president of [‚Ä¶] The post Chevron Eyes $2.5bn
Investments in Low-Carbon Hydrogen appeared first on Hydrogen Central"

---

The Independent: "A man in Pennsylvania man died after he attempted to
light a cigarette while using an oxygen concentrator at his home in
North Coventry Township"

---

Good call

AFP: "Swimming to set up an 'open category' to allow transgender
athletes to compete. The new policy effectively bans them from taking
part in women's races"

---

Maybe we should just dig canals everywhere instead of building roads ü§®

---

Hah. Floating stuff vs land transport.. If you do the physics, that
would likely check out. Moving stuff horizontally on sea probably
takes less energy than on land, even with rail. There is that pesky
friction to worry about on land.. it messes up everything.

They also have a major drug trafficking problem - see the drug map
below.

"Bulgaria‚Äôs government faces collapse this week.. PM Kiril Petkov
sought to tackle rampant corruption and to take a strong position
against the Kremlin"

---

Overkill

NDTV: "China's mass testing mantra is building a waste mountain"

---

Hindustan Times: "Britain set for biggest rail strike in decades"

---

Segments about young people are getting old.. Funny. And sad.

---

News segment about "generation change"; the younger generation
supposedly wanting change and proposing stuff.. Even that is getting
old.

---

Hindustan Times: "UK pushed 100,000 people into poverty by lifting pension age"

---

ISR built a wall, created an unofficial border, then they go on the
other side of the wall and shoot bunch of people..

---

Near the border, meaning the man was shot on **his** side of the wall,
not on Israeli side.

---

WION: "53-year-old Palestinian man was killed by the Israeli forces
near the border in Qalqilya city."

---

If govs wanted drug traffickers can be hurt in a big way at the major
hubs, UK, Spain, Italy (which made a big bust recently). At sources
too naturally such as Colombia.

---

I wonder what Petro will do about the Colombian drug trade

---

The left in ascendance. 

The Independent: "Colombia picks 1st leftist president [Petro] in
tight runoff contest"

---

French leftist coalition earned second place in parliamentary seats,
Le Pen made some gains too..

---

Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, UK, Belgium are major end points in Europe.
Spain especially, crazy connectivity.

Iran - damn. Colombia, makes sense. 

China-Paraguay? There was that one 2012 major bust apparently, so it
shows on the map.

India, Australia, Germany, Japan are relatively clean. 

---

Taliban are jihadi mofos too, in a different way

---

Maybe "somebody" was bothered about their drug money being cut on the
Pakistani side, ppl with connection in mil and a line into the jihadi
m--f--kers used one of them to send a message.

---

Coincidence? Hmmm

CBC News: "Islamic State says attack on Sikh temple is revenge for Prophet insults"

---

DW: "[2022/6/2] Taliban start to enforce ban on poppy
cultivation.. Afghanistan‚Äôs Taliban rulers have begun a campaign to
eradicate poppy cultivation, aiming to wipe out the country‚Äôs massive
production of opium and heroin"

---

Pakistan became a **major** source for the drug trade; they are
Afghanistan's neighbor, their meddling, coup-loving military would
have long-time relations there, I'm sure many deep state gov officials
look the other way when drug trade is being conducted, if not
officially partake in it themselves.

---

Data from a UN agency, at least some vaguely proper data is there this
time, but every year's data is in a seperate Excel sheet. ??. I had to
write extra "preprocessing" code to combine stuff. Keep it simple.
Put data on Github so it is version controlled.

Fast Company: "Of course, the sun‚Äîand wind, for that matter‚Äîaren‚Äôt
always available, and certainly not everywhere. 'Heavy industry runs
24-7. You don‚Äôt find any factories that shut down and only run one
shift,' says Bill Gross, founder and CEO of Heliogen, a company that
stores as much thermal energy as possible to then convert to green
hydrogen, an alternative fuel..

'I feel it‚Äôs all about using science and technology to find a way to
beat that price of fossil fuel,' Gross says. Heliogen has built a
‚Äúsunlight refinery‚Äù: a setup whereby thousands of mirrors.. reflect
beams of sunlight.. onto a single spot at the top of a tower, the size
of a basketball hoop. That concentration allows the collected sunlight
to reach temperatures of more than 1,000 degrees Celsius.. 

It then stores that thermal energy in tanks of gravel. 'Imagine a
thousand pizza stones in an oven where you close the door after you‚Äôve
heated them up,' Gross says. 'Those are going to stay hot for a very
long time.' The energy can then be easily transported to less sunny
climes, wherever it‚Äôs needed. 'It allows us to run on cloudy days. It
allows us to run through any other kind of interruption. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs
crucial for the world because we all want to have uninterruptible
power.

They then convert that energy into green hydrogen via electrolysis,
which essentially splits the hydrogen from water (and an important
distinction from dirty hydrogen, which is traditionally produced from
methane). ‚ÄúWhen you burn hydrogen, it releases nothing,' Gross
says. 'It releases just water vapor to the atmosphere. That‚Äôs the
beauty of hydrogen.'"

H2 Central: "Engines equipped with H2-HPDI (High Pressure Direct
Injection) fuel systems run on hydrogen and offer a spectrum of
advantages over other technologies, making it possible to accelerate
H2 adoption as a component of sustainably operating heavy-duty
vehicles. Among the advantages of using H2-HPDI systems from¬†Westport
Fuel Systems¬†include its practicality for fleet managers that require
straightforward operations and maintenance in the transition toward
improved sustainability. Furthermore, engines equipped with these
systems can exceed the performance of current heavy-duty diesel
vehicles while simultaneously minimizing greenhouse gas emissions to
the point that they are nearly eliminated"

---

H2 Fuel News: "Pilot Company expands into compressed natural gas and
hydrogen: partners with VoltaGrid. Pilot Company, one of the leading
suppliers of fuel and the largest operator of travel centers in¬†North
America, announced that the company is building upon its current
initiatives in the alternative fuels space with a new compressed
natural gas (CNG) and hydrogen delivery platform. This expansion
includes a partnership with VoltaGrid LLC (‚ÄúVoltaGrid‚Äù) to develop a
low-carbon fuels network that contributes to reduced emissions and
decarbonization for third-party customers in industries like water
disposal, dual-fuel applications, water heating operations, and
natural disaster response"

H2 View: 'Nuvera Fuel Cells, LLC, a provider of heavy-duty hydrogen
fuel cell engines for on- and off-road mobility and other
applications, announces an order for an E-Series Fuel Cell Engine from
CMT, a propulsion technology research institute at the Universitat
Polit√®cnica de Val√®ncia, Spain. Focusing on accelerating the
widespread adoption of zero-emission vehicle power sources, CMT is
building a 200 kW fuel cell test bench facility in collaboration with
AVL, a worldwide engineering leader"

Al Monitor: "Saudi Arabia's futuristic planned city NEOM plans to
build a water desalination plant powered by renewable energy"

---

The increase in renewables is great, but we are still inching forward
megawatt by megawatt and 1 GW plant is considered a big deal. Still
tough to keep up with oil / natgas resources of eg US, Iran, Qatar or
Russia. Guy digs one hole in the ground and boom: 60 Gigawatts. Need
more? Another hole, boom. Another 60. Saudi Arabia's total energy
output is about 1 Terrawatt.

When dollar is strong, other countries have trouble securing the
dollars to buy the oil with, ergo oil demand (and global price)
decreases. Non-US demand would effect oil price more, there are more
people outside US.

The Balance: "When it comes to international trade for raw materials,
the dollar is the exchange mechanism... When the value of the dollar
drops, it costs more dollars to buy commodities. At the same time, it
costs a lesser amount of other currencies when the dollar is moving
lower"

---

Historically there was a reverse correlation between dollar and oil.
Strong dollar, weak oil, and vica versa. The relation broke recently
we'll see if it sticks. Is the petrodollar system broken already?

Italy's Rome went gone long time ago - that helped Italy

The coup culture is usually connected to a previous feudal culture;
Greece and Asia Minor suffered various coups because of their earlier
Roman / Byzantium / Ottoman past. Remember the Praetorian Guard? In
sum, if agrarian-taxer-plunderer parasitic-government culture becomes
entrenched, it creates the types of people in society who think anyone
with military power can and should take the reins by force. This is
the feudal way. Coups are, therefore, pre-modern creations experienced
in countries on the road towards modernity.

Quora: "Why there have been frequent military coups in Pakistan as
compared to it's neighbour India?..

The British always divided Hindus and Muslims by treating Muslims
preferentially by recruiting Muslims/Sikhs in army under the concept
of Martial races. Indian army had excessive percentage of Pujabi
Muslim Army units. The units were organised with people from single
regions or castes. They were led by British officers and this resulted
excessive allegiance by minority units like punjabi Muslims who
imitated British officers and this perceived superiority complex
exists even today in Pakistan society.  This was broken by India once
India became free and the rule of Martial races in recruitment was
buried. Chaudhries and sardars were thrown out of the window giving a
body blow to Feudals. Feudalism was weakened by land reforms.
Pakistan continued in the old ways.and new Feudals are the Army,
Sardars in NWFP, KPK, POK, Baluchstan, Bueraucrats, and now a small
bands of industrialists.

Janes Defense: "Reacting to pressure from NATO's former Warsaw Pact
members and Russia's brutal war tactics in Ukraine, the alliance is
ditching its thin, so-called tripwire line of defence along its
eastern flank for a military posture more redolent of decades past:
more troop deployments, more pre-positioned weapons and supplies
across the region, and a return to Cold War-like pre-designated areas
for particular allies to defend on short notice"

---

"A recent Bloomberg report called attention to the unwelcome but
predictable consequences of broad Russia sanctions: ‚ÄúBut some Biden
administration officials are now privately expressing concern that
rather than dissuading the Kremlin as intended, the penalties are
instead exacerbating inflation, worsening food insecurity and
punishing ordinary Russians more than Putin or his allies.‚Äù.. These
harmful effects of broad sanctions should not come as a surprise to
anyone that has followed these issues closely, since this is what
almost always happens when a country‚Äôs entire economy is targeted for
punishment. The inability to change the behavior of a targeted
government is even less surprising, since it is extremely rare for
unfriendly authoritarian states to knuckle under in the face of
U.S.-led pressure campaigns"
