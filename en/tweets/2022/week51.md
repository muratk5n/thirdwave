This is a real problem with "AI" -the current reincarnation of neural
networks with gazillions of free parameters-.

Paper: "We surmise silent bugs are especially insidious in [deep
learning] libraries and applications built on top of them. The primary
reason is that DL applications.. belong to the family of 'non-testable
program', for which, strictly speaking, oracles do not
exist. Moreover, finding such bugs in DL libraries can be very hard
and tedious. A DL model developed by a user typically consists of many
floating point parameters and operations (up to billions). Even with a
few bugs, the model may still be created, trained, and appeared to
work...  While there are various explanations for an unexpected
behaviour that need to be ruled out, the worst is the fact that the
faulty computation is not explicitly developed by the user, but
implicitly produced by the library. However, little information can be
obtained from the DL model’s internal mechanism and training/inference
due to the 'black-box' and stochastic nature of DL
training/inference. Hence, any bugs in DL libraries may lead to bugs
in the user’s program that the user might not, easily, become aware
of"

Reuters: "Germany's Gascade, Ontras and terranets have agreed to
convert high-pressure gas pipelines to transport low-carbon hydrogen
from the Baltic Sea all the way the south of the country by 2025, the
companies said on Thursday... The plan, dubbed "Flow - making hydrogen
happen" aims to convert existing high-pressure gas pipelines with
feed-in capacity of up to 20 gigawatt (GW), offering the equivalent of
the power capacity of 20 nuclear plants"

HTGR nuclear plants (see Japan, RU) don't have to be near the sea;
they are helium cooled. 

New Statesman: "If key financial investors don’t take up the remaining
60 per cent of construction costs, the planned Sizewell C [nuclear]
plant in Suffolk is going nowhere. The omens aren’t good. Recently Sir
Nigel Wilson, group CEO of Legal & General, one of the UK’s largest
real assets firms, told BBC Radio Four: 'We are not big fans of
Sizewell C.'.. King, the UK’s former chief scientific adviser and a
long-standing nuclear supporter, told LBC that the plant would be
'very difficult to protect from flooding' due to rising sea levels on
the Suffolk coast"

largest green hydrogen-based ammonia production plant in the planned
futuristic city.. The project, set to come on stream in 2026, is
expected to produce about 1.2 million tonnes of green ammonia per
year"

The adventures, horrors depicted in some nature-adventure, monster
whatnot movies are a throwback to an era when the nature dwarfed
humans. Not the case anymore. The giant 30 meter whale would be
conceptually more terrifying when humanity didn't have 300+ meter 100K
ton aircraft carrier.

An entire sea is disappearing. Modern world can do that now. 

"Formerly the fourth largest lake in the world with an area of 68,000
km2 (26,300 sq mi), the Aral Sea began shrinking in the 1960s after
the rivers that fed it were diverted by Soviet irrigation projects"

Why the rise? The "shitshow" in Libya opened the floodgates (Kaddafi
died 2011), about the same time Syrian civil war started, later we saw
the rise of IS, jihadi mofos everywhere went rabid, some in Africa no
doubt.

The CEIP article below seems to downplay the rise of terror attacks in
Africa btw 2012-2016, according to GTD counts went "from 114 attacks
and 1,944 fatalities in 2006, to 2,051 attacks and 13,182 fatalities
in 2016". I checked GTD (all incidents, all deaths, monthly, ends
2020-06), there is a spike. I'd call the increases significant. Since
2016 numbers went down now they are lower. See [post](../../2019/05/confstats.html#gtdafrica).

TFI Global: "Greek shipping companies have devised a smart plan to
evade European sanctions. From the Russian port of Kavkaz which lies
on the north of the Black Sea, Greek ships have loaded oil from the
Russian ships. The move effectively camouflaged Russian oil. Greece
ships were also engaged in ship-to-ship transfers. Greece has earned
billions of dollars of revenue from this exercise"

That would be a salt-cavern fyi; apparently the area is rich with such
formations

The Guardian: "The energy company SSE has begun work to develop an
underground cavern in east Yorkshire to store hydrogen, aiming to
stockpile the renewable source of power for when the freezing,
windless conditions experienced in the last week occur in future.

The project will produce hydrogen using renewable energy in a
35-megawatt electrolyser which will be stored in a cavern the size of
St Paul’s Cathedral located a mile deep at an existing SSE site in
Aldbrough on the Yorkshire coast"

Chemistry World: "A combined desalination–electrolysis system that can
produce green hydrogen directly from seawater has been developed by a
team in China...  Following successful laboratory trials, the team
were keen to demonstrate the practicality of this approach at scale
and installed a demo device in Shenzhen Bay. The compact unit ran for
an initial test period of 133 days producing over a million litres of
hydrogen without any evident corrosion of the catalyst or increase in
impurities"

The Herald: "Ministers have unveiled a plan to help Scotland become a
world leader in hydrogen production which they say could generate up
to £25 billion a year and provide more than 300,000 jobs.

The blueprint, published yesterday, sets out the sets they will take
to help meet the target of producing a sixth of the country's power
needs from hydrogen by 2030, some 5 Gigawatts.

A further goal is to produce 25 Gigawatts of hydrogen by 2045 - the
year the Scottish Government want the county to be net zero"

Smart how they compared different items on a multivariable plot; each
variable is a corner, better/worse numeric values bring you further or
closer to the center, you want the best item to be on the outside, a
connected ring envoloping all the others in that web, (clearly DBT in
this plot).

Compressed H2 is ok for short trips that can be made frequently due to
max capacity, it looks suitable for eg Oz-Japan not as much for
SA-Japan. I made some calcs below for 40 trips / year and a fleet of
20 ships, using 250 bar H2 having 700 kwh/m3,

```python
capacity = 120000 #m3
print ("Single ship %0.1f MW" % ((ship * 700) / (365*24*1e3)))
ann_trips = 40
print ("Fleet capacity %0.1f GW" % ((20 * ann_trips * capacity * 700) / (365*24*1e6)))
```

```text
Single ship 9.6 MW
Fleet capacity 7.7 GW
```

"@GutoOwenH2

The true test of an energy system is not the easy stuff but the
worst-case scenario. Resilience being the 1ary metric. The Herculean
efforts of the grid engineers is a failure of the system. And the
Pathé News-style spin would be laughable, if it was not so
serious. It's 2022"
