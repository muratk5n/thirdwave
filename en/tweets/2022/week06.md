H2 View: "A revolutionary new technology could be one of the ‚Äúmost
efficient methods‚Äù of transporting clean hydrogen within a 1,000-mile
radius..  The newly patented *Pipe-within-a-Pipe* technology.. can
efficiently transport hydrogen up to 1,000 miles inside virtually any
existing oil and gas pipeline, water pipe, sewer line, storm
drain.. [A] pipe is located inside a slightly larger diameter one,
referred to as a ‚Äúsafety pipe‚Äù that runs an inert gas in between the
two pipes to constantly sweep for hydrogen molecules"

With Germany setting up hydrogen offices from Moscow to Riyadh, one
would think the government is banking on the gas being the new
\#petroleum"

H2 View: "Hydrogen refuelling network to be developed in the US by
Daimler Truck, NextEra, LLC, and BlackRock"

---

H2 View: "India has started blending hydrogen into a City Gas
Distribution (CGD) network as the nation begins to ramp up hydrogen
adoption and accelerate its decarbonisation efforts"

---

H2 View: "France to gain hydrogen-powered regional aircraft as part of
new agreement"

German Greens are fine with all colors. Skeptics shld take notice.

DW: "Green is the color denoting the most environmentally friendly
hydrogen because it's made with renewable energies through
electrolysis and entirely free of CO2 emissions. Furthermore, there is
"blue hydrogen," which is derived from fossil gas but considered low
carbon because it uses carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology to
bury the related CO2 emissions underground. And finally, there's
"turquoise hydrogen," which is manufactured using natural gas
pyrolysis, a process that creates solid carbon as a byproduct instead
of CO2.

Like Germany's liberals, the European Commission has acknowledged all
four types of hydrogen are important for achieving carbon neutrality,
saying fossil-based H2 with carbon storage is a crucial stepping stone
in growing the hydrogen market in its early stages"

---

Another color.

H2 View: "[Ekona's 'turquise H2' tech] uses heat recovery and
combustion to generate the heat energy and high temperatures that are
required to drive the methane splitting reaction. In addition to this,
the platform is low-cost, scalable, and can be flexibly sited wherever
natural gas infrastructure exists."

---

Green fuels can handle both long and short distances. For TCO and econ
reasons it will be adopted at the exclusion of the rest. Why bother
with two seperate tech when u can do with one? This is Betamax over
VHS territory. Tech adoption does not do participation trophies.

"Batteries can do the short distances, green hydrogen can do the long distances"

---

But of course it's good to fix shipping as well as everything else. 

"Shipping..  [is responsible for 1.7% of] emissions.. This includes
both passenger and freight maritime trips."

H2 View: "A major breakthrough in the hydrogen fuel cell industry has
been achieved with Chart Industries and Ballard Power Systems
successfully testing a fuel cell powered by liquid hydrogen... With
this, using liquid hydrogen could allow for up to double the range
without space claim and payload impacts, and simplified fuelling
infrastructure for heavy-duty mobility applications such as class-8
trucks, buses, rail, and marine"

Likes H2 doesn't like crypto. üëç

"Forrest, ... chairman of Fortescue Metals Group, said he was taking
the action to stop people losing money to clickbait advertising scams,
such as ones using his image to promote cryptocurrency schemes [and is
suing Meta]"

"World‚Äôs largest green hydrogen project, with 150MW electrolyser,
brought on line in China"

Offshore production is dangerous. The ship/offshore setup is weird,
processing is on the ship? Then the ship sinks. Let's not have any
fossil on any ships. No fossil on any transport. No offshore. No
fracking. No flaring. Green fuels only.

Yahoo! News: "Two-million-barrel oil tanker 'explodes' off Nigeria's
coast.. The Trinity Spirit is a type of ship used by the offshore oil
and gas industry for the production and processing and storage of
oil. These models have a similar function to larger oil rigs"

---

Apparently a pipeline broke.. This is what happens when u transport
fossil! 

Al Jazeera: "Some 6,300 barrels of oil leaked into a natural reserve
in Ecuador in a protected area of the Amazon"

---

Maybe a [parallel to econ](../../2022/01/particles-and-ai.md#econ) will help

"I still dont get the comment on the particle / formula distinction"

---

Trick for pickled vegs; sometimes mfkers overdo the vinegar, or lemon
in the preserving liquid, so drain, poke some holes on vegs with fork,
then put fresh water in its place. The liq inside veg will seep out
back to the water, overall same flavor but lighter.

---

New scifi show in the works? *The Ark*? Some Stargate names are attached to the
project apparently. Could be good..

---

I hear the latest install has gone overboard on overcuck

"@sargentali

As much as I love that Paris is Big‚Äôs final resting place, I feel
obligated to point out that scattering ashes into the Seine is
illegal. Sorry Carrie '\#andjustlikethat I got a ‚Ç¨15,000 fine‚Ä¶'"

*Firefly* reboot on Disney Plus? Great.

And.. don't f--k it up

Is the great theme music era over? Magnum PI, Hawaii 5-O. That was
some great theme music..

He was fired from CNN yes, for being anti-semitic or something.. which
can mean anything these days

---

Marc Lamont Hill is good on Al Jazeera. He asked tough q to an
official on vax patents and gov funding - that guy was sweatin'

---

Didn't Renzi try a constitution change once, was it around this issue?
If yes, someone should pick that up again. Actually just do the
change, ask ppl later if they liked it.

---

Let people chose reps, fine.. I am against asking them on policies.

---

Italian parliament cld switch to a ranked-choice voting, that way
someone is chosen for Prez for sure.

Or let people elect the President direct, like Renzi said...

---

People say many things; I am sure things are changing, but culture
codes change very slowly..

"But Brits say class is not an issue anymore"

---

UK's culture code for itself is CLASS (whereas in US it is DREAM)..A
lot of issues are probably perceived through the prism of
class... Parties made PM look high-society, posh, although BJ himself
doesn't come across that way. 

"Partygate paradox: Why are Brits so obsessed with Boris Johnson's parties?"

---

Gina Raimondo is on the globalizer camp according to reports. Wiki
says her father lost his job to outsourcing (China) back in the day.

---

Alfred Nobel never wanted an econ prize, his relatives say [kill it](../../2018/05/faux-nobel.md)
today. Rabid speculators like Sholes won it before, 1997, a year before his
hedge fund would crash using his "Nobel level" techniques, causing bunch
of collateral damage around it. 

---

Much remains to do in econ. Until some natural sciences level stuff is
achieved, the Nobel Prize for econ needs to be canceled. 

---

Real potential GDP, in FRED `GDPPOT` is being tracked. Cool.. For
ppl who like to play with such variables there is a wealth of data out
there.

---

According to Fed's Fred covid recession only lasted for two months,
Feb 2020 - Apr 2020. Seems short.
