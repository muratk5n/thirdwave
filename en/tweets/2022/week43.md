# Week 43 

H2 Central: "Members of The European Parliament Have Decided to
Support a Hydrogen Based Green Transition in The Transport
Sector.. Was another important day for hydrogen economy in Europe and
globally... [The target of a] maximum distance of 100km between each
hydrogen refuelling station, along both the core and comprehensive
TEN-T networks, will mean that by the time the infrastructure is in
place by end of 2027, up to 1,780 HRS could be available across
Europe, suppling up to 1 million ton of hydrogen per year"

Later they fudged QED results six more times

Consa: "With the new experimental data from Franken and Liebes.. [t]he
probative force of QED was upended... It was a fraud, a scandal.  But
the creators of QED refused to accept defeat. QED could not be an
incorrect theory because that placed them in an indefensible
situation. All the developments in the field of theoretical physics
that had occurred in the last decade were based on this theory. All
the privileges they had obtained after the success of the Manhattan
Project were at stake"

---

Dyson reconciled Feynman, Schwinger QED theories, which were
themselves subpar. Infinities are swept under the rug, techniques
Dirac thought illegitimate mathematics were used. The post-war rut in
physics started in the Shelter Island conference, New York.

---

Consa: "According to Dyson, [Physicist Enrico] Fermi also did not
agree with this new way of conducting science.. Fermi asked how many
free parameters he had used to obtain the fit. Smiling after being
told 'Four,' Fermi remarked, 'I remember my old friend Johnny von
Neumann used to say, with four parameters I can fit an elephant, and
with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.'"

---

Oliver Consa: "Something is rotten in the state of [Quantum
Electrodynamics. QED] is considered the most accurate theory in the
history of science. However, this precision is based on a single
experimental value: the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron
(g-factor). An examination of QED history reveals that this value was
obtained using illegitimate mathematical traps, manipulations and
tricks"

"@schumacherbj

When you are ready to switch fields for your Postdoc"

---

$A^T A$ is surprisingly easy to switch to concurrency.

---

If $A$ is "tall and skinny" ie $A$ is m x n where n is much smaller
than m, there is some trickery using $A^T A$. A can have lots of rows
but $A^T A$ has to be n x n -by definition- which is small. 

---

A lot of linear algebra can be paralelized. Even SVD.

Davis: "Since Russia long ago destroyed the bulk of Ukraine’s ability
to produce military equipment and ammunition, Kyiv is wholly dependent
on a non-stop stream of supplies from the West. The greatest threat to
Ukraine’s ability to wage war, therefore, is the security of supply
routes from their western borders to marshalling locations in the
interior of their country. If Putin recognizes this vulnerability, he
may mass his forces through Belarus again, but bypass Kyiv completely
and strike towards Ukraine’s western borders"

Deep neural nets are used in ad-hoc fashion, shove data from one end,
turn the crank, it spits out some stuff from the other end. Their
non-scientific nature made them a dead-end route for AGI. Any

TabPFN has a connection to theory, a positive development; they can

The new eLife approach can work... Every submitted paper is
automatically available (not 'rejected', or 'accepted'), publisher
assesment is still included with the published paper, others' comments
also visible, and the author can resubmit.

I'm thinking incentives.. prestigious publishers can still exist, to
the extent they can pull prestigious reviewers, the add-on they
provide will be those reviews. Readers would still be able to get a
feel of a up/down vote on the paper, but the paper is available either
way, available for others to see/comment.

"@MazzucatoM

When [the] @WIRED ⁩piece was written, capitalism still had (weak)

rethink fundamentals"

---

Wired: "[2019] What.. infuriated [the economist] Mazzucato was the
prevailing narrative that [gov spending] cuts were necessary to boost
competitiveness and innovation... 'There was this belief that we
didn’t have European Googles and Facebooks because we didn’t subscribe
to Silicon Valley’s free market approach. It was just ideology: there
was no free market in Silicon Valley.'..

[Mazzucato researched the issue]. The development of Google’s search
algorithm, for instance, had been supported by a grant from the
National Science Foundation, a US public grant-awarding body... Many
other well-known US startups had been funded by the Small Business
Innovation Research programme, a public venture capital fund. 'It
wasn’t just early research, it was also applied research, early stage
finance, strategic procurement,' she says. 'The more I looked, the
more I realised: state investment is everywhere.'"
