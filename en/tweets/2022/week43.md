# Week 43 

"JCB, developer of the world’s first working construction machines
powered by hydrogen, today unveiled another world first for the
industry - a mobile hydrogen refueller. JCB is investing £100 million
in a project to produce super-efficient hydrogen engines and has
already showcased working prototypes of a backhoe loader and Loadall
telescopic handler powered by hydrogen"

Deep neural nets are used in ad-hoc fashion, shove data from one end,
turn the crank, it spits out some stuff from the other end. Their
non-scientific nature made them a dead-end route for AGI. Any
theoretical connection to their use is a good thing.

---

TabPFN has a connection to theory, a positive development; they can
*prove* something, an approximation to Bayesian inference. In effect
TabPFN is almost an implementation of theory, as FVM can implement
CFD.

"TabPFN: A Transformer That Solves Small Tabular Classification
Problems in a Second.. TabPFN is radically different from previous ML
methods. It is a meta-learned algorithm and it provably approximates
Bayesian inference"

"The US Department of Energy (DOE) has released a draft National Clean

the targeting of strategic, high-impact uses of hydrogen; reducing the

deployment of at least four regional clean hydrogen hubs"

More on heritage and how little it matters. C. Rapaille is

is from his book *The Culture Code*.

The new eLife approach can work... Every submitted paper is
automatically available (not 'rejected', or 'accepted'), publisher
assesment is still included with the published paper, others' comments
also visible, and the author can resubmit.

I'm thinking incentives.. prestigious publishers can still exist, to
the extent they can pull prestigious reviewers, the add-on they
provide will be those reviews. Readers would still be able to get a
feel of a up/down vote on the paper, but the paper is available either
way, available for others to see/comment.

H2 Central: "War Drives $73bn Spend on Green Hydrogen.... Germany,
Morocco and the United States have pledged most, the report
finds. Production, on the other hand, will be dominated by the Global
South, responsible for 50% of total world production by 2050, with
South Africa, Morocco and Chile controlling most (68 million tonnes)"

Climate models are fine 4-5 days ahead on general weather (Ian was
predicted, even the Lee County landfall) but flood tech does sound
behind. Base data should already be there, terrain, wind,
rainfall. The rest is fluid dynamics.

"[S]everal shortcomings in the..  Earth System Model..  [attempting to
predict flooding] including those related to model structure, lack of
mechanistic representation of key processes, and coarse spatial
resolution, pose limits"

Bhadrakumar: "The EU has now become a captive market for Big Oil and
is left to buy LNG from the US at the asking price, which is six to
seven times higher than the domestic price in the US.. The Americans
are cocooned in a surreal world of their self-serving narrative that
Russia ‘lost’ the war. In the real world, though [.. things look
different]"

Calling a function instead of passing the function pointer.. rookie
`multiprocessing` mistake. `Pool(func(arg1,arg2))` instead of
`Pool(func,args=(arg1,arg2))`.. Tsck, tsck, tsck.. Then programmer
wonders why everything is running serially not paralel. You paralized
the mufucka that's why.

H2 Central: "[H2] has potential as a source for electricity in our
homes: South Korea opened a hydrogen fuel cell plant last year—the
world’s largest—that will supply power to 250,000 households
annually... In Japan.. there are 400,000 residential fuel cell units
helping to power individual homes"

"@MazzucatoM

When [the] @WIRED ⁩piece was written, capitalism still had (weak)
legs. Now it’s looking for crutches. No better time than this to
rethink fundamentals"

---

Wired: "[2019] What.. infuriated [the economist] Mazzucato was the
prevailing narrative that [gov spending] cuts were necessary to boost
competitiveness and innovation... 'There was this belief that we
didn’t have European Googles and Facebooks because we didn’t subscribe
to Silicon Valley’s free market approach. It was just ideology: there
was no free market in Silicon Valley.'..

[Mazzucato researched the issue]. The development of Google’s search
algorithm, for instance, had been supported by a grant from the
National Science Foundation, a US public grant-awarding body... Many
other well-known US startups had been funded by the Small Business
Innovation Research programme, a public venture capital fund. 'It
wasn’t just early research, it was also applied research, early stage
finance, strategic procurement,' she says. 'The more I looked, the
more I realised: state investment is everywhere.'"
