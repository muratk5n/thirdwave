"Influential analyst [Michael Liebreich] says the world will not be
able to produce renewable energy fast enough to decarbonise hydrogen,
power, steel, transport and heating at the same time. 'We have to
learn to love blue hydrogen. Maybe in an ideal world, we wouldn‚Äôt, but
we do,.. meeting the coming demand from sectors that would almost
certainly need clean H2 to decarbonise, such as steel, shipping and
long-term energy storage ‚Äî would require five times the current
installed global wind and solar capacity"

Silicon production, solar panels.

---

For countries, esp. developing, focusing on Coal-H2+CCS route makes
sense; most countries have coal, no problem securing supply. Can scale
output up and down wout being restricted by land availability,
panels. The rest would be perfecting the chemistry, optimizing
industrial processes.

---

CCUS, H2 generation, there are known processes for stuff. Coal is
plentiful. What's the holdup?

Asked a prof if coal-methane then H2 is doable, says coal-syngas is
easier.

"[T]hrough gasification (H2 + CO), then water gas shift
(H2O + CO --> H2 + CO2) so then what you have at the end is H2 + CO2.
You can either capture the CO2 with an amine leaving H2 with some CO2 in it,
or you use pressure swing adsorption to capture H2 at high purity, leaving
CO2 with H2 in it"

Holy Coal. China uses a lot of coal. The digging on those mines would
be at insane levels.

Let's remember the numbers, Nordstream is 65 GW each, Fukushima (was)
5 GW, the largest solar plant is 2.25GW, 1 GW is considered quite
large for solar, Ghawar oil field output is 269 GW.

---

China consumes a whopping 4998 GW, nearly twice as US does at this
point; makes sense for the world's manufacturer. India has a lot of
people. Japan's usage pretty low for a country its size, I'm guessing
due to energy savings... Germany is at 400 Gigawatts.

Energy (all energy) consumption per country (in GW)

Annual TWh consumption is divided by 365*24, gives wattage

This is what you get when u index writings of white-collar office

I search "coal consumption percentage of energy in germany" Google
answers "As of 2020, around 24% of the **electricity** in the country
is generated from coal." - Bold font is mine.

ELECTRICITY DOES NOT EQUAL ALL ENERGY 

---

The `_imp` columns are imports for that energy source. The right
column is in percentage.

---

Wind and solar is about 6% of their energy consumption.

I dont think that's true... Checking the BP file

"Germany generates half of its energy through renewables"

---

Producer can send clean fuel over pipes, if natgas is sent it is
converted at the receiving end.

Ammonia is sent via ship, if LNG is used, a plant at the port does the
conversion. #H2

---

In terms of clean energy transition (not necessarily exclusively
renewables based) priority-wise my vote is going gung-ho on blue
H2 + CCUS. Let's convert every bit of CH4 (natgas) into H2
whereever possible.

---

The new CEO is somewhat less for electrification (good), talks abt
e-fuels though that mechanism is tough to streamline.. E-fuels are
synthetic fuels which use carbon through budgeting schemes that makes
fuel 'carbon neutral' (car remains unchanged). 

Let's not forget how these muckers cheated with their emissions before.

I saw vids of chefs making the pizza and while they add the sauce they
only referenced the tomatoes, sometimes where they are from, but that
was it.

---

There

"Whereas the pizza sauce I lazily pick up from Trader Joe‚Äôs
refrigerator section [is..] loaded with spices, the pizzas in Italy
had very fresh tasting sauce, without much else in them. Could it
really as simple as using crushed tomatoes alone? After a bit more
research, I found that my suspicion was correct"

---

The sauce is only tomatoes IMO, nothing crazy.

Neapolitan pizza looks easy to make

H2 Central: "[T]he Wyoming Energy Authority has released a roadmap
that outlines the path to building a hydrogen economy in the state...
'Hydrogen‚Äôs role as a decarbonized energy carrier with unprecedented
transportation and consumption utility makes this a truly
transformational opportunity for the entire state.'

Hydrogen can be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks ‚Äì including
coal, natural gas, wind and even nuclear power ‚Äì bringing the
potential to help sustain the wide variety of Wyoming‚Äôs abundant
natural reserves. In addition, hydrogen‚Äôs flexible structure can be
converted and transported in various ways, allowing Wyoming to utilize
its existing infrastructure, including an extensive natural gas
transmission system.

Hydrogen can also be added to existing raw low-value energy sources to
significantly increase the resiliency of Wyoming‚Äôs value chain and
provide processing opportunities within the state"

---

H2 Central: "While scaling up the production of electrolyser systems is paramount,
the importance of how green hydrogen will be transported cannot be
overstated...

For distances below 1,500km, transporting hydrogen as a gas via
pipeline is ‚Äúgenerally the cheapest delivery option‚Äù; above 1,500km,
shipping hydrogen as ammonia or an LOHC may be more cost-effective, it
said, citing data from the International Energy Agency‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Future
of hydrogen ‚Äì Seizing today‚Äôs opportunities‚Äô report"

US needs gun control for the police, and specifically for the
police. That would change their conduct, interactions with the
people.. Right now they are probably confronting every situation while
thinking abt when to pull out a gun.

going after a suspect who never fired a gun"

Baba Vanga predictions.. "a psycic seer" who died 1996.. Two of the
2022 predictions came true apparently, floods and drought. Now let's
assume this psycic truly had some skill, some wires crossed in the
"simulation" and information is leaking and that is what's being
reported...

But the predictions are still open to interpretation. Like one that
said "the Russian city of Kursk would be covered with water and the
whole world will weep over it".  Nothing happened to the city, but the
the Kursk *submarine* sank and 118 military personnel died. So a name
and a general nationality was right, the sinking, the scale is
completely off. How do we treat other predictions now? One mentions
alien invasion, does that simply mean alien signals being confirmed,
or outright invasion? We don't know.

Davis: "Bucking Basic (Western) Beliefs: Ukraine is in far worse shape
than portrayed ‚Äì¬†Ukrainian officials claim their forces are ready to
launch a ‚Äúmillion-man offensive‚Äù against Russian forces next month,
while retired U.S. generals talk confidently about the war ending on
Ukraine‚Äôs terms by the end of this year. But an unemotional and
realistic assessment of the war‚Äôs most likely trajectory paints a
different picture...

Ukraine War Scenario Two: Russian Capture of Kharkiv & Odessa.. 

If Kharkiv falls, Ukraine will have even fewer troops left with which
to defend Odessa. If Russia were to mobilize enough men, it is
conceivable that they could invest Odessa even before Kharkiv was
completely captured. But whether simultaneously or sequentially, if
Russia moved on Odessa they would almost certainly employ the same
strategy they‚Äôve used countless times already in this war, surround
the city, cut off its defenders, and then crush the city with
saturating firepower.

If Russia were to successfully take both Kharkiv and Odessa (after
having taken the Donbas before), then Russia would essentially be in
control of all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper River. .. Once the
fighting gets to that point, however, Ukraine will have effectively
lost the war. The chances of it ever regaining any lost territories
would be virtually nil"
