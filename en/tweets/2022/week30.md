Take Germany. Their numerous *Mittelstand* the small-to-mid size
businesses represent the depth of that type of knowledge. There will
be one obscure guy producing some funky valve that noone in the world
produces. And guess what, he finds customers and can charge top dollar
(or euros). Further innovation builds on top of this diversity, if you
want to build a clean-fuel combustion engine, chances are you will
find the parts, the know-how associated with the subcomponents of that
engine.

Producing a piece, any piece of a "globalized supply chain" doesn't
necessarily get you there. Producing the cap of Coke bottles makes
country part of the supply chain but won't provide much deep
knowledge.

---

As [Hidalgo](../../2017/08/economic-complexity-hidalgo.html) proved,
know-how is what makes economies tick and countries to advance (not
necessarily "education" which doesn't always translate into actionable
knowledge). Hidalgo measures this through the diversity of products a
country produces, which is a sign of the depth of a country's
actionable skillset.

Davis: "It would take a country the size of Ukraine the better part of
a decade and a massive level of support from friendly nations to
recover from the devastation the Ukraine military has already
suffered. The idea that the UAF – or the armed forces of any nation on
earth – can recover from the level of destruction they’ve suffered to
date and rebuild the strength necessary to drive an invader out while
at the same time fighting an existential battle, is flatly
unrealistic.

Russia continues to take severe losses itself. Putin’s forces are not
immune to the consequences of losing trained and experienced
personnel, but as previously noted, Russia has millions more men from
which to draw new conscripts and hundreds of thousands of other active
troops that can be repurposed to ground combat. It is by no means
guaranteed that Russia would be able to achieve total victory over
Ukraine, but the fundamentals are present to give the idea some chance
of success. For Ukraine, however, there is minuscule chance of winning
and a higher probability of failure if they try to launch an
offensive.

An unemotional assessment of this war would lead to the conclusion
that the Ukrainian political leadership should seek the
best-negotiated settlement it could get now, while it still has
complete control of Kharkiv, Odesa, and most of Donetsk Oblast – and
before another significant city is turned to rubble and tens of
thousands more of its citizens killed or wounded"

said in a speech in Romania on Saturday... Orban said this strategy

Ukraine will never win the war this way 'quite simply because the
Russian army has assymetrical dominance'.

power, steel, transport and heating at the same time. 'We have to
learn to love blue hydrogen. Maybe in an ideal world, we wouldn’t, but
we do,.. meeting the coming demand from sectors that would almost
certainly need clean H2 to decarbonise, such as steel, shipping and
long-term energy storage — would require five times the current
installed global wind and solar capacity"

For countries, esp. developing, focusing on Coal-H2+CCS route makes
sense; most countries have coal, no problem securing supply. Can scale
output up and down wout being restricted by land availability,

Asked a prof if coal-methane then H2 is doable, says coal-syngas is
easier.

"[T]hrough gasification (H2 + CO), then water gas shift
(H2O + CO --> H2 + CO2) so then what you have at the end is H2 + CO2.
You can either capture the CO2 with an amine leaving H2 with some CO2 in it,
or you use pressure swing adsorption to capture H2 at high purity, leaving
CO2 with H2 in it"

Holy Coal. China uses a lot of coal. The digging on those mines would

China consumes a whopping 4998 GW, nearly twice as US does at this
point; makes sense for the world's manufacturer. India has a lot of

I dont think that's true... Checking the BP file

"Germany generates half of its energy through renewables"

---

Producer can send clean fuel over pipes, if natgas is sent it is
converted at the receiving end.

Ammonia is sent via ship, if LNG is used, a plant at the port does the
conversion. #H2

---

In terms of clean energy transition (not necessarily exclusively
renewables based) priority-wise my vote is going gung-ho on blue
H2 + CCUS. Let's convert every bit of CH4 (natgas) into H2
whereever possible.

The new CEO is somewhat less for electrification (good), talks abt

synthetic fuels which use carbon through budgeting schemes that makes

"Whereas the pizza sauce I lazily pick up from Trader Joe’s

had very fresh tasting sauce, without much else in them. Could it
really as simple as using crushed tomatoes alone? After a bit more

H2 Central: "[T]he Wyoming Energy Authority has released a roadmap
that outlines the path to building a hydrogen economy in the state...
'Hydrogen’s role as a decarbonized energy carrier with unprecedented
transportation and consumption utility makes this a truly
transformational opportunity for the entire state.'

Hydrogen can be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks – including
coal, natural gas, wind and even nuclear power – bringing the
potential to help sustain the wide variety of Wyoming’s abundant
natural reserves. In addition, hydrogen’s flexible structure can be
converted and transported in various ways, allowing Wyoming to utilize
its existing infrastructure, including an extensive natural gas
transmission system.

Hydrogen can also be added to existing raw low-value energy sources to
significantly increase the resiliency of Wyoming’s value chain and
provide processing opportunities within the state"

---

H2 Central: "While scaling up the production of electrolyser systems is paramount,
the importance of how green hydrogen will be transported cannot be
overstated...

For distances below 1,500km, transporting hydrogen as a gas via
pipeline is “generally the cheapest delivery option”; above 1,500km,
shipping hydrogen as ammonia or an LOHC may be more cost-effective, it
said, citing data from the International Energy Agency’s ‘The Future
of hydrogen – Seizing today’s opportunities’ report"

Baba Vanga predictions.. "a psycic seer" who died 1996.. Two of the
2022 predictions came true apparently, floods and drought. Now let's
assume this psycic truly had some skill, some wires crossed in the
"simulation" and information is leaking and that is what's being
reported...

But the predictions are still open to interpretation. Like one that
said "the Russian city of Kursk would be covered with water and the
whole world will weep over it".  Nothing happened to the city, but the
the Kursk *submarine* sank and 118 military personnel died. So a name
and a general nationality was right, the sinking, the scale is
completely off. How do we treat other predictions now? One mentions
alien invasion, does that simply mean alien signals being confirmed,
or outright invasion? We don't know.

Davis: "Bucking Basic (Western) Beliefs: Ukraine is in far worse shape
than portrayed – Ukrainian officials claim their forces are ready to
launch a “million-man offensive” against Russian forces next month,
while retired U.S. generals talk confidently about the war ending on
Ukraine’s terms by the end of this year. But an unemotional and
realistic assessment of the war’s most likely trajectory paints a
different picture...

Ukraine War Scenario Two: Russian Capture of Kharkiv & Odessa.. 

If Kharkiv falls, Ukraine will have even fewer troops left with which
to defend Odessa. If Russia were to mobilize enough men, it is
conceivable that they could invest Odessa even before Kharkiv was
completely captured. But whether simultaneously or sequentially, if
Russia moved on Odessa they would almost certainly employ the same
strategy they’ve used countless times already in this war, surround
the city, cut off its defenders, and then crush the city with
saturating firepower.

If Russia were to successfully take both Kharkiv and Odessa (after
having taken the Donbas before), then Russia would essentially be in
control of all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper River. .. Once the
fighting gets to that point, however, Ukraine will have effectively
lost the war. The chances of it ever regaining any lost territories
would be virtually nil"
