Netan is back from a year in limbo. I guess the electorate saw things
did not get visibly better with others, had more chaos (the al Jazeera
journo died on their watch) so power goes back to the worn-out old

properly on the US media with his American accent.

Cores are still preferable to GPUs for massively paralel archs
(sometimes both can be used in conjunction). CPUs can run anything,
with proper algo most 'number crunching' can be paralelized through
them. GPU's speciality is simple, micro operations.

The only criticism I had on Lula in the past was handling of his
succession.. Looking at the no-holds-barred nature of Brazil's
politics, IMHO, he should've picked someone politically feisty,
gregarious, knows economics, and a guy - basically younger version of
himself. He picked the former guerilla hot chica, it didn't work out
too well. Dilma was fine but the aftermath proved otherwise.. I don't
think the schemin, cretin muckers of Brazil politics could've pulled
off what they did on Lula himself when he was president.
