The only criticism I had on Lula in the past was handling of his
succession.. Looking at the no-holds-barred nature of Brazil's
politics, IMHO, he should've picked someone politically feisty,
gregarious, knows economics, and a guy - basically younger version of
himself. He picked the former guerilla hot chica, it didn't work out
too well. Dilma was fine but the aftermath proved otherwise.. I don't
think the schemin, cretin muckers of Brazil politics could've pulled
off what they did on Lula himself when he was president.

H2 Central: "BDR Thermea switches on hydrogen heating pilot in
Germany.. Pure hydrogen is running through the natural gas pipelines
in Holzwickede, Germany, heating three commercial properties"

Too many headlines with "migrant boat sank in the Medi". Are they
*being sunk* by shadowy operators from coastal countries?

H2 View: "German and New Zealand airports partner on hydrogen
developments..  Although [far] apart, the airports of Hamburg,
Germany, and Christchurch, New Zealand, have signed a partnership to
work on developing the use of green hydrogen in aviation"

Dems around the country are on the ropes. Rough times.

Walker still ahead on this poll.. and this is after Dems threw boat

One teaspoon of cumin is equivalent to one aspirin says doc. Similar

Wisdom of the crowds works when the decision is commensurate to the
knowledge of the crowd. For a very tough medical diagnosis the
combination of 10 cardiologists can work better than one. But 1
million random people cannot make a decision worth even one good
doctor.

---

Voters indirectly contribute into governance.. when they vote their
pocket, on the incumbent, they can indirectly vote in the person (who
should have different policy set) that can fix their problem. It's all
crab walk, sideways, indirect. No need to read too much into (or
expect miracles from) it. Want something changed? Jump into the fray
and lead.

FBI NIBRS crime (master) dataset has 45 mil records for one year, and

H2 View: "Turquoise hydrogen made from pyrolysis is efficient, clean
and potentially even carbon negative, according to a â€˜Pyrolysis:
Potential and possible applications of a climate friendly hydrogen
productionâ€™ report. The report, from Hydrogen Europe in collaboration
with the German Technical and Scientific Association for Gas and Water
(DVGW), was published this week.. 

Its appeal is that [the hardware] can be installed at point of use
wherever there is methane, thereby avoiding large infrastructure
CAPEX, and it uses minimal electricity, making it more competitive
than green hydrogen in a high electricity price environment"

I see.. now that I think about it the attack came across as bizarrely
assertive in an ill-timed kind of way..  the hallmark of the previous
administration? (remember the tax cut debacle). Then possibly Tory
members got wind, plus the tax thing, MPs toppled the gov in a jif.

The West is getting Putinsplained

Putin: "The so-called 'cancel culture' is in reality the cancellation
of culture, is eradicating everything that is alive and creative and
stifles free thought in all areas, be it economics, politics.. Today,
liberal ideology itself has changed beyond recognition. If initially,
classic liberalism was understood to mean the freedom of every person
to do and say as they pleased, in the 20th century the liberals
started saying that the so-called open society had enemies and that
the freedom of these enemies could and should be restricted if not
cancelled"

BEV li-on battery fires are incredibly hard to put out as the fire is
self-oxidizing.. Extremely stupid tech.

AccuWeather: "Electric vehicles catch aflame during Ian aftermath..
in the wake of the Category 4 hurricane that hit the state last month,
these vehicles have been more akin to a time bomb. Saltwater flooding
in the stateâ€™s coastal areas caused the lithium ion batteries in
electric vehicles to combust, catching fire.. Eric Wachsman, director
of Marylandâ€™s Energy Institute, stated that the qualities of lithium
ion battery cells.. make these cells vulnerable to ignition, due to
the cells having closely placed electrodes that are filled with a
flammable liquid electrolyte.

Apparently Rust has some memory check features, better than C (current
language suppored by the kernel). Memory management is the source of a
lot of bugs, security issues, especially at that low-level coding a
kernel requires.

Politico: "Gavin Newsom has quietly constructed one of the biggest

million phone numbers. Itâ€™s a massive tool, and itâ€™s led to a logical

Reuters: "Spain, Portugal and France said on Thursday they will build
a sea-based pipeline to carry hydrogen and gas between Barcelona and
Marseille, substituting plans to extend the so-called MidCat pipeline
across the Pyrenees that France opposed.

The route, dubbed BarMar, will mainly be used to pump green hydrogen
and other renewable gases but will also temporarily allow for the
transportation of a "limited amount" of natural gas to help alleviate
Europe's energy crisis, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said"

"Biohydrogen is H2 that is produced biologically..The biological
hydrogen production with algae is a method of photobiological water
splitting which is done in a closed photobioreactor based on the
production of hydrogen as a solar fuel by algae. Algae produce
hydrogen under certain conditions. In 2000 it was discovered that if
C. reinhardtii algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the
production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production
of hydrogen'

Africa is our hunter-gatherer history - the concept of a kingdom

their kingdoms (perhaps to their detriment) are the oldest.

On the contrary, pre-agriculture free speech was our default
setting. People keep forgetting there were humans before towns, kings,
farming and armies, before "civilization". We've lived that way for
300K years, only for 10K in comparison as villagers, near domesticated
plants and animals.

"@hankgreen

[I]t should maybe be said that [free speech] is all brand new and no
human (or human institution) has ever dealt with anything like it
before, so I'm not surprised that we're bad at it and don't know what
to do"

There was a rumor a week ago a coup was attempted on Zee Ping Ping,

attempt clearly didn't work, and the rumor said Hu was behind it; so
during the CCP conference Xi had him thrown out, as a punishment. That
is the claim anyway.

Where would we rewind fundamental phy, before it was fucked up beyond
recognition? I thought about this before; Pre-Shelter Island
Conference sounds fine. Take QM (enough for electronics), get rid of
the stuff afterwards, using the measurements obtained past that point
continue from there, with the possib reworking QM as well to fit into
a new framework.
