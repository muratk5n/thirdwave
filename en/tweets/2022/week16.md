Woke has history.. Post 9/11 there was Jack Bauer, James Blonde,
Bourne beating up on 'terrorists'.. After Iraq mishaps, financial
crisis, there was partial return to normality, some backlash, minor
Woke - not too bad. It was after Trump ppl really went batshit, 'oh no
it aint over' kind of realization set it, then we had mega backlash,
mega Woke, overcuck. Recent commentary here have mostly been on this
last phase.

The claim is BW III will be based on a new commodity based Asian
currency - replacing the dollar-based system.

Pozsar: "If we are right, and if this is a “crisis of commodities” – a
2008 of sorts thematically, if not in terms of size or severity – who
will provide the backstop?  We see but only one entity: the PBoC!
Western central banks cannot close the gaping “commodities basis”
because their respective sovereigns are the ones driving the
sanctions. They will have to deal with the inflationary impacts of the
“commodities basis” and try to cool them with rate hikes, but they
will not be able to provide the outside spreads and won’t be able to
provide balance sheet to close “Russia-non-Russia” spreads.  Commodity
traders won’t be able to either. Remember that Glencore rose from the
ashes of Marc Rich + Co, and with Switzerland along with the
sanctions, Swiss-based commodity traders will think twice about
arbitraging the spreads.

But the PBoC [Chinese Central Bank] can…

.. as it banks for a sovereign who can dance to its own tune. To make
things more complicated, China is probably thinking deep and hard
about the value of the inside money claims in its FX reserves, now
that the G7 seized Russia’s...

The Fed and other central banks will be able to provide liquidity
backstops.. .. but those will be Band-Aid solutions. The true problem
here is not liquidity per se. Liquidity is just a manifestation of a
larger problem, which is the Russian-non-Russian commodities basis,
which only China will be able to close"

Pozsar: "[I]f you believe that the West can craft sanctions that
maximize pain for Russia while minimizing financial stability risks
and price stability risks in the West, you could also believe in
unicorns"

By CC=1 he means individual commodity prices are going up and down in
sync.

Pozsar: "Commodity correlations are also at 1, which, to stress, is
never a good thing. But that’s precisely what happens when the West
sanctions the single-largest commodity producer of the world, which
sells virtually everything..

The commodities market is much more financialized and
leveraged today than it was during the 1973 OPEC supply crisis, and
today’s Russian supply crisis is much bigger, much more broad-based,
and much more correlated. It’s scarier"

Did Russkies leave that big fat pile of reserve dough out there so they
could be seized, giving them excuse to demand rouble for gas? Makes
u wonder.

Pozsar: "Bretton Woods II was built on inside money [as in
petrodollar], and its foundations crumbled a week ago when the G7
seized Russia’s FX reserves"

The Finance Twitter, \#fintwit, is abuzz with that Zoltan Pozsar

NATO-style.. Then what was the point of all that 'giving up NATO
membership' talk? This sounds like a non-concession concession. No
wonder UKR-RU discussions are dead.

NATO-style security guarantees at Russia talks"
