‚Äúfollowing the remarkable development of the projects carried out by

My guess on why the gained ground, Russia goes in with the essentials - 
guns, grain, protection detail for the leader (it's key) while US
condemns for violation of this or that. The West (and China) have the
money and some turn their nose at military relations and support but
it clearly makes a difference. Plus with the war in UA grain is more
valuable.

Geek Wire: "Seattle-based First Mode and the Anglo American mining

Anglo American‚Äôs nuGen effort to develop a [H2 based] zero-emission
system for hauling ore. The transaction, which is expected to close
next month, values the newly combined business at around $1.5 billion
and includes a 200 million equity injection from Anglo American...

First Mode is an engineering company that initially focused on
providing expertise for space projects such as NASA‚Äôs Perseverance
rover mission and the Psyche mission to a metal-rich asteroid. But in
recent years, it‚Äôs devoted increasing attention to carbon-reduction
technologies for heavy industry. The company provided the
hydrogen-fueled hybrid power plant for Anglo American‚Äôs nuGen mining

Canadian Greens need a little disrupting. They are copying 2010s Dem

"@intelwire@mastodon.social

The Turing Test poisoned the minds of generations of AI enthusiasts,
because its criteria is producing text that persuades observers it was

The result? Generative AI text products designed to 'appear real'

It *should* be obvious why it's problematic to create a piece of
software that excels at persuasion without concern for accuracy,
honesty or ethics. But apparently it's not"

Fundamental research has seen giants in its past; Gauss could ask a
graduate student to "go formalize some stuff on geometry", and dude
would go off and *invent topology* (this is Riemann fyi). Or Hilbert,
whose mere questions would spur deep research and continue to do so to
this day. Who is the equivalent figure here? Edward Witten?  Guy got
sucked into the quicksand of string theory now is so stuck that when
asked about what else is there promising other than string theory in
an interview he'll flatly respond "there is nothing else" üò∂ -
imagine that, says this despite the field not having produced
anything of significance for the past 40+ years. Grand fail.

---

After WWII US became the center of science; they were supposed to be
the stewards of fundamental research. But at least from physics point
of view they've done a piss poor job of it. The fruitless avenues
scientists are stuck at now remind me how bizarre gismos that are
constantly "invented" there, the same mentality seems to have been
applied to fundamental science. The problem is gismos go away if they
can't find traction, but the bizarre avenues linger until the lost
muckers stuck in them are dead or their funding is cut. Rube Goldberg
approach doesn't work for fundamentals.

Small win IMO; electricity consumption is only 15-20% of all energy

I'd say at this juncture in geo pol, this guy could come in handy for
Russia. How crazy would it be Bout arranges purchasing of stolen
US arms from Ukraine for Russia?

From book *Merchant of Death*, "Bout cultivated close business and
social ties with some of the Third World‚Äôs.. strongmen. He dealt
directly with Charles Taylor in Liberia, Mubuto Sese Seko in Zaire,
Paul Kagame in Rwanda, and rebel leaders Jonas Savimbi in Angola,
Jean-Pierre Bemba in the DRC, and Sam 'Mosquito' Bockarie in Sierra
Leone. Bout armed and hunted with Ahmad Shah Massoud, the resistance
fighter and Northern Alliance leader who became an Afghan hero but who
was also accused of massacring his foes. Bout‚Äôs organization then
nimbly switched sides in Afghanistan, covertly aiding the despotic
Taliban regime, secretly providing the Islamic militants with their
own fleet of cargo planes and flying in weapons and supplies that
aided both the mullahs and their al Qaeda financiers"

the Yugoslav Wars, especially with the Bosnian government forces
during its uprising against the Milosevic government in
Yugoslavia. Hasan Cengic, who was the former Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is
allegedly one of his former contacts"

Forbes: "Why are so many semiconductor chips used in cars?.. For
automobiles, the huge push for improvements in fuel economy after the
1973 oil crisis led to the rapid increase in the use of electronics in
engine controls. While electronic ignitions had started to appear in
the late 1960s, the use of microcontroller chips for engine controls
demonstrated what was possible with a digital approach. Using sensors
to monitor things like temperature, crankshaft position, mass air
flow, throttle position, and concentration of oxygen in the exhaust
gases, automakers were able to dramatically improve the fuel economy
and emissions profiles of their vehicles. The controller chips did
on-the-fly calculations to optimize engine performance, something that
was impossible to do with mechanical sensors and linkages"
