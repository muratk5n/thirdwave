We should not expect people to vote in policies that are beneficial,
they are too policy-stupid for that. It takes leadership to enact change,
if popular (ppl have to see it to believe it) than you reap the benefits
as a leader.

When she first started challenging car dominance, Mayor Anne Hidalgo

But these measures are working, and proving incredibly popular, as she
was comfortably re-elected in 2020"

Forbes: "Why are so many semiconductor chips used in cars?.. For
automobiles, the huge push for improvements in fuel economy after the
1973 oil crisis led to the rapid increase in the use of electronics in
engine controls. While electronic ignitions had started to appear in
the late 1960s, the use of microcontroller chips for engine controls
demonstrated what was possible with a digital approach. Using sensors
to monitor things like temperature, crankshaft position, mass air
flow, throttle position, and concentration of oxygen in the exhaust
gases, automakers were able to dramatically improve the fuel economy
and emissions profiles of their vehicles. The controller chips did
on-the-fly calculations to optimize engine performance, something that
was impossible to do with mechanical sensors and linkages"
