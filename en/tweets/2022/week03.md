# Week 3 

H2 View: "Chile continues to be regarded as the next hotspot for
hydrogen production and with this, Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners
(CIP) has partnered with AustriaEnergy and Oekowind on a 1.7GW
hydrogen project. Situated in Southern Chile’s Magallanes region, the
1.7GW HNH Project will aim to generate green hydrogen using onshore
wind that will be utilised for exports around the world. With an
investment size of $3bn, once the plant is operational green hydrogen
and ammonia will both be exported in large quantities around the world
thanks to the high potential of wind energy in the region"

H2 View: "Proton Motor, Torqeedo to cut maritime emissions with new
hybrid propulsion system.. A new hydrogen hybrid propulsion system
building kit is being developed for the maritime industry to deliver
fuel cell powers between 30kW-120kW, as well as variable hydrogen
storage capacity"

H2 View: "Australia is set to export green hydrogen to the Republic of
Palau, an archipelago of Pacific islands, to supply and implement
hydrogen for fuel cells within vessels in the region."

That would be a 20% reduction in emissions, right away. Slam dunk. Too
bad UK gov is in a funk, things are happening..

H2 Fuel News: "Britain’s gas grid will be ready to deliver a blend of
20% hydrogen to homes across the country next year (2023)"

India has good sunshine capacity as well, I mentioned the neighboring
China more but the difference between them is about 30 Watts
per square meter. See [map](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FCtre5sWEAgFFp9?format=png&name=small)

"[Ambani] said Reliance will pursue the target of bringing down the
cost of making green hydrogen to under USD 2 per kg initially and
ultimately to bring it down to under USD 1 per kg in a decade"

100 GIGAWATTS

$81 BILLION

Al Jazeera: "Fossil-fuel billionaire .. Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance
Industries said it plans to invest 76bn dollars in clean energy
projects, a dramatic increase over its previous commitment of 10bn...

Reliance Industries Ltd.. has signed pacts with the state government
of Gujarat for a total investment of 5.96 trillion rupees ($81
billion), according to an exchange filing Thursday. Of this, about 5
trillion rupees would be used over the next 15 years to build 100
gigawatts of renewable power projects and a green hydrogen network"

Those are not real particles, they are 'pockets' in the fluid that are
followed around. The act of following somewhat resembles following
around a particle, that's where the P comes from... But look
carefully, there is the Navier-Stokes formula lurking in there, which
uses concepts such as pressure, viscosity, heat, concocted at a macro
level, not micro. Without the formula, there is no SPH.

"I saw a method called SPH, smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for
fluids. It says 'particles' right there!"

---

There is a term in FD formulas that says 'if there is a pressure
difference between two regions there will be a force between those
regions, from high to low'. Declerative, broad statement... works
brilliantly. Later when we compute the FD formula we cut its field
into little regions, and either average over them (one method), or
look at the edge points (another method). IOW we work with things we
can measure, and relate them, discretize later.

Nature doesn't give a shit about pressure. It can send off one
trillion particles one way, another trillion another way, the ones
that hit a surface are what we see as pressure, the ones that jiggle
too much are what we see as heat, Nature could not care less. We
cannot compete with Nature at that level... If we tried we'd have to
create a computer as big as Nature. So we need to use our math to
generalize, inventing relations, methods to represent better relations
between attributes we measure.

We use mathematics to compute fluids dynamics (FD), not particles.
True AI research should follow the same path.

Let's clarify 'running'. Our ancestors [did not jog](2010/04/new-evolution-diet-devany.md#jogging),
They either walked, or moved in sprints..

Jogging was popularized so Nike could sell shoes, and clueless ppl cld
claim they were "burning off the fat" created thanks to the producers
of high-sugar diets. 

"Why run? Our ancestors ran, we are built to run, so we are a product
of that natural selection, we still have to do it"

The missile is jointly developed by RU and IN, which is a China
rival.

Inquirer.net: "The government has awarded a $374-million (P19 billion)
contract to India to equip the Philippine Navy with the world’s
fastest supersonic cruise missiles...

It has a maximum range of more than 400 kilometers and a velocity of
Mach 2.8 (about thrice the speed of sound), which is currently the
world’s fastest cruise missile...

Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia have also taken
interest in acquiring BrahMos missiles"

Learning at own pace is beneficial.. Let's expand it, and put it at
the center of ed. At the very least, flip the classroom. Better, flip
the classroom around officially chosen video lectures by DoED.

The Conversation: "A recent report [on remote learning] drawing
together the results of 81 studies of secondary schools from 38
countries [says p]upils have found working at their own pace, and
without the social pressures of the classroom, beneficial"

A lot of the analysis with this theme focus on the security chief. In
authoritarian regimes that guy wld be important right?  Before
protests SC was a stooge of the previous pres, now it's a new guy,
loyal to the new pres. The king is dead, long live the king.
