# Week 3 


Such colorful speeches though.. I'd be impressed if the speechmakers
weren't so full of shit.

---

By its foundation the check on power in US was achieved by having
*seperate* branches balancing eachother, not requiring supermajority
*within* each branch. Appeals to history, customs in this regard have
no basis. SCOTUS works on simple majority. The House passes laws same
way. President is the singular decision maker within his branch (not
even a minority there). The founders could surely arrange some stuff
to require supermajorities within each branch if they thought that was
important. But they didn't.

---

Simple majority should matter. It already does for pres elections for
instance. An handful more votes in a single key state can make one
President.

If it's good for one branch of gov, why not for another?

Vox: "The filibuster has been around, in some version or another, since
the mid-1800s. But it's never been used as constantly as it is today...

<img width="340" src="twimg/FJiQWzxX0AA5N6A.jpg"/>

'We have added a new veto point in American politics,' Gregory Koger,
the author of "Filibustering: A Political History of Obstruction in
the House and Senate," says. 'It used to be the House, the Senate, and
the President, and now it‚Äôs the House, the President, the Senate
majority, and the Senate minority.'"

As Bitcoin's energy footprint grows, Democrats are raising climate
change and grid concerns in their attempts to rein in digital assets..
Scrutiny from lawmakers is triggering lobbying on behalf of crypto
miners who are using an escalating amount of computing and electricity
to extract valuable digital tokens from the blockchain.

'It is time for Congress and federal regulators to step up and address
the serious risks that crypto poses to our economy and our
environment,' @SenWarren said in a statement to Politico"

When you say "it's fake" they get upset bcz it sounds like u r calling
all of the physical exertion involed as fake. That's clearly not the
case. The acts are physical, ppl can get hurt, it just ain't combat,
or even sparring in a competitive way.. It's like shadow boxing, with
two people.

I guess it is, the way figure iceskating, gymnastics is a

Holywood.. Ventura, Dwayne J, Cena...

The Novax incident happened while Australia was (is) trying to open
up. The curt denial probably helped to look tough on virus while still
continuing to open - could have been done partly for that
reason. Novax will be fine.. At that level of fame whether they like

tennis, it's not like it is football. Who cares? My third least
favorite sport (first being golf).

Batteries are too heavy, the train would not move (or catch fire and blow up)

---

As it stands CA railway project is a disaster, will have eaten up over
$100 billion, and as of now it hasn't transported a single passenger.

Buying up land in the path of the project apparently caused some delays,
but overall mismanagement was worse, and the choice of going electric
is a major part of that / its symptom. It points to a pervasive
foolishness when it comes to deciding on green tech. Store green fuel
in one car of the train, enough to propel the whole train for an
entire SF/LA trip. No need for electrified lines, simpler design.

An anti-corrosive substance was not added to the water, the lead in
pipes corroded. They switched back to better source of water in 2015.
It was a perfect storm; dirty water, faulty water treatment, lead
in pipes (which is not uncommon btw).

The main culprit was running out of money, and switching to dirty
water source.

---

Why the water problems back in 2011-15? Flint MI went broke, had lots
of unfunded pension costs. They started cutting services, switching to
water from Flint river was one solution. But the river water is nasty,
ppl developed health problems. The river is actualy is so dirty 
it once [caught fire](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flint-water-crisis-everything-you-need-know).

I mean, seriously, how could this stuff *not* leak, especially at the
end-user level? Pipeline goes into homes, into some crack-ass
mechanism built by god-knows-who, with average design.. Unless it was
built with complete containment in mind, which in regular market
conditions would be hard, and hard to regulate, stuff would invariably
leak.

---

Yep - natgas pipelines leak. The end user (home/business) leaks,
possibly worse.  Fossil in any shape or form should not move from
source to customer, bcz anywhere in that chain it can leak. The only
thing that moves, and used at end-user must be green fuel.

"The study suggests many of these [natgas.. ] leaks come from homes and
businesses.. The team's analyses suggest the five biggest urban areas
studied‚Äîwhich together include about 12% of the nation's
population‚Äîemit about 890,000 tons of methane each year.. The vast
majority of that, at least 750,000 tons, comes from methane leaks from
homes, businesses, and gas distribution infrastructure"

Asia Minor culture has lots of Greek in it, as well as early Celts,
Christianity, then Islam. As the discoverer of organized farming the
region has the longest experience with the structures around it, ie
feudalism. But of course, thanks to varied fresh ingredients good
gastranomy. Migrants arriving into that such as "Turks" were
assimiliated. Their arrival on the whole pretty much meant nothing.

One such fritters is widely prepared known in Asia Minor, called

When u calculate it from principles, the number hits you all of a
sudden with how much energy it indicates. Lot is spent on heating..

I look at the params used, we have leaky homes.. The constant used is
actually high (bad insulation). Bulding materials are shit. Styrofoam
has conductivity of 0.01, one **80th** of concrete brick. Can't we mix
some of that shit into the building materials? Isn't this stuff cheap?
We all used styrofoam cups right? It's light, cheap ass shit.

Don't believe the previous home heating calculation? It used a
precooked constant.. It's good to doubt.. Let's dig in the basics (see

Those are not real particles, they are 'pockets' in the fluid that are
followed around. The act of following somewhat resembles following
around a particle, that's where the P comes from... But look
carefully, there is the Navier-Stokes formula lurking in there, which
uses concepts such as pressure, viscosity, heat, concocted at a macro
level, not micro. Without the formula, there is no SPH.

"I saw a method called SPH, smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for
fluids. It says 'particles' right there!"

---

There is a term in FD formulas that says 'if there is a pressure
difference between two regions there will be a force between those
regions, from high to low'. Declerative, broad statement... works
brilliantly. Later when we compute the FD formula we cut its field
into little regions, and either average over them (one method), or
look at the edge points (another method). IOW we work with things we
can measure, and relate them, discretize later.

Nature doesn't give a shit about pressure. It can send off one
trillion particles one way, another trillion another way, the ones
that hit a surface are what we see as pressure, the ones that jiggle
too much are what we see as heat, Nature could not care less. We
cannot compete with Nature at that level... If we tried we'd have to
create a computer as big as Nature. So we need to use our math to
generalize, inventing relations, methods to represent better relations
between attributes we measure.

We use mathematics to compute fluids dynamics (FD), not particles.
