"Seaborg Technologies.. is working ...  to develop a molten salt
thermal energy storage technology that can store large amounts of
intermittent wind and solar power... 'Normally no chemist in their
right mind would look at anything as corrosive as sodium hydroxide,
Seaborg CEO, Troels SchÃ¶nfeldt, told pv magazine. 'However, in the
development of our reactor, we needed to use sodium hydroxide and were
forced to develop these methods.'..

Sodium hydroxide can be produced at low cost from seawater as a
byproduct from chlorine production. Seaborg said this is six times
cheaper that standard salts used for storage"

"Events, constructions sites and off-grid infrastructure could soon run
on quiet, clean power...The EVERYWH2ERE project, funded by the FCH JU,
has designed light, low-pollution 25kWe and 100kWe generators with
proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells and safe pressurised
hydrogen technology"

Wind did not blow enough.. Never have been a huge fan of wind energy
TBH. 

"Energy prices in Europe have hit records due to a shortage of natural
gas and much lower than expected wind power output"

Blue, green, pink, turquoise.. all good. If in doubt refer to German

Re-ran the code to plot the graphs, the 'tornado graph' is back.  See

At the height of US's logistic support campaign to Britain during
WWII, it was building one cargo ship a week, these so-called Liberty
ships, which were monstreous vessels, quickly put together but they
did the job, carried necessary cargo to Britain. US could do that - it
had the know-how, could creatively speed up a major industrial
process.

Military is a function of a country's underlying economy, and the
economy is a function of its inherent diversity. If a country is
producing nuts and bolts it can put them together for a weapon during
the time of war. If one is producing only bolts, they can't build
shit.. This is why Beckley's power measure is ingenious; it captures
all that through a simple base econ value.

---

It's not entirely correct to judge a country's power by looking at its
military size, its ships, guns. Military power is also a function of
what a country *can build* on demand, when all the chips are
down.. That is deeply related to its industrial, tech capacity, its
economy.

The 'French Trump" is new but if its him against EM, voters will flock
to EM en masse. Say what you will about the FR politics, but they have
a long history of giving the far-right the cockblock.

---

Once I heard that "ala KÃ¤rcher" saying was still a hit in FR politics,
I thought 'they are still regurgitating old stuff from Sarko days over
there?'. That means nothing new is going on on the opposition
side... Macron might just win this thing.

--- 

Not sure the Great Game (from the 19th century), and the Cold War is
enough to explain the UK/RU animosity.. It is over-the-top in many
ways. They fought against Hitler, Napoleon together. And, ahem,
neither side wants a united, strong Europe. Maybe that's what changed

@mourner is V. Agafonkin, creator of the excellent Leaflet mapping
software. The dynamic maps I share on conflicts, equakes etc were
possible thanks to him. LL is open-source, of course.

Crazy seeing messages like this on my feed from someone thinking on
how to get out of Dodge

Some of my friends still consider Vinnytsia as a backup option - as if
far enough away from possible vectors of attacks and at the same time
relatively close to Kyiv"

---

If as an answer to any Ukraine invasion Japan/US take those disputed
Kuril islands back for Japan, I will laugh my ass off. RU navy wld be
busy near Ukraine, the islands are on the other side of the world
basically, Japan always wanted them back, and I'm sure US would love
to put a big fat base there.

Everyone who lived in US knows, mailboxes would get filled with offers
from credit card companies. X% off! Great opportunity! Hurry now!

---

How do credit card companies end up as villains in a movie?
Easy. Perfectly fits with the stagnating "creditor-paradise" described
before. Stagnant wages, no inflation, low rates.. What does that lead
to? It creates an opportunity for a lender to borrow money cheap and
lending it, adding little interest, to the guy who has a low wage and
wants to buy stuff. Debt slavery follows. Unrest.

"2,500 tonne per year low-carbon hydrogen project to be developed in
Canada.. The hydrogen production project will utilise Hazer technology
with FortisBC supplying the natural gas feedstock required in order to
generate the hydrogen"

Going direct to H2 is an excellent pathway

DOE has lit on solar thermochemical water splitting. 

[[-]](https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-thermochemical-water-splitting)

---

I actually joined a DOE Webinar and got that quote from the said expert. ðŸ¤“

---

CSP Expert: "There are several potential ways of generating hydrogen
using CSP. A number of researchers (and a couple of startup companies)
are developing 'solar thermochemical water splitting' which uses a
catalyst (like ceria) at very high temperature to split steam into
hydrogen and oxygen. CSP can also be integrated with high temperature
steam electrolysis (using solid oxide electrolysis cells) to
electrolytically split water at higher efficiencies than typical PEM
electrolyzers"

If Bulgaria spends four times as Sweden spends on heating, this means
their insulation is probably four times worse. Likely true for many
countries in the world. Fix that, cut emissions by 20%. Blend 20% to
existing natgas infra, another 10%.

---

That sounds right

"Buildings account for 36% of EU GHG emissions and 40% of its energy
use: energy efficiency is the most cost-effective method of reducing
their emissions.'.. Innovative SMEs based in the EU are developing a
range of solutions for a more energy-efficient building stock...
[such as a]dvanced low-carbon materials, including high-performance,
unobtrusive insulation techniques"

[[-]](https://www.cleantechforeurope.com/blog-posts/energy-efficiency-policy-proposals-from-the-eu-innovation-community)

---

Nearly 40% of energy use cannot possibly be causing 20% of the
emissions. 

"Heating, cooling is responsible for 20% of GHG emissions"

---

H2 View: "US Senators discuss clean hydrogen at an energy
committee.. US Senator Joe Manchin has discussed the positive impact
clean hydrogen could have on the domestic economy.. 'That is why I
made research, development, and demonstration of these technologies a
central part of the Energy Infrastructure Act..  In that bill, we fund
$9.5bn in research, development, and demonstration of clean hydrogen
and we task the Department of Energy to develop a national strategy
and roadmap to get us to a clean hydrogen economy'"

Doubling nuke plants globally sound far-fetched.. Too many are freaked
out about them; first they'll say 'yeah a GW level nuke plant sounds
great man!'. But you ask if they want it in their backyard, near their
city, they go 'aw man, like, no, how about the neighboring state,
they'll be fine with that.. not here'

---

"EU sanctions would target Russiaâ€™s financial and energy sectors if
Moscow opts to invade Ukraine, EU Commission chief Ursula von der
Leyen said Friday"

---

There were gazillion different ways of saying what he said that in a
debate. You say 'we'll look into the issue', 'I hear some of the
concerns of the parents' blah blah..  invite them in, even include
them somehow.. But then keep teaching the truth.

That's not what this mucker did. He blew a fuse, got all mad, bcz the
real issue is there were two people on that debate connected to the
Carlyle Group, they have nothing else to disagree on, so the Dem
libtard gets triggered. The situation could easily be deflected,
instead TM gave the other side ammunition for culture war. But guess
what - in culture wars Reps have a chance too, so he had his ass
handed to him, proving once again the bizarre Dem moderate centrism
has a long-term electability problem.

Roddenberry was a combat pilot in WWII. As a civilian his plane
crashed in Syria due to engine failure he pulled passangers to safety
from burning fire. He was not a mediocre shitlib boomer watching civil
rights protests on TV getting stoned on a bong while getting a blowjob
and thinking if he was ever on the board of one of those bloodsucking
big corporations one day he'd like to see some 'diversity'
there.. Those sisters in the protest looked hot!

DIS stock fall pre-Feb might have priced in the Q4 fails, which showed
up in the gross profit. Later the perception improved. I'd watch Q1,
if lower GPM, problem.

What is gross profit margin? See Buffett's [open buffet](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffett-financial-statements-income-statement-204642939.html)

---

Revenue growth fine, gross profit margin doesn't look great - DIS
spending too much on non-profitable projects? ðŸ¤” IMO last quarter saw
some triumphs, but also a lot of misses.
