# Week 22 

Oman has sunshine, has great access to the high seas. Perfect industry
for them. Export clean molecules to India, Europe, even Japan.

Party-pooper indeed..

On average reserves increased by 2.4% annually. Latest increase was
0.46%. Besides that new action offshore around Surinam we don't hear
any big news anymore on oil finds. The next Ghawar eludes all. 

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('oil-proved-reserves.csv')
df = df[df.Entity=='World'].set_index('Year')
print ('%',np.round(df['Oil - Proved reserves'].pct_change().mean()*100.0,2))
```

```text
% 2.4
```

---

For 2020 that number was 1,732 gboe, last number represent a modest
increase.

Oil and Gas Journal: "According to [our] annual assessment, the
world’s proved oil reserves total 1,724.5 billion bbl at yearend 2021"

---

What happens to the global price of crude they ask. Who cares? There
would b a US price, an EU price, so on..

---

And here we are discussing bleeping fossil again.. I ask for
CCS-enabled new refineries that can produce clean molecules.

---

Put the two and two together; US looking at refining capacity, has
crude.. Maybe US will simply stop exporting, refine its own oil and
release to the market, reintroducing the export ban? That'll get you
an additional 8 mb/d of oil pretty quick. US could essentially double
its supply of gasoline and halve the price.

---

"In 2021, the United States exported about 8.63 million barrels per day
(b/d) and imported about 8.47 million b/d of petroleum"

---

---

They didn't use their biggest bullet. You are thinking too globalist,
too free market.

Yahoo: "Gas prices have hit record highs but don't expect Biden to
lower them: 'They already used their biggest bullet' [meaning the use
of petroleum reserves]"

---

Not even June yet but already had a 'feels like 39 C' day.

---

This is not some Zen koan or ancient parable. It comes from
mathematical optimization. Optimizing algorithms look for global
minima (or maxima) all the time, and they always try not to get stuck
at "local solutions". 

---

In that case climb down, apply same technique in a different
direction, or try to see two steps ahead if possible; that means have a
two-step plan instead of just one.

---

The one-step vs two-step solution issue is related to small,
incremental wins. Imagine being outside, during a fog, night time, how
to reach the top of a highest near hill? Simple solution - always move
in the uphill direction. Works remarkably well. Even if we lose long
distance vision, improving the current situation builds up in the
long-run, leads to global solution.

But, one can still get stuck on a "local minima". Because we didn't
look ahead, could have climbed the nearest *shorter* hill. The fog clears
we see [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FT3wrouWQAIZqaL?format=png&name=small).

Didn't PM May say "no UK prime minister could ever agree" to an Irish
Sea border? Well there is one now. There is a customs border in the
Irish Sea. That means Brexiters broke the UK to 'deliver Brexit'. They
cut themselves off from the EU which forced them to cut UK into pieces

---

They haven't delivered shit. They swept the hard issues under the
carpet, ending up with worst of both worlds. Those issues are coming
back to bite them in the ass now.

"Current UK government delivered Brexit"

WION: "Sri Lanka buys Russian oil amid economic meltdown"

Done well? Part of their country is *taken*. Over 6 million of the
country's citizens are now refugees. I dont think they are doing well.

"But Ukraine has done well so far"

---

Ukraine is not NATO. NATO-trained yes

---

Not true. NATO would be a formiddable foe against Russia, or anyone
who is dumb enough to take them on. Minus nukes, they'd wipe the floor
with any other power. With nukes involved obviously everyone loses.

"NATO would lose against Russia"

---

Massive electronic-warfare utilization, can have incoming missiles go
haywire. Increased target acquisition capab for later artillery
bombardment.. Can't fight this shit through proxy. Looks bad.

Business Insider: "[2/2022] At the tactical level, Russia's
non-contact warfare doctrine seeks to leverage drone spotters and
electronic warfare to locate enemy forces for destruction at standoff
distances using artillery without exposing tanks and infantry to
direct fire until the opposition is shattered"

"Kidnappings. Outbreaks. Earthquakes. The president assassinated —
this time in his bedroom. How is it possible, many ask, that Haiti
shares an island with the Dominican Republic, with its underground
subway system, health care coverage, public schools, teeming resorts
and impressive stretches of economic growth? Corruption is the usual
explanation..

[I]f Haiti had not been forced to pay its former slave masters, one
team of international scholars recently estimated, the country’s per
capita income in 2018 could have been almost six times as large —
about the same as in its next-door neighbor, the Dominican
Republic.They called the burden imposed on Haiti “perhaps the single
most odious sovereign debt in history.'"

The 'gun problem' cannot be fixed by simply harping about gun control.
'Guns are killing people, fix guns'. Nope. Centrist Dems starting
during the 90s created a culture war around this issue, so one-step
solution will meet intense objection. But if all parties are
ideologically distinct, seperate and secure in their seperation
(dividers not uniters) then 5G issues will find easier agreement. We
know this can happen because it happened before; Reagan was for gun
control. Nixon founded the EPA. Two steps; fix ideology first, gun
agreement later.

---

The world is sufficiently fucked that one-step solution are no more
enough to fix problems. We cant fix the 'green energy problem' by
simply producing 'green electricity'. What will come after? How do you
transmit the energy? 'Well we just extend existing transmission lines'
(suboptimal). So the one step taken to make electricity 'green'
fails. Two-steps was needed not just one. First step; the energy
transmission mechanism changes, becomes gas based. Second step; Green
energy is produced, converted into green gas, using the new
transmission.

Paper: "The performance of high-yield bonds in the US domestic market
mirrors economic performance in the US overall. The yield spread of
high-yield debt over investment grade corporate bonds is more of a
function of the general outlook of the economy than of the health of
the issuing companies themselves, although the latter is obviously
important"

Luna 2.0?

"Luna and UST had a combined market value of almost 60 billion
dollars. Both tokens are now essentially worthless"

---

Oh yes but they didn't have a Bill Clinton, or the centrist Democratic
Party.

"Norway and Finland have similar levels of gun ownership, but far less
gun crime"

---

Sure this whole thing will be solved in a jif by skillful Twitter
put-downs. \#Guns

That won't happen; at worst their military takes over, as they've done
many times before, and they run the country along with its nukes.
Obviously a coup would be bad.

"Pakistan could become a failed state and their nukes could fall in
the hands of extremists"

Politico: "In what sounds like bargaining rather than an unconditional
promise, Russian President Vladimir Putin toyed with the idea of
reopening the Odesa port for grain exports — while again calling for
the lifting of Western sanctions against Russia.

Putin made the remarks during a call Saturday with French President
Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, as concerns
worsened over a looming food crisis due to the inability to export
Ukraine’s grain amid the conflict"
