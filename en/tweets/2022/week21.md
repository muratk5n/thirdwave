H2 View: "Three projects in Chile could double world electrolyser
capacity.. The Government organisation signed three agreements with
GNL Quintera, CAP SA, and Air Liquide, to develop the first
industry-scale green hydrogen production plants in Chile.

The three projects, set to launch in December 2025, are part of six
projects selected by Corfo in December 2021 and are hoped to bring
$1bn in investments and produce 45,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year"

H2 View: "Planned for Oman’s.. Free Zone, [a new] project will
integrate renewable power from solar, wind and storage; production of
hydrogen by electrolysis; production of nitrogen by air separation;
and production of green ammonia...

CEO at Air Products, said, 'We are delighted and honoured to work with
the government of Oman to develop this multibillion-dollar project,
which would be similar to the world-scale green hydrogen project we
are implementing with our partners in NEOM in the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia'"

Need to treat electricity like the plague. Play whack-a-mole with
it. Whenever it is generated, use it and make it go away; quash
it. Run it through an electrolyzer, produce H2, then send the gas over
the pipeline, done. Or convert to ammonia, ship it overseas on large
ships. The longer energy stays in this inefficient form, the worse it
is.

---

The grid 'cannot take it' because it is defective, inferior
technology. Need to transmit molecules (renewable gas), and convert to
electricity as required within cities. The crux of all storage,
transmission, and even end-use needs to be based on molecules. It will
be more [efficient](twimg/EvdKNhvXAAE9Rr2.png)
that way.

"We will bring more renewables online but the grid won't take it, so we
need to update the grid"

H2 Energy [Book](https://www.amazon.com/Hydrogen-Energy-Challenges-Solutions-Cleaner/dp/3030066657),
Zohouri: "The need to reduce CO2 emissions has pushed
towards creation of new 'clean' electricity production paths, such as
photovoltaic or wind power, with hydropower still in use. Although the
number of facilities has exploded mostly because of subsidies, these
facilities now allow for a significant production of renewable
electricity, which can reach more than 50% of total electricity
production, depending on the country and weather conditions.

Electricity production unfortunately has a major drawback:
variability. Mainly depends on meteorological conditions such as wind
and sunshine. Even if forecasts are fairly accurate, production maxima
do not always coincide with consumption, resulting in higher than
demand production; hence, there arises the need to be able to store
this excess electricity for later use, regardless of its form...

What technology should be used to store this excess electricity? The
first solution that comes to mind is batteries. Although some have
relatively large storage capacity, costs and limited lifetime do not
allow for large-scale use. Other solutions exist, but all are limited
in their storage capacity, compared to expected surpluses.

Apart from direct storage of electricity, the other approach is to
convert it into another form to be able to store it. This is where
electrolysis comes into play, i.e. conversion to hydrogen and oxygen,
hence the name power-to-gas"

If Brits did not force the partition in India creating Pakistan,
Afghanistan "problem" would perhaps be easier to handle; India would
have a border with Afghanistan instead of Pakistan, the "porous"
border between PAK and AFG (official look other way while fighters
come and go) could have been less of an issue. The Taliban insurgency
back then benefited hugely from that border, being next to Pakistan,
their intel services. It kept them alive, then one day as we all know
they came back. All thanks to Brits.

It's highly likely H2 boilers, such as the one sold by [Worcester Bosch](https://www.worcester-bosch.co.uk/hydrogen),

30 ships will give 7.7 Gigawatts. Better than one Fukushima.

---

It's possible to create a 'virtual pipeline' through shipping. Ships
constantly go back and forth carrying clean fuel is like a pipeline of
sorts. There is a constant flow within a period of time, like
mentioned before we can compute a Gigawatt measure for that. Compute

On H2 storage \#h2book

[[-]](../../2022/06/the-h2-revolution-alvera.html#storage)

---

Many fossil players are *also* in the H2 game but that is a good
thing. That means the switch to green energy can be faster, with their
input.  Green fuels are great, there is something in it for
everyone. People will get cheap energy, faster, fossil players build
on their gas/liquid handling expertise and keep making money, and
there will be new players who can innovate and expand, hire.

---

The spread of H2 infrastructure needs to be official left
policy. Renewable gas based tech will deliver cheap energy to people
from all walks of life, especially the poor. 

---

Even with limitless energy we'd need green fuels as an energy
carrier.. We cant have a fusion reactor in every car, in every home,
so cars would need a fuel in the tank that was generated by
fusion. From fusion reactor to homes something needs to be piped in,
fast, efficiently.  That something is still H2.

"Nick Hawker might have solved the nuclear fusion equation, leading to
‘unlimited’ clean energy.. There’s a new fusion kid on the block. His
name is Nick Hawker and he carries a very big gun – 22m long. It fires
a projectile at around 7km/s and aims to hit a bullseye only two atoms
wide.

Fusion, of course, is nothing new. The sun has been at it for the last
few billion years and is still going strong, producing vast amounts of
energy..  The fundamental fact [is].. that fusing two hydrogen nuclei
together is hard. They are both positively charged particles and
therefore mutually repulsive...

In contrast, Hawker and his crew have come up with a radically
different approach to pulling off fusion and “getting it done” sooner
too. “Projectile fusion” as practised at First Light, in comparison
with “magnetic confinement fusion” is simpler, cheaper...

Hawker has taken the concept of the pistol shrimp – or the shrimp’s
claw – and converted it into an extremely long pistol, a light gas
gun, with a barrel 22m long, that propels a projectile at around 7km/s
into a cube of fusion fuel, turning it into thermal plasma, which is
so dense that it approaches the density of the core of the sun. When
the projectile hits the outer layer of the cube it produces a shock
wave bubble – just like the shrimp – that then compresses the fusion
fuel and under huge pressures and very high temperature for a
billionth of a second causes ions to fuse and release energy"

All finite-amount crypto is essentially right-wing. Money invariably
has politics associated with it. Crypto proponents think they can
sidestep all that with 'some bits', but that is extremely naive; money
never existed disconnected from a social order.. Gold was *made* into
money through kings (they demanded taxes be paid to them in currency
made from gold, silver, creating demand for those currencies).  Such
metals had no intrinsic value, at least nothing at the level that
primes them to be **the** money.

chance to make loads of money.The Super Bowl was nicknamed the “Crypto

for 30 seconds — featured the industry, several of them starring
boldface names.But after investors watched hundreds of billions of
dollars disappear in a sell-off this month, those famous boosters now
face intensifying criticism that they helped drive vulnerable fans to
invest in crypto without emphasizing the risks. Unlike clothes or
snacks or many other products hawked by celebrities, the crypto market
is volatile and rife with scams"

"Operation Causeway was the U.S. plan to invade Taiwan.. Had it
proceeded, Causeway would have involved 302,000 men of the US Army and
100,000 men of the US Marine Corps, and would have started with the
landings of amphibious landings on the southern coast of [Taiwan]...

However the more the plan was examined the more it was realised that
this would be a very different battleground to the flat plains of
northern France [where another amphibious landing was done, in
Normandy]"

Haha US itself planned the invasion of Taiwan once during WWII but
decided against it, judging the invasion would be too hard

---

Taiwan is not Ukraine. Taiwan has a moat (and more)

---

Ukraine is not Afghanistan. AFG terrain is much more hostile (see the
list of empires getting their ass kicked there)

---

PZ gets some things right; UKR war is taking place on flatlands, and
is mostly an artillery war which favors the Russians.

---

P. Zeihan says there are 9 paths for invading Russia, they always try
to fortify them. But then says RU has to invade Poland. I dont think
that's in the cards. Sure feeling less threat from nearby regions
would matter to them but at what cost.

and blue hydrogen"

---

H2 View: "Australian energy company, Woodside, announced that it has
officially changed its name to Woodside Energy Group Ltd. Previously
Woodside Petroleum Ltd., the name change reflects the company’s recent
sustainable efforts, with significant ventures into green hydrogen"

---

H2 View: "Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) have announced a
proposal to build a dedicated artificial island in the North Sea, for
large-scale green hydrogen production, called ‘Brintø’. Brintø, Danish
for ‘Hydrogen Island’, would provide a significant contribution
towards Denmark’s ambitious hydrogen strategy, with its ability to
supply up to 1 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year once at full
capacity of 10GW..

CIP have suggested that Brintø could be operational by 2030, and could
prove to be a vital step in securing green energy supply for
Europe. The hydrogen produced via Power-to-X will use offshore wind
electricity and will be hoped to be exported to countries such as,
Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium using pipelines"

Hydrogen Alliance, which aims to make the continent a frontrunner in
the green hydrogen development race. The Alliance, formed by Kenya,
South Africa, Namibia, Egypt, Morocco, and Mauritania, intend to
accelerate the transition from fossil fuels, which hopes to open
access to clean and affordable energy supplies"

Their combustion engine is "robust to hydrogen fuel
impurities". Spread of this tech will increase options for transport;
can get fuel through ammonia, LH2, LOHC, as well as pipeline, CH2...

H2 View: "Cummins: We need decarbonisation solutions for the mobility
industry, and hydrogen internal combustion engines are a practical
option. Hydrogen engines are a breakthrough technology essential to
reaching Destination Zero. They are low cost, highly efficient,
perform like diesel in aggressive duty cycles, are robust to hydrogen
fuel impurities, are durable in extreme operating environments, and
are versatile"

---

Clearly their product is based on alkaline fuel-cell tech, which means
it will not need high-purity H2 to function. Their target is customers
who need renewable gas based heating which is potentially huge.

H2 View: "Alkaline Fuel Cell Power achieves first major millstone for
innovative hydrogen technology.. [and] is now believed to be working
to towards commercialising a 4kW micro-combined heat and power
(Micro-CHP) system. The.. system could be a major technology for the
hydrogen industry and is a crucial step in the creation of the
Company’s manufacturing capabilities"

That is genius; put all ingredients in raw, then the whole thing is
cooked as closed, that cooking kill germs inside, and can be sure no
more will enter until the can is opened.

"Canned chicken is pressure cooked right in the can in a process called
retort cooking".
