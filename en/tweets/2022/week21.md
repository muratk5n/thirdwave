HyFlyer.. Great name

H2 Fuel News: "The HyFlyer project is a plan for the decarbonization of medium-range
small passenger aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells.. HyFlyer I is
a demonstration of powertrain technology that will replace
conventional propeller aircraft piston engines.. The HyFlyer II
project is the next phase that will involve the first certifiable
hydrogen electric powertrain"

India also has not developed an extensive natural gas network so far,
which is a blessing in disguise. As it would now be possible to build
gas pipeline grid which will first transport natural gas and will
eventually be used to transport first blue & then green hydrogen"

Not on Mars apparently

"[Perovskite] is also expected to be an abundant mineral in other
terrestrial planets larger than Mars...[it should be] an important
constituent in other terrestrial planets if their rocky mantles
contain substantial volumes above ~23 GPa. Venus, being similar in
size and mass to Earth, should also host Mg-perovskite as its most
abundant mineral phase. The base of Mars’ mantle, on the other hand
[has lower pressure]"

This perovskite is a fantastic material, abundant too

Hydrogen Central: "H2 Clipper, Inc., an aerospace and alternative

"@xtrends

Last week when SPX closed at 4025, I said the market would take a huge
dump this week, SPX cratered over 200 handles this week. The sell off
was somewhat controlled and muted. Dip buyers are still active. There
is absolutely no capitulation. Gonna get a lot uglier than I thought"

That's funny if true

Investors have been buying the dip hoping the Fed will soon
capitulate. Wait until they realize the Fed is serious this time"

All finite-amount crypto is essentially right-wing. Money invariably
has politics associated with it. Crypto proponents think they can
sidestep all that with 'some bits', but that is extremely naive; money
never existed disconnected from a social order.. Gold was *made* into
money through kings (they demanded taxes be paid to them in currency
made from gold, silver, creating demand for those currencies).  Such
metals had no intrinsic value, at least nothing at the level that
primes them to be **the** money.

---

It's not surprising the ultra-rich like the current incarnation of
digital cash, "crypto" - they are based on finite amount money base,
so rich ppl figure if "I put my money in this thing it won't
depreciate it will maintain its value through scarcity".

NYT: "All Those Celebrities Pushing Crypto Are Not So Vocal
Now.. Enthusiasm for crypto from Hollywood celebrities and top
athletes reached a fever pitch over the past year. On social media,
during interviews and even in music videos, they portrayed virtual
currency as a world with its own hip culture and philosophy — one that
was more inclusive than traditional finance and that involved the
chance to make loads of money.The Super Bowl was nicknamed the “Crypto
Bowl” this year because so many ads — which cost as much as $7 million
for 30 seconds — featured the industry, several of them starring
boldface names.But after investors watched hundreds of billions of
dollars disappear in a sell-off this month, those famous boosters now
face intensifying criticism that they helped drive vulnerable fans to
invest in crypto without emphasizing the risks. Unlike clothes or
snacks or many other products hawked by celebrities, the crypto market
is volatile and rife with scams"

"Operation Causeway was the U.S. plan to invade Taiwan.. Had it
proceeded, Causeway would have involved 302,000 men of the US Army and
100,000 men of the US Marine Corps, and would have started with the
landings of amphibious landings on the southern coast of [Taiwan]...

However the more the plan was examined the more it was realised that
this would be a very different battleground to the flat plains of
northern France [where another amphibious landing was done, in
Normandy]"

Haha US itself planned the invasion of Taiwan once during WWII but
decided against it, judging the invasion would be too hard

---

Taiwan is not Ukraine. Taiwan has a moat (and more)

---

Ukraine is not Afghanistan. AFG terrain is much more hostile (see the
list of empires getting their ass kicked there)

---

PZ gets some things right; UKR war is taking place on flatlands, and
is mostly an artillery war which favors the Russians.

---

P. Zeihan says there are 9 paths for invading Russia, they always try
to fortify them. But then says RU has to invade Poland. I dont think
that's in the cards. Sure feeling less threat from nearby regions
would matter to them but at what cost.

H2 Fuel News: "Aramco and [Thai energy company] PTT team up on green
and blue hydrogen"

---

H2 View: "Australian energy company, Woodside, announced that it has
officially changed its name to Woodside Energy Group Ltd. Previously
Woodside Petroleum Ltd., the name change reflects the company’s recent
sustainable efforts, with significant ventures into green hydrogen"

---

H2 View: "Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) have announced a
proposal to build a dedicated artificial island in the North Sea, for
large-scale green hydrogen production, called ‘Brintø’. Brintø, Danish
for ‘Hydrogen Island’, would provide a significant contribution
towards Denmark’s ambitious hydrogen strategy, with its ability to
supply up to 1 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year once at full
capacity of 10GW..

CIP have suggested that Brintø could be operational by 2030, and could
prove to be a vital step in securing green energy supply for
Europe. The hydrogen produced via Power-to-X will use offshore wind
electricity and will be hoped to be exported to countries such as,
Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium using pipelines"

H2 Fuel News: "Alstom, PKN ORLEN sign agreement to introduce hydrogen

H2 View: "Six African countries formerly launched the Africa Green
Hydrogen Alliance, which aims to make the continent a frontrunner in
the green hydrogen development race. The Alliance, formed by Kenya,
South Africa, Namibia, Egypt, Morocco, and Mauritania, intend to
accelerate the transition from fossil fuels, which hopes to open
access to clean and affordable energy supplies"

Their combustion engine is "robust to hydrogen fuel
impurities". Spread of this tech will increase options for transport;
can get fuel through ammonia, LH2, LOHC, as well as pipeline, CH2...

H2 View: "Cummins: We need decarbonisation solutions for the mobility
industry, and hydrogen internal combustion engines are a practical
option. Hydrogen engines are a breakthrough technology essential to
reaching Destination Zero. They are low cost, highly efficient,
perform like diesel in aggressive duty cycles, are robust to hydrogen
fuel impurities, are durable in extreme operating environments, and
are versatile"

---

Clearly their product is based on alkaline fuel-cell tech, which means
it will not need high-purity H2 to function. Their target is customers
who need renewable gas based heating which is potentially huge.

H2 View: "Alkaline Fuel Cell Power achieves first major millstone for
innovative hydrogen technology.. [and] is now believed to be working
to towards commercialising a 4kW micro-combined heat and power
(Micro-CHP) system. The.. system could be a major technology for the
hydrogen industry and is a crucial step in the creation of the
Company’s manufacturing capabilities"

That is genius; put all ingredients in raw, then the whole thing is
cooked as closed, that cooking kill germs inside, and can be sure no
more will enter until the can is opened.
