"@Gargron@mastodon.social

I think it's glorious that there's now a Mastodon server operated by
people who used to work for Twitter (macaw.social). I could have never
imagined it when I started in 2016"

Anyone can start MD server, and join a larger "federation" of servers.

---

Truth Social wanted to commercialize open-source Mastadon...  Why
bother? They could simply start a new server using the existing code,
for conservatives, MAGA or just for Trump and publish on it. People
are starting new nodes left and right these days anyway.

This so-called neuroticism, to the extent it exists, is not there
because said people are different - it occurs due to peer pressure

about *Friends* - it was about bunch of neurotic *New Yorkers*.
