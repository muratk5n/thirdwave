CCS Dat Biatch

It's tough to argue against coal, where it is available it is abundant as fuck

I checked a few, here is [Harrison](https://www.gem.wiki/Harrison_Power_Station#Emissions_Data)

In all these plants? Fort Martin Power Station, Grant Town Power
Plant, Harrison Power Station, John E. Amos Power Plant, Longview

Mountaineer Power Plant, Mount Storm Power Station, Pleasants Power
Station?

West Virginia produces clean energy? Really?

'We produce energy cleaner than anybody in the world,' Senator Joe
Manchin"

---

LCOE (total cost of electricity) will increase with CCS, over 70% in
all cases. Levelised cost of hydrogen is about 50% higher than the
average again for coal + CCS (my prefered scenario).

Gov, policy needs to whip ppl into shape. Unless the cost of those
non-ccs investments increase, the direction of money flow will never
change.

High power prices in the middle of a winter cannot be pleasant, with ppl
freezing their asses off, but maybe reg can offset that price
somehow.

The good news is the tech exists, has a specific price tag, which will
only come down in the future.

Business Insider: "[A]fter more than a decade of keeping interest
rates near zero, the Federal Reserve is all but assured to raise them
multiple times in the coming year to fight inflation. In the world of
finance, these hikes are akin to messing with the Earth's
gravity. Assets that were once attractive ‚Äî companies that used cheap
capital to grow rapidly without making a profit ‚Äî will be
shunned. Some of the investors who ate up those growth stories will go
out of business.

Before the pandemic, the most pressing problem for central banks
around the world was the meandering recovery from the financial
crisis. Growth was sluggish, and inflation was well short of their
target, prompting the Fed and others to keep interest rates
historically low to encourage banks to give out loans and juice the
economy. A side effect of making money easy to borrow was that all
kinds of garbage ideas could get funding and all kinds of garbage
companies could stay in business. Combine that with lax corporate law
enforcement and you have Wall Street without consequences. Investors
were champing at the bit to pile into companies that used fantastical
metrics, like WeWork, and lapped up every utterance from billionaire
CEOs who promised flashy technology but consistently underdelivered,
like, say, Elon Musk.

And that was before millions of bored, homebound Americans jumped into
the market via Robinhood and other trading apps. Armed with their
pandemic-era stimulus checks, they bought crypto, piled into
blank-check companies called SPACs, and joined message boards claiming
that stocks like AMC and GameStop were going "to the moon." Awash with
capital, companies ‚Äî especially in tech ‚Äî saw their valuations leave
Earth's atmosphere and make a home somewhere on Saturn. Short sellers
were culled. Value investors went into hiding.

'We really did hit peak stupid, but peak stupid extended beyond truly,
truly stupid and then we went to
bottom-of-the-ocean-rare-earth-metal-companies stupid,' the value
investor told me.

This is the kind of bubble a financial professional should see forming
‚Äî one where investors lose sight of fundamentals like profitability
and cash flow and embrace a kind of Beanie Baby zeitgeist. In
fairness, on Wall Street you can make a lot of money dancing to the
music at a bubble party. Or you can stand by the snacks and
watch. What you cannot do is pretend that the music will never stop...

Investors Like Cathie Wood ‚Äî perhaps the most starry-eyed of all the
investors betting on moonshot (at best) technology who've caught fire
during this bubble ‚Äî will soon come to find that precious few are
interested in a stock that might quadruple in five years if it can't
show how it will generate the cash to fund its business until
then. Wood's Ark Innovation ETF made a truckload of money for
investors in 2020 until its peak in early February 2021 (yes, during
all the meme-stock insanity). But since then Woods' ETF has cratered,
losing about half its value from its peak to its current trough...

Hiking rates from their decade-plus doldrums is nothing short of
economic regime change. The stock market we had before isn't coming
back. It will take a year or two of the highs getting lower and the
lows never bottoming before it's all over. After that, we'll be living
in another world. In the meantime, get your bathing suits on and
prepare for the washout"

Events might develop for the worse, making the war even more damaging
by then.

"Would it be beneficial for the US admin for a possible Ukrainian deal
(tantamount to admitting defeat) to happen after midterms?"

---

The Independent: "Russia used vacuum bomb during invasion, Ukrainian ambassador claims"

---

You dont have to like the other side's stance, but if they are
consistent, stance fits into a power structure, you can work with
that. After 9/11 US gov types were like 'these jihadi mfkers are such
f-ing weirdos.. I miss the Cold War at least *the other side was
rational*'. Well here are the Russkies, you missed them, they are
back.

Take the deal

Yahoo News: "The Ukrainian side emerged from the talks with little
optimism, and Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no
flexibility thus far... Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron
that Ukraine must disarm, proclaim its neutrality, and recognize
Crimea as Russian, per state media"

H2 Fuel News: "[Agency] develops new submarine hydrogen fuel cell
technology.. The South Korean.. agency has created a new form of
methanol reforming plant. The hydrogen used by the submarine fuel cell
technology would be produced using methanol reforming within the
vessel itself. Fuel cells in submarines use high-purity H2 to boost
the amount of time they can spend underwater"

Al Monitor: "Arabs fear for wheat supplies after Russia invades
Ukraine.. Russia's invasion of Ukraine could mean less bread on the
table in Egypt, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere in the Arab world where
millions already struggle to survive. The region is heavily dependent
on wheat supplies from the two countries which are now at war, and any
shortages of the staple food have potential to bring unrest. If those
supplies are disrupted, 'the Ukraine crisis could trigger renewed
protests and instability'"

RU is self-sufficient, have meat, grain production, and hell, lots and
lots of hydrocarbons.

TPDCAMAU, again

"RU will be isolated"

They probably don't care as much as assumed

"RU will become a pariah"

Biden is not talking to MBS? Why not? Bcz he is bad? Had a journo

talking to him afterwards.

Apparently they will get together to give US price gaugers a stern
talking to üòÇ 

Barron's: "Members of the OPEC+ oil producers' group will meet
Wednesday to discuss loosening the taps -- just days after Russia's
invasion of Ukraine sent crude soaring past $100 a barrel"

---

Politico: "After just one day of the invasion, Russia effectively
controlled nearly a third of the world‚Äôs wheat exports.. Importantly,
while hydrocarbon production can be immediately surged in different
places to meet shifts in requirements, grain production cannot be
surged in the same way, and even a major expansion cannot make up for
the sheer volume of agricultural output that Russia now controls
either directly or indirectly.

Most of the focus has rightly been on the invasion‚Äôs impact on people
in Ukraine‚Äôs most populous cities ‚Äî but in the background, Russia is
completing a hostile takeover of the country‚Äôs grain-rich regions and
their associated transportation infrastructure...

[T]here are only two points of maritime access that Russia needs to
dominate in order to be in control of Ukrainian grain shipments: the
Kerch Strait that connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov, and the
17 ports in and around Odessa.

As of Thursday, Russia had closed access to the Sea of Azov, and, ...
Ukraine has closed all its commercial ports. Ukrainian grain is now
offline"

Near history:

Aug 2010: Once in a century draught in Russia devastated wheat crops
forcing Russia announce a ban on wheat export. 80% of Middle East's
wheat came from Russia.

occurred in Tunisia, following a street vendor's self-immolation

---

WSJ: "Germany to Raise Defense Spending Above 2% of GDP.. The nation
will boost defense spending and create a strategic natural-gas
reserve, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, marking a significant shift in
reaction to Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine"

---

If it is not important why are some trying to expand it? It clearly
*means* something to be in it, as well as outside, and it is
potentially against someone, even in defensive form.

"But NATO is not that important, RU is making a big deal of it"

---

It was the former IMO

Mustache is now saying 'Trump was too buddy-buddy with Putin but we
sent ATWs to Ukraine behind his back, that's why there was no

---

What more could they occupy? Beyond Belarus and Ukraine there is
NATO. Putin wont attack a NATO country - he is not stupid. On the
other side, NATO already expanded as far it could, reaching its
limit. Right? Otherwise UKR's NATO membership would be
discussed.. That clearly did not happen, not after 6/2021 by this
President, not even after 2014 after Ukraine lost pieces of itself to
Russia. On the downside the current limbo status is not enough to
deter, creates further chaos. It is probably a good idea to finalize
it now.

"But will giving in on UKR neutrality entice RU to attack more?"

Yeah - there are still no Nazis in Ukraine... Barking up the wrong tree son

Best part of the speech (see link).

"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Ukraine"

---

Go for neutrality. Finlandization. Or maybe in the future we will call
it "Ukranianization".

"Ukraine agrees to hold talks with Russia at the Belarusian border"

---

Additional manpower, weapons did not help in Syria. Sanctions did not
help for post-Ukraine invasion 2014.

Trying to "shame" RU on moral grounds is useless. Even if they are an
evil force, there is a rational way to deal with them. Their actions
do not reflect on full democracy, as RU cannot claim to be one. But
democratically elected leaders, being responsible for the safety of
their citizens, are on the hook to provide safety. They need to have
the capability to handle this "evil force". You might be
democratically elected, but then have democratically get bit in the
ass by a wild bear, and democratically have your ass handed to you.

---

Its clearly about tanks, as we see now.

Not just tanks, I dont want to nag on the "weapon help" countries are
providing to UKR, even manpower, but it's more than that, you need to
have an integrated warfare capability just like RU (and US).
