H2 Fuel News: "[Agency] develops new submarine hydrogen fuel cell
technology.. The South Korean.. agency has created a new form of
methanol reforming plant. The hydrogen used by the submarine fuel cell
technology would be produced using methanol reforming within the
vessel itself. Fuel cells in submarines use high-purity H2 to boost
the amount of time they can spend underwater"

---

H2 production from waste.. surprisingly cost-effective.

Painting RU as irrational might help to justify a certain military
posture, with US at its center. 

---

"Washington deploying 7,000 troops to Germany as Russia invades
Ukraine"

---

The DE Ramstein US base is so huge it has its own *shopping mall*. The
entire 2003 Iraq War was supported from Ramstein while DE parties left
and right were protesting against the war.

---

CDU Twitter (DE conservatives) is full of 'getting tough' talk. Tough
on who? Last I checked your country was under military occupation by
US of A.

---

TDB: "John Oliver Says George W. Bush Should ‚ÄòShut the Fuck Up‚Äô About
Russia‚Äôs Ukraine Invasion"

---

"@AlanRMacLeod

Fox News talks to Iraq and Afghan War architect Condoleezza
Rice. 'When you invade a sovereign nation, that is a war crime.'

Satire is dead"

---

Hopefully with pilots?.. Watch for those S-400s.. one of the most
capable air-defense systems currently in production.. Can UKR achieve
air superiority with these fighter-jets? NATO itself could not fly
over UKR right now. Drones had some success though

"'Fighter jets' are to be provided to Ukraine"

---

Al Monitor: "Arabs fear for wheat supplies after Russia invades
Ukraine.. Russia's invasion of Ukraine could mean less bread on the
table in Egypt, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere in the Arab world where
millions already struggle to survive. The region is heavily dependent
on wheat supplies from the two countries which are now at war, and any
shortages of the staple food have potential to bring unrest. If those
supplies are disrupted, 'the Ukraine crisis could trigger renewed
protests and instability'"

---

This is my H2 emoji group now ‚ö° üíß ‚öõÔ∏è &#9981; üöô  - electrolysis, on water,
molecule splits, fuel, goes into car. 

---

However North Africa has great sunshine.. proximity to Europe.. "A
pipeline away"  ‚ö° üíß ‚öõÔ∏è &#9981; üöô .

---

India, US, RU look good.. North Africa is in a bad shape.. Must be
climate related (I dont mean climate 'change' - these countries lately
were always in a bad shape most likely).

[C]ountries in the exclusive club of [food] self sufficiency [are]:
Canada, Australia, Russia, India, Argentina, Burma, Thailand, [US and
France].

[[-]](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/is-your-country-food-independent)

---

RU is self-sufficient, have meat, grain production, and hell, lots and
lots of hydrocarbons.

---

TPDCAMAU, again

"RU will be isolated"

---

They probably don't care as much as assumed

"RU will become a pariah"

---

Biden is not talking to MBS? Why not? Bcz he is bad? Had a journo
killed (which is bad)... but Putin flattened Grozny and everyone was still
talking to him afterwards.

---

Apparently they will get together to give US price gaugers a stern
talking to üòÇ 

Barron's: "Members of the OPEC+ oil producers' group will meet
Wednesday to discuss loosening the taps -- just days after Russia's
invasion of Ukraine sent crude soaring past $100 a barrel"

---

Politico: "After just one day of the invasion, Russia effectively
controlled nearly a third of the world‚Äôs wheat exports.. Importantly,
while hydrocarbon production can be immediately surged in different
places to meet shifts in requirements, grain production cannot be
surged in the same way, and even a major expansion cannot make up for
the sheer volume of agricultural output that Russia now controls
either directly or indirectly.

Most of the focus has rightly been on the invasion‚Äôs impact on people
in Ukraine‚Äôs most populous cities ‚Äî but in the background, Russia is
completing a hostile takeover of the country‚Äôs grain-rich regions and
their associated transportation infrastructure...

[T]here are only two points of maritime access that Russia needs to
dominate in order to be in control of Ukrainian grain shipments: the
Kerch Strait that connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov, and the
17 ports in and around Odessa.

As of Thursday, Russia had closed access to the Sea of Azov, and, ...
Ukraine has closed all its commercial ports. Ukrainian grain is now
offline"

Near history:

Aug 2010: Once in a century draught in Russia devastated wheat crops
forcing Russia announce a ban on wheat export. 80% of Middle East's
wheat came from Russia.

Dec 2010: The Arab Spring is sparked by the first protests that
occurred in Tunisia, following a street vendor's self-immolation

WSJ: "Russia Sanctions Over Ukraine Largely Spare Energy Sector, Vital
to Europe"

---

Selected

"EU, US, UK to exclude some Russian banks from SWIFT.. Germany and its
Western allies agreed Saturday to cut 'selected' Russian banks out of
the SWIFT global payment system"

---

WSJ: "Germany to Raise Defense Spending Above 2% of GDP.. The nation
will boost defense spending and create a strategic natural-gas
reserve, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said, marking a significant shift in
reaction to Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine"

---

If it is not important why are some trying to expand it? It clearly
*means* something to be in it, as well as outside, and it is
potentially against someone, even in defensive form.

"But NATO is not that important, RU is making a big deal of it"

---

It was the former IMO

---

Mustache is now saying 'Trump was too buddy-buddy with Putin but we
sent ATWs to Ukraine behind his back, that's why there was no
invasion during his time' üòÜ

---

The fail is so pure, it is now in solid form, it is shit. It's
everywhere.

Retired lieutenant colonel on UKR \#foxnews

---

What more could they occupy? Beyond Belarus and Ukraine there is
NATO. Putin wont attack a NATO country - he is not stupid. On the
other side, NATO already expanded as far it could, reaching its
limit. Right? Otherwise UKR's NATO membership would be
discussed.. That clearly did not happen, not after 6/2021 by this
President, not even after 2014 after Ukraine lost pieces of itself to
Russia. On the downside the current limbo status is not enough to
deter, creates further chaos. It is probably a good idea to finalize
it now.

"But will giving in on UKR neutrality entice RU to attack more?"

---

Yeah - there are still no Nazis in Ukraine... Barking up the wrong tree son

---

Luigi Mengele vs Dr. Oz in a debate? I'd watch that.

Well done little guy

"@SheaSerrano

the baby walked up behind me and said 'daddy check this out' then when
i turned around he was holding the ipad at face level and he tapped
the little buy button on roblox and bought something using my face
scan as the verification lol not even 9am and i‚Äôve already been
scammed"

---

Best part of the speech (see link).

"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Ukraine"

[[-]](https://youtu.be/9_DMcayCtnA?t=1832)

---

Go for neutrality. Finlandization. Or maybe in the future we will call
it "Ukranianization".

"Ukraine agrees to hold talks with Russia at the Belarusian border"

---

Additional manpower, weapons did not help in Syria. Sanctions did not
help for post-Ukraine invasion 2014.

Trying to "shame" RU on moral grounds is useless. Even if they are an
evil force, there is a rational way to deal with them. Their actions
do not reflect on full democracy, as RU cannot claim to be one. But
democratically elected leaders, being responsible for the safety of
their citizens, are on the hook to provide safety. They need to have
the capability to handle this "evil force". You might be
democratically elected, but then have democratically get bit in the
ass by a wild bear, and democratically have your ass handed to you.

---

Its clearly about tanks, as we see now.

Not just tanks, I dont want to nag on the "weapon help" countries are
providing to UKR, even manpower, but it's more than that, you need to
have an integrated warfare capability just like RU (and US).

---

The grand chess master..

"@Kasparov63

[2014] You don't need tanks, you need banks [against Putin]"

Canada is large. But you know who is larger? Russia. Twice the size of
Canada. Any analysis of this country needs to take that into account.

---

Dude in the back just dropped his magazine on the ground, WTF

Thats the guy - "Putin's son"

Reuters: "Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's Chechnya region and
an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on Saturday that
Chechen fighters had been deployed to Ukraine and urged Ukrainians to
overthrow their government"
