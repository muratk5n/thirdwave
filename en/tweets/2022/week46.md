My native homie is NATO, and I guarantee it many in Asia Minor would
not want to go to war with Russia for Ukraine.

Poland is NATO; now stuff can easily get out of hand, in unexpected ways.

Ukraine Border.. The plant lies just a few miles from the border with
Ukraine, and the explosion reported there came on the same day that
Russia launched a widespread missile attack on Ukraine"

US Dem shitlibs looove the war in Ukraine. Finally they have a good
guy against Russia they can identify with. During Syrian war allies on
their side were Al Qaida types, they had freaking beards, names like
Habib, Abdul.. F-ing Mostafa.. Nah.. That didn't work. But European
looking people as good guys, against Russia Russia Russia..?  Now
that's awesome! Hang the Ukranian flag and honk that horn baby!

NYT: "A disagreement has emerged at the highest levels of the United
States government over whether to press Ukraine to seek a diplomatic
end to its war with Russia, with America’s top general urging
negotiations while other advisers to President Biden argue that it is
too soon. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, has made the case in internal meetings that the Ukrainians have
achieved about as much as they could reasonably expect on the
battlefield before winter sets in and so they should try to cement
their gains at the bargaining table"

H2 Fuel News: "Hydrogen fuel planes and power plants will be here
sooner than later.. Electrification isn’t the fastest decarbonization
strategy for aviation and other industries. Hydrogen fuel stock is
rising thanks to funding for regional hydrogen hubs and the expansion
of tax credits like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). More financial
support for H2 development and adoption means that costs can come
down, making it possible to decarbonize transportation industries that
are not easily electrified at a rapid pace, like long-haul trucks,
trains, and planes"

Lerner, 1992, *The Big Bang Never Happened*: "Overwhelming mass of
scientific evidence still contradicts the Big Bang, as this book
endeavors to show. As of this writing.. [BB] remains in just as deep
trouble as ever, with even wider divergence from observation than when
the first edition of this book was completed in late 1990... In the
year and a half since this book was written, the evidence against the
Big Bang has grown stronger, and the COBE results, far from 'proving'
the theory, have not in any way resolved the problems raised by other
discoveries. The key problem.. is that there are objects in the
universe— huge conglomerations of galaxies—that are simply too big to
have formed in the time since the Big Bang, objects whose age is
greater than the age Big Bang cosmologists assign to the universe
itself"

---

Wikipedia: "Eric Lerner.. rejects mainstream Big Bang cosmology, and
instead advances a non-standard plasma cosmology originally proposed
in the 1960s by Hannes Alfvén, the 1970 Nobel Prize recipient in
Physics"

Many dunk on 538 for their past failures but they are making raw data
available through simple URLs, that is great. The site is useful for
me. 

---

That average is the result of an in-house recipe; gives weight to
individual polls according to recency, trustworthiness of the polling
company (why include them if they are not trustworthy), their
bias.. I've seen such approaches in analytics codes, they aren't
usually robust, I wanted to rock'n roll so went for the raw source
instead. Following indiv raw polls for race can expose trends, it can
give an idea.. It worked fine.

"Why did u look at individual polls rather than 538 average before midterms?"

the construction, operation and maintenance of up to 125km of new
pipelines that would distribute hydrogen produced at Stanlow

approximately 10 'Hydrogen Above Ground Installations' (HAGIs)
required along the pipeline route"

Instead of making itself a target in a possible nuclear exchange gov
signaled nuclear neutrality - makes sense for them.

The Guardian: "While Australia was yet to actually join the Treaty on
the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the shift in its voting position
to “abstain” after five years of “no” is seen by campaigners as a sign
of progress given the former Coalition government repeatedly sided
with the United States against it... [The treaty] imposes a blanket
ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use
nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such
activities"

Good/bad acting aside I'm talking about being a fit. An actor is in
some ways a prop on a movie set... Certain base look, and a certain
range of acting makes the actor either a good prop or a bad prop for
certain movie. 19th century period piece needs 19th century props, a
flimsy person role can require a flimsy looking actor. Can Hugh Grant
play Jessup on *A Few Good Men*, or Christopher Walken Neo on *The
Matrix*?
