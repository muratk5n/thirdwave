H2 Central: "Thyssengas is planning an 800-kilometer hydrogen launch
grid in Germany... The transmission system operator Thyssengas
currently operates a 4,400-kilometre-long transmission network, most
of which still transports natural gas. But that is about to change. In
the future, these pipelines will gradually be converted to hydrogen..

With the establishment of a ‚ÄúThyssengas H2 start network‚Äù based on the
existing natural gas network, Thyssengas wants to underline its own
claim to be a pioneer and designer of the energy transition... [Its
CEO] sees the establishment of an H2 network based on existing natural
gas pipelines as a necessary lever and an important signal to
producers, importers and consumers in the Thyssengas grid area...

Thyssengas‚Äô hydrogen grid planning is based on around 45 declarations
of intent (MoUs) that Thyssengas has concluded with potential hydrogen
producers and customers as part of a market survey conducted by FNB
Gas e.V., an association of supra-regional gas transport companies.

Over the 800 kilometres of pipeline identified, these future customers
are to be reliably supplied with hydrogen from 2030 at the
latest. These are lines that are to be successively rededicated for
hydrogen transport or rebuilt in parts"

It makes sense the right does not like teachers; they are the
personification of the dumb shitlib who doesn't know anything but
simply relays knowledge from some kind of 'authority' to the student
but thinks are always right because those authorities happen to be
secular -which of course is no guarantee for anything-.

---

I recommend, teachers, record your own lectures, and flip the
classroom. Next stage, flip the classroom around *someone else's
lecture*, students get quality that way if the teacher is a 'dud'.

---

The lack of focus on the latter part causes focus on the
former..

Alternative ed is not being discussed, so within the confines of
current system teacher quality would be the focus - that is the only
parameter that can be tuned.

On that, [some countries](2021/03/unrivaled-beckley.html#ed) do well,
but most others dont.. I don't think you can do Finland style ed
without being Finland. We need a scalable new approach.

The Mandarin: "Remember when former [Oz] Morrison government minister
Stuart Robert lashed out at 'dud' teachers? In March, the then-acting
education minister said the 'bottom 10%' of teachers 'can‚Äôt read and
write' and blamed them for declining academic results.. We are fixated
on 'teacher quality'.. My analysis found the focus on 'quality' was
far more on teachers than, say, teaching approaches, schools,
schooling, education systems or anything else"

The outer alliance did a good job isolating Europe from its energy
supply. Look anywhere in the map where Europe can get energy, "the
Anglos" created major trouble. Oil-rich Libya? Turned into a
'shitshow' thanks to US. Iran with massive oil/gas reserves is
constantly kept outside the system... Iraq is a clusterfuck, but by
now an old story. Russian relationship? Turned sour thanks to US
meddling in Ukraine. I bet these muckers would mess with Norway if
they could because they are supplying energy to Europe.

Covid: My vote is still is accidential lab leak of engineered virus
(US's fault for allowing research to begin and using an unreliable
lab) or, less likely but still possible, intentional leak triggered by
shadowy US figures. I put intentional China triggered leak below those
two - the aftermath makes it less likely, China had no good vaccines,
and continued lockdowns, workplace interruptions caused major
headaches for them.

FCHEA: "As more and more countries continue to use hydrogen, it‚Äôs
worth revisiting countries.. such as China and India...

China has been an early adopter of hydrogen, and many of its
previous laws and regulations called for the adoption of a hydrogen
economy. Recently however, the Chinese government published the first
official hydrogen plan for the country, designed to set specific
guidelines, and long-term growth targets for the hydrogen industry.
The plan covers a wide range of areas, from manufacturing, and
research capabilities, manufacturing targets, and specific goals for
hydrogen production and consumption... Overall, the central government
seeks to ‚Äúsignificantly improve‚Äù the portion of clean hydrogen in use
across China by 2035. To do so, the government released some nearer
term targets to produce up to 200,000 tons of clean hydrogen.. In
addition to the central government, local governments and the private
sector are also getting involved in the clean hydrogen economy...

India has also begun to recognize clean hydrogen as essential to
decarbonization. The Indian government recently announced a ‚Äúphase
one‚Äù document for clean hydrogen production, and released a set of
policies in early 2022. The policies include allowing clean hydrogen
producers to buy renewable energy at reduced rates, simplifying the
permitting and licensing process to prioritize clean hydrogen, and
allowing the construction of storage containers next to ports designed
for hydrogen. The government has also promised to waive inter-state
transmission charges for 25 years if the project is commissioned
before June 30, 2025. This would significantly reduce the cost of
clean hydrogen, potentially jumpstarting the hydrogen economy in
India. This is all part of the government‚Äôs effort to reduce carbon
emissions to zero by 2070. The government plans to release more
policies to encourage the use of hydrogen production, including
manufacturing zones dedicated to clean hydrogen"

fuelling public transport, heavy-duty vehicles, rail, shipping,
aviation, and other transport modalities. During this time, it is
planned to form a "complete and full nationwide hydrogen value chain"

Davis: "There Is No ‚ÄòMagic Bullet‚Äô That Can Turn The Tide For
Ukraine... In some instances, fighting tenaciously in the face of
considerable enemy superiority can prove to be the difference between
victory and defeat. For example, in the famous Battle of the Bulge,
the U.S. 101st Airborne Division refused to surrender in Bastogne even
after it had been surrounded and cut off by the advancing German
army...

The U.S. commander, however, had good reason to hold on even against
an enemy with overwhelming numbers of artillery and tanks: as soon as
the fog and cloud cover broke, the U.S. commander could expect massive
air support to break the back of the German assaults and aerial
resupply of ammunition and food to Bastogne‚Äôs defenders. More
critically, Gen. George S. Patton‚Äôs 4th Armored Division was also
racing north to relieve the 101st. For the Ukraine defenders, on the
other hand, there is no such help coming...

The much-ballyhooed supply of 'heavy weapons' from the West..  will
not be enough to turn the tide"

Left-wing Catholics aren't much of a Catholic but they cling on to the

like a lastname that is passed down, the thing parents say they are

terms it matters little, grander society will assimilate no running
away from it. Then they go against the teachings. So why bother?

Turkist ideology was always useful for the Anglo. Imagine you have
bunch of deluded people in a strategic peninsula who think they are
not from there, that will encourage "frontier" mentality in that
country. Frontier for what? Frontier for the Anglo. That is why the
outer alliance likes Turkist ideology - also useful for them in the
Caucuses, Central As against Russia (if it can peel off a few
countries here and there based on "common ethnicity" the better)-. So
this is the reason especially post 80s the state narrative emphasized
turning Kemal into a deitic figure, citizens were supposed to worship
Kemal, and he looks Anglo, so through Kemal you worship the Anglo
(your alliance with them).

Now that I think about it the "Grand Ancestor" Kemal looks Anglo

"@LionHirth

As an electricity person, I keep being humbled by the energy-carrying

2021 had 516 billion cubic meters of LNG shipped (the volume is of

equivalent to 10 Nordstream pipelines. Not bad.

Secular liberals pride themselves for not following church teachings,
as they have "advanced beyond that" and are now "enlightened". But
they do follow things -secular media, officials' edicts- and they do
follow quite blindly. Electrification mantra was handed down from such
channels, and these muckers ate that up like there was no tomorrow,
and asked for more. That makes them a herd of sorts, different type
than pre-modern religious, but a herd all the same.

---

Fossil fuel lobby might have allowed electrification to be popular
because the lobby knew fools would go around and around, hit a brick
wall, fail and eventually come back to their arms in desperation,
wanting more fossil fuel. Diabolical yes but still
shortsighted... e-retards did create a buzz which grew to certain
degree. At the same time climate was truly in danger, **and** there
was a viable option which remained unexplored for a while because of
the e-retards.

---

They talk big game on multiple universes, time, multiple dimensions,
math..  But dividing 431 by 70 and multiplying by 60? Nah can't do that.

batteries, and compared to 17 mtonnes (available reserves), it
would make blatanty clear the popular view was shit.

Scientists roam... they roam the media, MSM, alternative, or
otherwise..  Yet most of these people are just trend followers.. They
followed the electrification mantra without thinking about it.

Culture Codes can and are frequently used to influence voters who can
end up voting for stuff that are against their interests. Culture is

"UKIP's triumphal march in England and Wales began in 2004. However,
arguably this 'Cinderella story' would not have materialised without
Dick Morris, who helped UKIP with its slogans, and simplified the
essential message in 2003 ‚Äì this can be considered as the second
turning point.  Morris‚Äô aim was to mobilise the anti-EU -citizens and
UKIP‚Äôs slogan was simplified to 'Say NO'; this phrasing left it to the
individual to contemplate their subjective dissatisfaction towards the
EU without UKIP putting words or arguments into their mouths. The use
of Morris‚Äô service cost UKIP ¬£2.36 million, but the spending enabled
UKIP to rise from sidelines to the mainstream.. As far as word choices
in the official documents are concerned, they are arguably practical,
easily understandable, appealing and easy for 'the man in the street'
