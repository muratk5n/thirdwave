Gasworld: "The UK is set to propel its transition to a more
sustainable and secure energy environment following the introduction
of its landmark Energy Security Bill.. the Bill is considered to be
the most ambitious package of energy measures to go before parliament
in a decade. Containing 26 measures based around the deployment of low
carbon technologies such as carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS),
and hydrogen, in addition to suggesting measures to mitigate rising
energy costs, the Bill will be introduced by Business and Energy
Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng"

Today Sunday July 10, 2022 I saw a TV commercial on ABC during the
This Week with George Stephanopolous show promoting green
\#hydrogen. This is first time ever I have seen such a thing in the
USA and I have been watching very closely. An inflection point in H2
adoption trajectory"

Times of India: "The Adani Group recently made an announcement that it
has partnered with France's TotalEnergies to create a green hydrogen
ecosystem. On the other side, Reliance Industries will also invest Rs
75,000 crore over the next three years to set up a new clean-energy
business...

The government launched the National Hydrogen Energy Mission (NHEM) in
2021-22. This year, the Ministry of Power notified Green Hydrogen
Policy (GHP) and welcomed industry leaders. The policy will help meet
the target of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen production by 2030"

I'm sure "pro-bidness" governor is fine with that

Texas Tribune: "Texans face skyrocketing home energy bills as the
state exports more natural gas than ever. The cost of electricity in
Texas is tightly tied to the price of natural gas, which has more than
doubled since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February"

Left-wing Catholics aren't much of a Catholic but they cling on to the
title, especially if it is part of a minority ethnic position; it's
like a lastname that is passed down, the thing parents say they are
and the thing others call them that "sets them apart". In cultural
terms it matters little, grander society will assimilate no running
away from it. Then they go against the teachings. So why bother?

Turkist ideology was always useful for the Anglo. Imagine you have
bunch of deluded people in a strategic peninsula who think they are
not from there, that will encourage "frontier" mentality in that
country. Frontier for what? Frontier for the Anglo. That is why the
outer alliance likes Turkist ideology - also useful for them in the
Caucuses, Central As against Russia (if it can peel off a few
countries here and there based on "common ethnicity" the better)-. So
this is the reason especially post 80s the state narrative emphasized
turning Kemal into a deitic figure, citizens were supposed to worship
Kemal, and he looks Anglo, so through Kemal you worship the Anglo
(your alliance with them).

---

Now that I think about it the "Grand Ancestor" Kemal looks Anglo

These canals are so tiny; saw Panama Canal on a map, holy thin little
slice that was. Where is that wide effin cahuna of canal?  I'm talking
about the Grand Canyon of Water Canals. Like Boom! MIA

"@DanDePetris

Name a period in U.S. history when human rights were at the center of
U.S. foreign policy. I canâ€™t think of any. A lot of presidents insist
that human rights serve as a foundation. Then they realize that, gosh,
working with autocracies is an unavoidable part of the job"

H2 Fuel News: "Gilbarco Veeder-root Prepares For The Hydrogen
Transport Revolution.. It is making available a suite of compression,
dispensing and software solutions, allowing the creation of a network
of renewable or low-carbon hydrogen refuelling stations around the
world. The company is now at advanced stages of developing new
technologies and creating partnerships to.. offer gaseous hydrogen to
serve an ever-increasing number ofÂ hydrogen fuel-cell powered
vehicles"

The grid even looks like shit. [Seriously](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXSTCWYWAAIHhx1?format=jpg&name=small). 
But a [pipeline](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMA3m-DWUAMDe-D?format=jpg&name=small),
lookit. Straightforward, efficient.

---

H2 pipelines are equally efficient compared to the grid. So there is
no need to remain an 'electricity person'.

"@LionHirth

As an electricity person, I keep being humbled by the energy-carrying
capacity of gas infrastructure. A pipeline (say, Nord Stream 1) can
carry gas worth 540 TWh per year. That's 30x times the energy you can
put through an HVDC line. Thirty"

2021 had 516 billion cubic meters of LNG shipped (the volume is of
what natgas liquid translates into when gasified, not of the liquid
itself). In BOE terms `516*1e9 / (170*1e3*365)` means 8315 kboe / day,
equivalent to 10 Nordstream pipelines. Not bad.

LNG ship traffic per year

Secular liberals pride themselves for not following church teachings,
as they have "advanced beyond that" and are now "enlightened". But
they do follow things -secular media, officials' edicts- and they do
follow quite blindly. Electrification mantra was handed down from such
channels, and these fuckers ate that up like there was no tomorrow,
and asked for more. That makes them a herd of sorts, different type
than pre-modern religious, but a herd all the same.

---

Fossil fuel lobby might have allowed electrification to be popular
because the lobby knew fools would go around and around, hit a brick
wall, fail and eventually come back to their arms in desperation,
wanting more fossil fuel. Diabolical yes but still
shortsighted... e-retards did create a buzz which grew to certain
degree. At the same time climate was truly in danger, **and** there
was a viable option which remained unexplored for a while because of
the e-retards.

---

They talk big game on multiple universes, time, multiple dimensions,
math..  But dividing 431 by 70 and multiplying by 60? Nah can't do that.
That calc would have [given them](../../2022/02/base-energy-numbers.html#lithium)
the amount of lithium required to store one day's worth of energy on
batteries, and compared to 17 mtonnes (available reserves), it
would make blatanty clear the popular view was shit.

---

Scientists roam... they roam the media, MSM, alternative, or
otherwise..  Yet most of these people are just trend followers.. They
followed the electrification mantra without thinking about it.

Suez data

```python
import pandas as pd;df = pd.read_csv('suez.csv',index_col=0)
print (df[['novessel','net(mton)']].tail(3))
```

```text
      novessel  net(mton)
year                     
2019     18880     1207.1
2020     18829     1170.0
2021     20694     1127.0
```

If trend continues ships `5303*4=21212` and net tonnage `313*4=1252`
will beat the previous year's numbers. Busy busy busy..

"Head of the Suez Canal Authority.. said.. that more than 5,303 ships
carrying a combined cargo of 313.3 million tons transited the Suez
Canal during the first quarter of 2022"

The implication is people are fools, are easily led by the nose one
way or another. Want better resuls? Provide better leadership for
them.

Culture Codes can and are frequently used to influence voters who can
end up voting for stuff that are against their interests. Culture is
in emotional brain, stronger in effect than the analytic.  That's how
successful ads work too. An ad that highlights IDENTITY will sell
better in US than an ad which talks about the technical specifications
of a car.

---

Not only did DM help cement the culture war in US to divert attention
from real issues, he achived the same result in the United Kingdom. If
there was a psyop agent that aimed to undermine common people's
interests, it's this guy. In both cases he ended up helping the
well-to-do, the rich oligarchy by creating a smokescreen, so they hid
behind it while others yelled at eachother on bizarre issues and/or
at organizations such as the EU.

Dick Morris [again](2021/10/all-too-human.html#triangulation),
providing services on another hot-button division, playing on cultural
rifts, engaging in dubious voter manipulation.

"UKIP's triumphal march in England and Wales began in 2004. However,
arguably this 'Cinderella story' would not have materialised without
Dick Morris, who helped UKIP with its slogans, and simplified the
essential message in 2003 â€“ this can be considered as the second
turning point.  Morrisâ€™ aim was to mobilise the anti-EU -citizens and
UKIPâ€™s slogan was simplified to 'Say NO'; this phrasing left it to the
individual to contemplate their subjective dissatisfaction towards the
EU without UKIP putting words or arguments into their mouths. The use
of Morrisâ€™ service cost UKIP Â£2.36 million, but the spending enabled
UKIP to rise from sidelines to the mainstream.. As far as word choices
in the official documents are concerned, they are arguably practical,
easily understandable, appealing and easy for 'the man in the street'
to identify with"

The smart US play would have used the Zeitenwende as an opportunity to
hand Europe off to the Europeans. Sending 20k additional US troops to
Europe makes me think thatâ€™s not what weâ€™re going to do
