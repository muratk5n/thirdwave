FCHEA: "As more and more countries continue to use hydrogen, it‚Äôs
worth revisiting countries.. such as China and India...

China has been an early adopter of hydrogen, and many of its
previous laws and regulations called for the adoption of a hydrogen
economy. Recently however, the Chinese government published the first
official hydrogen plan for the country, designed to set specific
guidelines, and long-term growth targets for the hydrogen industry.
The plan covers a wide range of areas, from manufacturing, and
research capabilities, manufacturing targets, and specific goals for
hydrogen production and consumption... Overall, the central government
seeks to ‚Äúsignificantly improve‚Äù the portion of clean hydrogen in use
across China by 2035. To do so, the government released some nearer
term targets to produce up to 200,000 tons of clean hydrogen.. In
addition to the central government, local governments and the private
sector are also getting involved in the clean hydrogen economy...

India has also begun to recognize clean hydrogen as essential to
decarbonization. The Indian government recently announced a ‚Äúphase
one‚Äù document for clean hydrogen production, and released a set of
policies in early 2022. The policies include allowing clean hydrogen
producers to buy renewable energy at reduced rates, simplifying the
permitting and licensing process to prioritize clean hydrogen, and
allowing the construction of storage containers next to ports designed
for hydrogen. The government has also promised to waive inter-state
transmission charges for 25 years if the project is commissioned
before June 30, 2025. This would significantly reduce the cost of
clean hydrogen, potentially jumpstarting the hydrogen economy in
India. This is all part of the government‚Äôs effort to reduce carbon
emissions to zero by 2070. The government plans to release more
policies to encourage the use of hydrogen production, including
manufacturing zones dedicated to clean hydrogen"

ERR News: "Estonia is aiming to create a nationwide Hydrogen Valley to
further develop energy independence and in anticipation of the
European Green Deal.. In the coming six years, green hydrogen
production will be developed in at least six regions in the
country. The hydrogen produced in Estonia will be used for hydrogen
fuelling public transport, heavy-duty vehicles, rail, shipping,
aviation, and other transport modalities. During this time, it is
planned to form a "complete and full nationwide hydrogen value chain"
that will accelerate the energy transition and independence of the
whole country under the motto '"from zero to green", a press release
issued by Tartu City Council said"

H2 Central: "The Korea H2 Business Summit, a hydrogen council
established primarily by major companies such as Hyundai Motor, SK and
POSCO, set up a fund to promote the hydrogen industry.

The fund worth 500 billion won (US$383 million) will be established
via investments from domestic member companies and foreign investors
and is expected to be liquidated after 10 years of operation...

Bahn Sang-woo, a managing director of Mirae Asset Securities, said:
'The fund set the yield rate target at 8 percent, with 70 percent of
the fund used for the establishment of infrastructure and 30 percent
for technology investment'"

Politico: "The question of whether to grant an exception to sanctions
on Russia in order to fix the Nord Stream 1 pipeline saw Canada torn
between the demands of Germany, which remains dependent on Russian
fuel, and Ukraine‚Äôs pleas to cut Russian revenue streams.

deliver turbines to Germany following their maintenance in Montreal,
Natural Resources Minister.. announced'"

Davis: "There Is No ‚ÄòMagic Bullet‚Äô That Can Turn The Tide For
Ukraine... In some instances, fighting tenaciously in the face of
considerable enemy superiority can prove to be the difference between
victory and defeat. For example, in the famous Battle of the Bulge,
the U.S. 101st Airborne Division refused to surrender in Bastogne even
after it had been surrounded and cut off by the advancing German
army...

The U.S. commander, however, had good reason to hold on even against
an enemy with overwhelming numbers of artillery and tanks: as soon as
the fog and cloud cover broke, the U.S. commander could expect massive
air support to break the back of the German assaults and aerial
resupply of ammunition and food to Bastogne‚Äôs defenders. More
critically, Gen. George S. Patton‚Äôs 4th Armored Division was also
racing north to relieve the 101st. For the Ukraine defenders, on the
other hand, there is no such help coming...

The much-ballyhooed supply of 'heavy weapons' from the West..  will
not be enough to turn the tide"

of its landmark Energy Security Bill.. the Bill is considered to be
the most ambitious package of energy measures to go before parliament
in a decade. Containing 26 measures based around the deployment of low
carbon technologies such as carbon capture, usage, and storage (CCUS),
and hydrogen, in addition to suggesting measures to mitigate rising
energy costs, the Bill will be introduced by Business and Energy
Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng"

"@respectmyplanet

Today Sunday July 10, 2022 I saw a TV commercial on ABC during the
This Week with George Stephanopolous show promoting green
\#hydrogen. This is first time ever I have seen such a thing in the
USA and I have been watching very closely. An inflection point in H2
adoption trajectory"

Times of India: "The Adani Group recently made an announcement that it
has partnered with France's TotalEnergies to create a green hydrogen
ecosystem. On the other side, Reliance Industries will also invest Rs
75,000 crore over the next three years to set up a new clean-energy
business...

The government launched the National Hydrogen Energy Mission (NHEM) in
2021-22. This year, the Ministry of Power notified Green Hydrogen
Policy (GHP) and welcomed industry leaders. The policy will help meet
the target of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen production by 2030"

Left-wing Catholics aren't much of a Catholic but they cling on to the
title, especially if it is part of a minority ethnic position; it's
like a lastname that is passed down, the thing parents say they are
and the thing others call them that "sets them apart". In cultural
terms it matters little, grander society will assimilate no running
away from it. Then they go against the teachings. So why bother?

Turkist ideology was always useful for the Anglo. Imagine you have
bunch of deluded people in a strategic peninsula who think they are
not from there, that will encourage "frontier" mentality in that
country. Frontier for what? Frontier for the Anglo. That is why the
outer alliance likes Turkist ideology - also useful for them in the
Caucuses, Central As against Russia (if it can peel off a few
countries here and there based on "common ethnicity" the better)-. So
this is the reason especially post 80s the state narrative emphasized
turning Kemal into a deitic figure, citizens were supposed to worship
Kemal, and he looks Anglo, so through Kemal you worship the Anglo
(your alliance with them).

---

Now that I think about it the "Grand Ancestor" Kemal looks Anglo

The grid even looks like shit. [Seriously](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXSTCWYWAAIHhx1?format=jpg&name=small). 
But a [pipeline](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMA3m-DWUAMDe-D?format=jpg&name=small),
lookit. Straightforward, efficient.

---

H2 pipelines are equally efficient compared to the grid. So there is
no need to remain an 'electricity person'.

"@LionHirth

As an electricity person, I keep being humbled by the energy-carrying
capacity of gas infrastructure. A pipeline (say, Nord Stream 1) can
carry gas worth 540 TWh per year. That's 30x times the energy you can
put through an HVDC line. Thirty"

2021 had 516 billion cubic meters of LNG shipped (the volume is of
what natgas liquid translates into when gasified, not of the liquid
itself). In BOE terms `516*1e9 / (170*1e3*365)` means 8315 kboe / day,
equivalent to 10 Nordstream pipelines. Not bad.

Secular liberals pride themselves for not following church teachings,
as they have "advanced beyond that" and are now "enlightened". But
they do follow things -secular media, officials' edicts- and they do
follow quite blindly. Electrification mantra was handed down from such
channels, and these muckers ate that up like there was no tomorrow,
and asked for more. That makes them a herd of sorts, different type
than pre-modern religious, but a herd all the same.

---

Fossil fuel lobby might have allowed electrification to be popular
because the lobby knew fools would go around and around, hit a brick
wall, fail and eventually come back to their arms in desperation,
wanting more fossil fuel. Diabolical yes but still
shortsighted... e-retards did create a buzz which grew to certain
degree. At the same time climate was truly in danger, **and** there
was a viable option which remained unexplored for a while because of
the e-retards.

---

They talk big game on multiple universes, time, multiple dimensions,
math..  But dividing 431 by 70 and multiplying by 60? Nah can't do that.
That calc would have [given them](../../2022/02/base-energy-numbers.html#lithium)
the amount of lithium required to store one day's worth of energy on
batteries, and compared to 17 mtonnes (available reserves), it
would make blatanty clear the popular view was shit.

---

Scientists roam... they roam the media, MSM, alternative, or
otherwise..  Yet most of these people are just trend followers.. They
followed the electrification mantra without thinking about it.

Suez data

```python
import pandas as pd;df = pd.read_csv('suez.csv',index_col=0)
print (df[['novessel','net(mton)']].tail(3))
```

```text
      novessel  net(mton)
year                     
2019     18880     1207.1
2020     18829     1170.0
2021     20694     1127.0
```

If trend continues ships `5303*4=21212` and net tonnage `313*4=1252`
will beat the previous year's numbers. Busy busy busy..

The implication is people are fools, are easily led by the nose one

them.

Culture Codes can and are frequently used to influence voters who can
end up voting for stuff that are against their interests. Culture is
in emotional brain, stronger in effect than the analytic.  That's how
successful ads work too. An ad that highlights IDENTITY will sell
better in US than an ad which talks about the technical specifications
of a car.

---

Not only did DM help cement the culture war in US to divert attention
from real issues, he achived the same result in the United Kingdom. If
there was a psyop agent that aimed to undermine common people's
interests, it's this guy. In both cases he ended up helping the
well-to-do, the rich oligarchy by creating a smokescreen, so they hid
behind it while others yelled at eachother on bizarre issues and/or
at organizations such as the EU.

Dick Morris [again](2021/10/all-too-human.html#triangulation),
providing services on another hot-button division, playing on cultural
rifts, engaging in dubious voter manipulation.

"UKIP's triumphal march in England and Wales began in 2004. However,
arguably this 'Cinderella story' would not have materialised without
Dick Morris, who helped UKIP with its slogans, and simplified the
essential message in 2003 ‚Äì this can be considered as the second
turning point.  Morris‚Äô aim was to mobilise the anti-EU -citizens and
UKIP‚Äôs slogan was simplified to 'Say NO'; this phrasing left it to the
individual to contemplate their subjective dissatisfaction towards the
EU without UKIP putting words or arguments into their mouths. The use
of Morris‚Äô service cost UKIP ¬£2.36 million, but the spending enabled
UKIP to rise from sidelines to the mainstream.. As far as word choices
in the official documents are concerned, they are arguably practical,
easily understandable, appealing and easy for 'the man in the street'
to identify with"
