# Week 39 

For 2025 it predicts Sunni-Shite war. Not good. It is likely too,
these aren't empty predictions.

It does predict that.. It also says Charles will abdicate and the
younger son will become Kang

Renewable Energy Magaine: "A report out this week from Rethink
Energy.. shows that the bulk of the effort to transport hydrogen
around the world will be split between pipelines and liquid organic
hydrogen carriers (LOHC), often transported in ships..

By 2050 [they] forecast that 735 million tons of green hydrogen will
be produced each year.. The trade routes that have long defined the
global energy map will have to be redrawn.. LOHCs â€“ with reduced
packing costs â€“ come in at between 1.48 and 1.86 USD per kilogram over
distances between 7,000 and 20,000 kilometres"

"Russia Says Production Using HTGR Could Begin In 2030.. Russia is
planning to develop a 'commercially effective' solution for the
production of green hydrogen using a high-temperature gas-cooled
reactor unit.. [VP] Anton Moskvin.. at JSC Rusatom
Overseas.. said.. at the Russian Energy Week conference [he added] a
first such facility could be in place by 2030"

Japan Forward: "[03/2022] The results of international joint testing
have proven the safety of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor
(HTGR)... [which] proved that it would not melt down even in the event
of a total power failure... The [plant]â€™s response was
unfaltering. With only the built-in safety features [..the] reactor
shut down automatically without using control rods, and natural
cooling of the core proceeded.

In 2022, JAEA will begin designing hydrogen production equipment that
will use the near 1,000 degrees Celsius high temperature of the [the
design]. The plan is.. mass production of hydrogen that uses only
iodine, sulfur, and water, and does not emit any carbon dioxide. The
HTGR at the practical use stage would be the ultimate decarbonized
power source as it would produce green hydrogen"

Before the state creation, they asked Otto to give land for Israel -
Otto was bunch of backward Romanesque inbred boneheads but even they
smelled a problem, refused.

Israel of today continues to be a useful tool for the outer alliance,

H2 View: "One key zero-emissions product Cummins revealed at IAA is
its fourth-generation hydrogen fuel cell engine. Designed to meet the
duty-cycle, performance and packaging requirements of medium- and
heavy-duty trucks and buses, the fuel cell technology is available in
135 kW single and 270 kW dual modules"

When they say "smart", "connected", I hear "overly dependent",
"fragile".

"Poland amended laws to speed investment in nuclear energy In September
last year, it was announced that six large pressurized water reactors
with a combined installed capacity of 6-9 GWe could be built by 2040
as part of Poland's plan to reduce its historic heavy reliance on
coal.

S. Korea will raise nuclear power to one third of energy
supply.. France [is looking to] build up to 14 new nuclear reactors by
2050.. China alone expects to invest some $400 billion over the next
15-20 years to build â€“hold on to your seatâ€“ 150 new nuclear reactors.

But what does make Japan a special case is that it had been one of the
most anti-nuclear countries of the last decade.  And at the same time,
also one of the most serious about nuclear research, before Fukushima
of course.  Thanks to this situation, one of the major players in the
Japanese plan is now the so-called High Temperature Engineering Test
Reactor, the HTTR [or HTGR], which Japan wants to be the type of
reactor that will shape the long-term future of nuclear energy in the
country..

In fact, [HTTR] reactor, which is located in Ibaraki Prefecture, has
been undergoing tests for more than two decades. And now it seems that
its time has come..

[We talked about] three main types of hydrogen: gray, blue and green.
Well, the truth is that there is another one, a fourth type of
hydrogen: pink hydrogen. Which is, precisely, the one produced with
nuclear energy..

Japan is one of the countries that is taking the hydrogen issue most
seriously. And as you can now see, their new civil nuclear program has
a lot to do with it. And if weâ€™re talking about hydrogen and Japan, we
are not talking about an idea or a futuristic pipe dream, but a
fact..

Japan's Strategic Energy Plan, approved in October 2021, states that
precisely this type of high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor
will be used to produce hydrogen.  In addition, the Green Growth
Strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, dated June 2021, states
that HTTR reactors will be required to produce emission-free hydrogen
in large quantities and at low cost by 2030. Which, in strategic
infrastructure terms means itâ€™s just around the corner"

"[O]ne of the major players in the Japanese plan is now the so-called
High Temperature Engineering Test Reactor, the HTTR, which Japan wants
to be the type of reactor that will shape the long-term future of
nuclear energy in the country... The main peculiarity of this
helium-cooled reactor is that it does not need water, which means that
it can be located practically anywhere on the planet. Whatâ€™s more, due
to its design, the core cannot go into fusion. So, in theory, it is a
revolution.  In addition, and this is very important, it can operate
at very high temperatures, over 900 degrees. And so [with high heat],
it is able to produce large amounts of hydrogen"
