H2 Central: "Refueling milestone to bring fuel cell hydrogen trucks
closer to reality. Federal researchers hope in July to reach a key
milestone to refuel heavy-duty fuel-cell hydrogen trucks in 10
minutes, paving the way to prototype hardware and protocols for
fueling stations...

Shaun Onorato, project lead at.. [NREL] hydrogen infrastructure
program for heavy trucks, described.. steps being taken at the
U.S. Department of Energy to make this cutting-edge technology evolve
from the drawing board into a reality...

'I kind of equate it to when the automobile first came out, people
were trying to figure out how to fuel cars and with what rates and
components. It‚Äôs really neat to be on that side of things where this
is just completely brand-new territory.'

He has been working with NREL‚Äôs heavy-duty hydrogen fueling station ‚Äî
the world‚Äôs first ‚Äî that was created to be highly configurable to
enable a greater variety of research tests.

'Currently nothing exists in this realm for this type of fueling. NASA
does things like extremely high-mass transfer rates of liquid
hydrogen, but this is completely new territory for the [FC] truck
market,' he noted, adding that hydrogen-fueled trucks in operation are
for light duty and use that type of refueling hardware.

'Some manufacturers use one nozzle or two to fuel the
trucks. Everything is based now on light-duty. This work will enable
the creation of a whole new set of components and protocols,' Onorato
said"

H2 Central: "Researchers at The Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology (HKUST) have developed a new hydrogen fuel cell which is
not only the world‚Äôs most durable to date, but is also more
cost-effective..  [R]esearch team led by Prof.. Minhua.. found a new
formula which not only could cut down the proportion of platinum used
by 80 percent, but also set a record in terms of the cell‚Äôs durability
level"

Not every country can do what Finland does. The world needs a scalable
method that can be copied to many environments at ease. Industrial
production scales one product design to many. Ed is still resisting
such "economies of scale" benefits by insisting in-person delivery of
content.

"But Finland finds good teachers, and in sufficient numbers"

---

Flipping the classroom is efficient, works better than
stand-up-and-deliver style teaching. It can also lessen the burden
on the number of teachers required. 

The Mandarin: "Could more online learning help fix Australia‚Äôs teacher
shortage? One option to free up teacher time and ensure students are
getting the education they need is some learning done online and some
face-to-face"

Poland had made some noises some time ago on that saying Western
Ukraine is 'historically Polish'; code-word for 'we can take it'.  If
RU successfully landlocks Ukraine the remaining parts will have a

Aha. Can Belarus use the opp to move South and take what is left of
Ukraine (its western side)?

NYT: "Now Russian forces and their separatist allies control about 80
to 90 percent of the Donbas, according to Ukrainian officials.To take
complete control of Luhansk, Russia first devoted its full force at
the city of Sievierodonetsk, just across the river from
Lysychansk. After battering that city and eventually seizing control
on June 24, Russian forces set their sights on neighboring
Lysychansk.The twin cities were the last major population centers in
Luhansk Province under Ukrainian control. Now with both in hand,
Russia effectively controls all of the resource-rich region and can
regroup with Donetsk in its cross hairs. Controlling Sievierodonetsk
and Lysychansk means Russia could position its forces to mount
offensives on cities to the southwest, notably Sloviansk, Kramatorsk
and Bakhmut. Kramatorsk is one of the last major cities still under
Ukrainian control in Donetsk. If Kramatorsk falls, Mr. Putin's forces
will in effect control the whole Donbas region"

The friend, Ben.. I was wondering where that actor had gone.. Saw the
guy on *Battleship* (good mov), one X-Men, *John Carter* (WTF?), then
nothing. Not a bad actor.

---

*The Terminal List* - going great so far.. Fine story, good action.

Centrist Democrats caused this whole mess by inflaming culture wars,
then not being able to fight it, were hammered, the current SCOTUS is
the result of that. But it cld be a sign of desperation too, pols
could not find a working political setup at the federal level, so they
resorted to these secondary issues, measures (and were pummeled by
them, making the system look like a joke -the country who fought for
abolishing slavery cannot guarantee basic freedoms to half of its
population-). Cant handle the federal level? Then well, maybe soon
won't have a federal level.

---

One could argue United States became united without proper discussion,
without proper debate, in a modern context. There was the civil war
around slavery, federal/local divide was always an issue, but division
settled.. too soon..? Post WWII the war-state bulldozed over
everything anyway and took over, without much discussion.

Europe is going through that discussion now, how states work together,
while still being distinctly seperate, we see some states join (and
some leave).  Stuff is being worked on... Maybe US needs to go back to
a clean slate, then start over. Be less united, then try again.

---

What to do about the "useless tinkering" approach commonly seen in US?
Maybe the latest SCOTUS stance against the "administrative state",
will have the side effect of US eventually disintegrating. Then there
won't be any experimentation of any kind at gov level, bcz nothing
will get done at that level.

---

I say this about El Salvador's Bukake; his country does not show up in
my drug trafficking map, so tough on drugs stance must be working. He
doesn't know much about economics, but not bad here.

Politico: "After decades of illegally crushing competition at the
expense of consumers and small businesses, .. 'Big Tech'.. are finally
facing their antitrust comeuppance in Washington.. American Innovation
and Choice Online Act (AICO).. would ban Big Tech companies from
unfairly giving their products a boost over competitors. The prospect
of this widely popular bill passing has led Big Tech to engage in one
of the most desperate lobbying sprees in recent history. Big Tech‚Äôs
‚Äúsee-what-sticks‚Äù smear campaign against antitrust has encompassed
everything from false claims about content moderation to urging
consultants to pushing the message.. that AICO 'will harm communities
of color'"

The Atlantic: "In May, the Tribune was acquired by Alden Global
Capital, a secretive hedge fund that has quickly, and with remarkable
ease, become one of the largest newspaper operators in the
country. The new owners did not fly to Chicago to address the staff,
nor did they bother with paeans to the vital civic role of
journalism. Instead, they gutted the place...

The hollowing-out of the Chicago Tribune was noted in the national
press, of course. There were sober op-eds and lamentations on Twitter
and expressions of disappointment by professors of journalism. But
outside the industry, few seemed to notice. Meanwhile, the Tribune‚Äôs
remaining staff, which had been spread thin even before Alden came
along, struggled to perform the newspaper‚Äôs most basic
functions. After a powerful Illinois state legislator resigned amid
bribery allegations, the paper didn‚Äôt have a reporter in Springfield
to follow the resulting scandal. And when Chicago suffered a brutal
summer crime wave, the paper had no one on the night shift to listen
to the police scanner"

Yeah? One for all, all for one type of deal? A Mini Medi-NATO? That is
significant. FR has some strat interest in Eastern Med for sure.

"[9/2021] Under the conditions of the agreement signed by [Greece and
France], France has pledged to provide immediate military assistance
to Greece ‚Äì and vice versa ‚Äì in the event of an attack by a third
country, even if that country is in one of their alliances (such as
Turkey, which is a NATO member)"

BBC: "Russia moves to take control of Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project..
The project, which supplies about 4% of the world's current liquefied
natural gas (LNG) market, is 50% owned and operated by Gazprom..  This
appears to be a deeply political move. The impact is likely to be felt
most keenly in Japan, which has been heavily involved in sanctions
against Russia... Japan.. is heavily reliant on imports of liquid
natural gas. Competition for shipments globally is currently intense -
and the Sakhalin project alone currently meets about 8% of its needs"
