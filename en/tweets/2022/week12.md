H2 Fuel News: "Saudi Arabia to start its Neom green H2 plant
construction this month"

---

H2 View: "UAE, Germany strengthens hydrogen collaboration with several
key strategic partnership agreements.. The UAE has received a boost to
its hydrogen ambitions with ADNOC securing several strategic
partnership agreements with leading German hydrogen companies"

---

H2 View: "Thyssenkrupp Steel partners with STEAG to integrate hydrogen into
‚ÄòEurope‚Äôs largest‚Äô steelmaking site"

---

H2 View: "The University of Sydney‚Äôs (UNSW) SMaRT Centre has found
that coffee could provide a means to produce hydrogen instead of coke
and coal for green steel... Coffee, rubber, and plastic all can be
broken down to generate hydrogen within the process and thus can
substitute coke and coal, two carbon intensive ingredients, to provide
a clean variant of steel"

---

H2 View: "Green hydrogen prize is huge for Middle East if strategic
hub approach is adopted.. Momentum is building to scale up green
hydrogen production in the Middle East..  to support industrial
decarbonisation and create a new export economy..

The UAE‚Äôs Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure chose COP26 in Glasgow
as the launchpad for its Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap. And earlier this
month one of its senior officials said hydrogen will be ‚Äòcrucial to
decarbonise industries, transportation, and the fossil fuel sector.‚Äù..

There is clear evidence across the region of buy-in to hydrogen‚Äôs
potential, epitomised by Saudi Arabia‚Äôs stated aim of becoming a
leading global supplier of hydrogen. Plans are already in motion for a
multi-billion dollar production plant in the country‚Äôs north western
region, with a daily production target of 650 tonnes of green
hydrogen, planned to be on stream by 2026"

H2 View: "The heat waves of today would be laughable compared to those
in a 2050 Earth in which climate change efforts have not been made in
any way"

WSJ: "Hong Kong eases quarantine amid angst over ‚Äòzero COVID‚Äô isolation"

---

At a very coarse level (and that is all they see) people perceived
'potus wanted something not done, it was done'. Simple really. Bada
bing, bada boom. Wanted no bada boom, but there was bada boom.

The Independent: "Former president vows 2024 return to White House"

Outers are feverishly trying to peel off some inners to entice them to
join their side.

"In what has been perceived as a historic move, Australia has
repatriated 29 antiques to India"

---

WION: "EU aims to form a rapid reaction force.. US-led military
alliance NATO has for decades provided the bedrock for European
defence and the war in Ukraine has reinforced the instinct among many
EU members to keep Washington close.. But there has also been a push
led by France for the bloc to bolster its own capacity to act. The new
strategy is designed to strike that balancing act while boosting
defence cooperation between EU states"

---

Daily Mail: "Missile attack on Ukrainian military base launched after
Russian troops hacked into British phones.. As a result, Kremlin
agents were able to confirm the presence of former British servicemen
on the massive base ‚Äî and choose which buildings to hit"

---

The uber-antagonism backfired. Russians are now gunning for your ass,
in a recent UKR attack they specifically chose buildings so they could
smoke out Brits. See above.

---

Remember the July 2021 [event](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/world/europe/russia-uk-destroyer-crimea.html).
It was just bizarre.. 

Kinda like [this move](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOY3EccX0AQuQqa?format=jpg&name=small).

But Putin isn't impressed, guy doesn't f--k around.

---

UK was part of the inners (the EU), but left it due to a stupid choice
(that's what you get when you ask 'people' on policy) and naturally
became part of the 'outer belt'. The recent Johnson
[comment](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60809454) on UKR/Brexit
makes this clear; in the Brexiter mind these two issues are linked,
not in the way BJ expressed obviously, but in a larger sense,
exclusively being in that alliance forced them to be a "good soldier",
extremely pro-Ukraine, antagonistic against RU which was unavoidable
after Brexit.

---

Japan has been the ultimate "money guy" for the group. They picked up
the tab for the entire Iraq war effort (the first one).

---

Japan after giving up on its imperial ambitions became a pacified part
of the 'outers'. They are a recent addition to the Five Eyes network
too actually (I guess now the org is Six Eyes).

---

Wapo: "[After little job-well-done, pat in the back, the inevitable
'but' arrives here] Finally, the Western democracies need to think about
how the war ends. While the ideal outcome would be a complete defeat
for Putin and a humiliating withdrawal of all his forces from Ukraine,
that appears unlikely ‚Äî especially given the nuclear arsenal with
which Russia can in effect blackmail the world.

Here the lesson of the Russo-Finnish War is that a diplomatic
compromise may be necessary.¬†Ukraine may have to provide a guarantee
of neutrality and agree to give up some of the territory that is
already de facto in the hands of Russia: Crimea and the Donbas region
in the east"

---

WSJ: "As global brands shun Russia, Asian firms sit out controversy"

---

Arab News: "‚ÄòWhat I saw, I hope no one will ever see‚Äô says Greek
diplomat returning from Mariupol"

---

ISW: "The Ukrainian General Staff reported for the first time that the
Kremlin is preparing its population for a 'long war' in Ukraine"

H2 Fuel News: "First hydrogen fuel cell car in India is the Toyota
Mirai"

---

H2 generation from NG using steam-methane reforming + CCS is one of
the cheapest methods. Both of those producers should be able to
generate the needed supply. They obviously also have some mad solar
DNI.

gas.. [German Economy Minister] Habeck, before the trip starting on
Saturday, said the goal was to 'establish a hydrogen partnership in

has revealed ambitions to develop and flight test an experimental low
cost, wing-in-ground effect-capable seaplane for long-range, low-cost

---

RU is a weapons exporter would not have urgent need for weapons from
others. This is a mudslinging move to shame China into their corner.

NDTV: "Amid Flack, China's US Envoy Says Beijing Now Not Sending Arms To Russia"

---

RU invades UKR, an outer outpost on its border, the most fervent
denials come from US, UK, Oz. Distance-wise these countries are far,
far away, the feverishness of the protest makes no sense; but from a
larger view it does.

---

France has been active on the high-seas, a seafaring nation, but its
history and strategic needs is too tied to the greater Eurasian
landmass, so it mostly behaves like an inner. That is why FR is never
accepted to "the club", the "Five Eyes"; see the recent AUKUS debacle.
They didn't just kick out France, they reveled in it.

---

It might make sense to look at the broad IR landscape through a inner
vs belter (outer) lens, using terminology of *The Expanse*. China,
Russia, Europe are the "inners", US, Oz, UK the outers. Outers want
the inners to stay where they are, contained. 

---

Interesting to note during WWII when Japan was attacking Soviets, and
China, the US was fine with that. After the northward attack stalled
though, and Japan changed focus to the south, the islands, then US put
sanctions on Japan cutting its oil (which triggered a Japanese gamble
on Pearl Harbor to cripple US while it could take all those resources,
US responded).

But US priority was clear, attack the land-based powers, keep them
locked in their places, that's fine.. If you try to be a naval power
yourself, you are in trouble. When Japan tried that it was nuked,
firebombed into submission.

Devine, *Laptop from Hell*: "Five days after Costello‚Äôs late-night
call, on Wednesday, October 14, 2020, the *New York Post* published
the first of a series of front-page bombshells,.. culled from the
contents of Hunter‚Äôs laptop. The story, headlined 'Biden‚Äôs Secret
Emails,' revealed a bombshell 2015 email indicating that Joe, as vice
president, had met in Washington with a high-ranking representative of
the corrupt Ukrainian energy company that was paying his junkie son a
million dollars a year to sit on its board. Eight months after the
meeting, Joe flew to Kyiv and threatened to withhold $1 billion in US
aid unless the Ukrainian government fired its top prosecutor, Viktor
Shokin, who was pursuing Burisma for corruption at the time. The email
was news, in anyone‚Äôs language.

But soon after the Post‚Äôs story broke online, social media censored
it. Facebook announced it had throttled the story‚Äôs reach. Twitter
locked the Post‚Äôs account for two weeks, then admitted after the
election that it had made a mistake. It was a chilling exercise of raw
political power by an unaccountable Big Tech‚Äîthe term given to the
oligopoly of global corporations that dominate the information
technology industry.

The coordinated censorship of America‚Äôs oldest newspaper, with the
fourth largest circulation in the nation, amounted to election
interference. It was a historic moment that rang alarm bells around
the world and would harden resolve on Capitol Hill to rein in the
power of the social media giants"

---

Even some in the establishment must have seen the current state of
play in UKR is no good, largely US's fault. The Hunter Biden thing
resurfacing might be a message to WH..  The HB expose is key bcz it
has the word 'Ukraine' written all over it.

---

This is good

F24: "Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky made a fresh appeal for
meaningful talks with Moscow on Saturday to end the war as Russia said
its soldiers had entered the centre of the besieged city of Mariupol,
'tightening the noose' around the key port"

---

Various end results for UKR-RU are possible .. One assesment I saw
claimed RU will take everything east of the Dnipro river; i.e. all of
Eastern Ukraine. UKR is close in culture to Russians, but the East is
even more so.. Then maybe RU is feeling out how things develop, doing
a little head fake on the North, but invading strongly from Southeast,
and if no agreement is forthcoming, no substantial concessions in tune
of what they wanted, they'll just take Eastern Ukraine and call it a
day.

Combined geographically w previously acquired regions, the whole block
actually makes sense, there is a geographical boundary between East
and West anyway, a river, and it connects nicely with the 'seperatist'
regions, plus Crimea. RU's needed 'buffer' will get bigger, and the
remaining gov in the West will probably not utter the word NATO ever
again.

---

Today India and Russia need eachother in case of a resurgent China and
China needs Russia against what they view as a overly meddling
West. So I dont think "the Quad", or any other pact can override the
India-Russia relationship.

The Guardian: "Beijing‚Äôs readout of the [Biden-Xi] call did not
suggest any Chinese role in ending the war. It quoted Xi as referring
to a favourite aphorism, 'Let he who tied the bell on the tiger‚Äôs neck

Nato are ultimately to blame"

---

"The U.S. believed that a brief period of non-assertive foreign policy
from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s had become the new norm for
Russia. This period was not the norm but an anomaly. Putin‚Äôs foreign
policy has always been assertive, similar to Russia‚Äôs historic foreign
policy"

Al Jazeera: "This is not the time to brand Vladimir Putin an ‚Äòevil
madman‚Äô. Simplifying the war in Ukraine into a binary of ‚Äògood‚Äô versus
‚Äòevil‚Äô will not save us from another world war...

Whether it‚Äôs describing Saddam Hussein as a 'madman,' Gaddafi as
'insane,' or Putin as a 'megalomaniac,' such caricatures serve broader
political objectives by simplifying any conflict into a clear binary
of 'good' versus 'evil'... The Israeli state often indulges in such
framing to delegitimise Palestinians ‚Äì even questioning their
intelligence, by repeating ad nauseum the trope that they 'never lose
an opportunity to lose an opportunity'...

Such framing is now being tactfully employed to
explain away the Russian invasion of Ukraine ‚Äì a manipulative
discourse construction that facilitates a fog of war"
