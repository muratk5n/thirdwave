Data Analysis with Open Source Tools, Philipp K. Janert

"Big Fad?

The rise of Big Data is a remarkable phenomenon. When this book was
conceived (early 2009), Big Data was certainly on the horizon but was
not necessarily considered mainstream yet. As this book goes to print
(late 2010), it seems that for many people in the tech field, “data”
has become nearly synonymous with “Big Data.” That kind of development
usually indicates a fad. The reality is that, in practice, many data
sets are “small,” and in particular many relevant data sets are
small. (Some of the most important data sets in a commercial setting
are those maintained by the finance department—and since they are kept
in Excel, they must be small.)

Big Data is not necessarily “better.” Applied carelessly, it can be a
huge step backward. The amazing insight of classical statistics is
that you don’t need to examine every single member of a population to
make a definitive statement about the whole: instead you can sample!
It is also true that a carefully selected sample may lead to better
results than a large, messy data set. Big Data makes it easy to forget
the basics"

How Simple Ideas Lead to Scientific Discoveries

Great talk by Adam Savage of MythBusters fame. Key quote: "Whenever I
am having trouble understanding a concept, I go back and research the
people who discovered that concept. I look at the story of how they
came to understand it". This key technique is usually lacking in
education. We need to trace the thought patterns of the creators of
all discoveries which will teach students to think like them. They
might even see where they might have fallen short and continue a line
of research if need be. Right now we simply drop bunch of cooked up
end results on a student's lap and expect them to "know", and "use"
these results, similar to the way we give people finished industrial
products for consumers to just "use" and consume.

"If You’re Busy, You’re Doing Something Wrong

In the early 1990s, a trio of psychologists descended on the
Universität der Künste, a historic arts academy in the heart of West
Berlin. They came to study the violinists [..] We can start by
disproving the assumption that the elite players dedicate more hours
to music. The time diaries revealed that both groups spent, on
average, the same number of hours on music per week (around 50).The
difference was in how they spent this time. The elite players were
spending almost three times more hours than the average players on
deliberate practice — the uncomfortable, methodical work of stretching
your ability [..].

They also studied how the students scheduled their work. The average
players, they discovered, spread their work throughout the day. A
graph included in the paper, which shows the average time spent
working versus the waking hours of the day, is essentially flat.

The elite players, by contrast, consolidated their work into two
well-defined periods. When you plot the average time spent working
versus the hours of the day for these players, there are two prominent
peaks: one in the morning and one in the afternoon [..].

Also consider relaxation. The researchers asked the players to
estimate how much time they dedicated each week to leisure activities
— an important indicator of their subjective feeling of relaxation. By
this metric, the elite players were significantly more relaxed than
the average players, and the best of the best were the most relaxed of
all [..].

This analysis leads to an important conclusion [..] If you’re
chronically stressed and up late working, you’re doing something
wrong. You’re the average players from the Universität der Künste —
not the elite. You’ve built a life around hard to do work, not hard
work"

An Italian IT worker acquintance tells me that he left Italy for
Germany. He worked in his home country as a freelancer for a while
where he was taxed at 50%. He complains after all that tax burden,
what he also sees government services such as health, justice taking a
nose dive. And the dysfunction in government services is exploited by
others which makes things worse: freelancer and client agree on a
price but after the work is finished, the client does not pay,
trusting that taking the matter to court will take years to
resolve. But the suck does not end there; freelancer is forced to
settle for less, while paying taxes on the previously agreed upon
price. What kind of bullshit is this? Getting the agreed upon price in
freelance work is not unheard of (in fact it happens in US too) but
the tax thing is completely idiotic. Acquintance told me he actually
saw the number zero in his bank account after his freelance
experience.

There is a groving dissatisfaction in Italy, the perception is the
current political class (and they are a class) have imploded, and went
fubar. The system screws the very people it needs, the people who
create value at the same time, making exploiters, the parasites rich.

This is a big problem in developing countries. Many schools use
English to teach natural sciences for instance which in the long run
hampers the transmission of the subject matter in depth. Yes, one
advantage of foreign language based teaching is being able to use
English based material immediately in class [1], but this single
advantage is erased by other factors that work to a child's
disadvantage. Plus, the teaching material issue can be fixed easily;
teachers prepare their own lecture material in their own
language. Surely not every teacher might be able to do this, but this
blog's position is already that only top-notch researchers teaching
and their video lectures to be transmitted to millions of children
anyway, so we dont really give a f-k about problems of regular
teachers, or the dysfunctional system that is based on their presence.

Most of the other perceived "advantages" of this system are plain
wrong. FLBT complicates the teaching of subjects and fails to teach
the language itself for regular use. A famous Turkish researcher told
a story: he comes to Harvard after studying under FLBT system for many
years, after he lands, he meets his advisor for the first time who
asks him: "How long did your trip take?" to which our guy answers "I
am fine thank you". There are many stories like this. FLBT students
only learn enough of language to get by, nothing more.

Also, Dr Rigoberta Menchú, Nobel Peace Laureate and UNESCO Goodwill
Ambassador for Culture of Peace, writes: “Many people know what it is
like to struggle in school. Others know what it is like to be forced
to drop out. For many children, this deep frustration and
disappointment is not caused by physical or monetary barriers, but by
the decision to teach in a language which they do not understand"

"Unesco has stressed the significance of the mother tongue for over 50
years. Save the Children's 2009 report for the CfBT education trust,
Language and Education: The Missing Link, hammers home this message
[..] The research evidence on mother tongue-based multilingual
education is unambiguous. English-medium education in postcolonial
contexts that neglects mother tongues and local cultural values is
clearly inappropriate and ineffective"

Ass

In hierarchical, military environments which are also heavily
dominated by men, there is lots of joking around the word "ass". I
guess this is funny because the word is so .. "anti", to that
environment. If someone makes a mistake, he'll say "it will be my
ass", or someone steps out of line another can tell him "I am gonna
have your ass". The word can be used as in ass chewing, ass whopping,
or ass kissing. If there are enemy soldiers overwhelming us, I can say
"the enemy is crawling up my ass". I remembered this while watching a
Stargate Atlantis episode (scifi show), the characters' minds are
scanned by some alien race, then they wake up, and someone goes "we
were mind probed". The soldier character in the show thinks about that
little while, then says "I hope that's the only thing they
probed". This stuff makes me laugh to no end.

Changing Education Paradigms

Interesting video, makes some nice points. Some disagreements, there
is nothing wrong with enlightement ideals, or its view of the mind,
and MBTI type system makes clear not everyone will be interested in
theoretical matters. But I am in 100% in aggreement with the other
points. Industrial mindset is the enemy. I also truly abhor the way
Americans make their children pop pills for simplest ailments.

China's deadly wake-up call

The recent collision of two high-speed trains in China that left at 
least 39 people dead is quickly becoming a symbol for many Chinese of 
all that's wrong with China's government and economy [..] If you want to understand the tensions in the Chinese system of 
government and development that might put a knot in straight-line growth
 projections for China's future, spend a minute studying the way this 
event is rippling across China.

"China the innovator" took a big hit [..] The rejoinder from Japanese
and German makers of high-speed trains was that it looked to them as
if China hadn't achieved higher speeds by innovating but by cutting
corners on safety. That argument looks a lot stronger after the wreck,
when so many pundits are comparing the zero passenger-death record in
the 47-year history of Japan's high-speed Shinkansen system to the
record of China's 4-year-old high-speed rail system.

Economic recovery leaving middle class behind

Chrystia Freeland article

Economics professors Nir Jaimovich of Duke University and Henry Siu of the University of British Columbia take as their starting point one of the most important changes in Western developed societies. That shift is what economists have called the “polarization” of the job market. Maarten Goos and Alan Manning, extending the research to Britain, have more colourfully dubbed it the dual rise of “lousy and lovely” jobs.

Their point is that, thanks to technology, more and more “routine” tasks can be done by machines. The most familiar example is the increasing automation of manufacturing. But machines can now do “routine” white-collar jobs, too – such as work that used to be performed by travel agents and much of the legal “discovery” that was done by relatively well-paid associates with expensive law degrees [..].

Job polarization is happening throughout the Western developed world. It accounts for many of the social and political strains we have experienced over the past three decades, particularly the increasing divide between the people at the top and at the bottom of the economic heap, and the disappearance of those in the middle who were once both the compass and the backbone of our societies.

What’s new about the Jaimovich-Siu work is that they have found that job polarization isn’t a slow, evolutionary process. It happens in short, sharp bursts – economic downturns. The researchers found that in the United States since the mid-1980s, 92 per cent of job loss in middle-skill occupations has happened within 12 months of a recession.

“We think of recessions as temporary, but they lead to these permanent changes,” Prof. Siu told me. “The big puzzle about business cycles is, Why have we had these jobless recoveries over the past three recessions? These jobless recoveries are because you have these middle-skilled jobs that are being wiped off the table.”

German Maker of Robots Gains as Chinese Wages Rise

Kuka, the largest European maker of industrial robots, is creating a regional hub in China to develop sales in a country where rising wages are lifting demand for automated factory gear [..] “China alone bought 15,000 robots last year, and we expect that number to rise to about 20,000 this year,” Mr. Reuter said. The company’s target of an operating margin of 10 percent at the robot unit “is within reach,” after having reached 9 percent in the fourth quarter, he said [..]

Rising wages, a push for quality and demands for faster production are prompting the Chinese manufacturing industry to buy more robots, helping European companies like Kuka and ABB turn lagging businesses into profit centers. Kuka’s robots have become twice as profitable as the company’s larger systems unit; ABB turned its robot unit around in 2010 [..]

“Salary inflation is the driving force behind robot demand in China,” Michel Demare, the ABB chief financial officer, said in February.

Jobs is marked as ISTP by CelebrityTypes.com. Some quotes are shared
here. Jobs does not give much credit to thinking, a typical STP
trait. He was for utility, and NTs, SJs are utilitarian as well, but
it appears he was much more focused on impact, and living in the now
the way an Artisan would be. He is adverserial -- in a way an INTJ
could be as well.. but his seemingly enjoying it as a sport, whereas
an NTJ would have seen it as unneeded annoyance, also can make a case
for his ISTP'ness. In addition for an NT, gathering knowledge is
almost a life quest, and Jobs apparently had no interest in this
regard, at least for pure theoretical / application purposes. He was
about the object, about the now, not about the abstract.

The eye-opener is "$499 first-generation iPad included only about $33
of manufacturing labour" -- another indicator of why Chinese model is
not sustainable. As avid readers of the Third Wave, the Chinese
themselves surely know this, and sooner or later, they too will have
to terms with the necessity of transititioning to a more knowledge
intensive and service related economy.
