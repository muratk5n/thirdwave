# Week 32

I recently listened to an episode of This American Life called “When
Patents Attack!”. Something that surprised me while listening was that
while I think of patents as being mostly for gadgets and the kinds of
products you see on infomercials, patents have become a huge factor in
the software and online industries, to the tune of billions of dollars
[..]

Patents are devolving into something the opposite of its original
intent: a tool for tech-industry shakedowns and costly litigation [..]

[A patent has been awarded for] method for concealing partial baldness
(combover) [..]

Many of [the ..] redundant patents are made in an attempt to
capitalize on fundamental systems and behaviours in technology and
online [Examples:]

"Backing Up Data Online". "Providing a User Interface". "Pop-up
Windows on The Web".

Since Barack Obama entered the White House, the number of long-term
unemployed Americans has doubled from 2.7 million to 5.4
million. During the same time, the price of a gallon of gasoline has
risen from $1.85 to $3.49.

The U.S. government says that the number of Americans “not in the
labor force” rose by 17.9 million between 2000 and 2011.  During the
entire decade of the 1980s, the number of Americans “not in the labor
force” rose by only 1.7 million.

Eight million Americans have “left the labor force” since the
recession supposedly ended.  If those Americans were added back into
the unemployment figures, the unemployment rate would be somewhere up
around 12 percent.

The average duration of unemployment in the United States is nearly
three times as long as it was back in the year 2000.

The unemployment rate in the U.S. has been above 8 percent for 40
months in a row, and 42 percent of all unemployed Americans have been
out of work for at least half a year.

I would argue, again, the behaviour outlined above is also a function of distance.

When we label someone, in our minds and eventually during conversation to someone else we are passing information about that person. That information, in turn, will / can be used to (indirectly, additively) to form a trust network in a society. It will spread. You label in one town, and it might take effect in another town.

But, in the case of US, over vast distances, through few people in a populace, all the nuances of circumstance, mood that might have caused a negative feeling about someone might not carry over to another town. So you make up your mind, early (few people, vast landscape also means you are facing bigger dangers that might be more immediate in nature), so instead of bazillion nuances about someone, if the person is "bad enough" you say "he is an asshole". That will carry over to the next town, my friend. Or the reverse, you can also say someone is a "good man".

Done.

Alex Boldt: "The American friendliness is fragile however and is mixed
with a strange moralistic streak: if somebody does anything considered
morally wrong, the normal sympathy and empathy is immediately and
utterly withdrawn and replaced by heart-felt condemnation"

"It could be said (some) religions try to replicate the hunger-feasting
cycle by their fasting process. Jewish tradition has it, Budhists have
it, and so does Islam. In Islam there is the 30 day fasting period,
but then I see these Muslims sometimes who wake up pre-dawn and stuff
themselves with food, so that the hunger period that follows is
"easier on them". When you read the literature (and history) on this
subject, that does not seem to be part of the religion. Even if you
wake up pre-dawn, the eating is supposed to be light, and that fits
with the hunter-gatherer mode of living. It is interesting how ppl can
exploit loopholes for their own ease of living and claim it is the
tradition, turning something potentially healthy into a dieting
nightmare"

So basically what happened is this: FB has an internal product which
competes with this poor guy's app that uses Facebook Connect (an
authorization mechanism through which you can accept FB users, and use
their friendship data -with their permission-, so you dont have to
maintain user related code or data)

Now, first they call this person in the meeting under false pretenses,
asking for "demo" of his app and so forth..  But what they really
wanted to do was to squeeze him out of the game. He was cornered
because he is using a key component of his (now) competitor.

This is not a put-up-or-shut-up situation either. Facebook attracts
developers by making its platform available to all which helps it to
enlarge its user base, they turn out products that in turn brings more
customers, then more developers, on and on.. But then, it tries get
cute, and offer products that use its own platform. Then all of a
sudden Facebook starts competing with its own solution providers.

I need to be blunt about the situation -- the events outlined above is
monopolistic behaviour and should be investigated under Antitrust
Law. The situation is no different than Microsoft favoring its own
browser on its own OS, screwing Netscape in the process, or working
shoddy deals with OEM's to push others out of the game. It is exactly,
the, same, thing. Facebook needs to draw a clear line between its
platform, and its products which might compete with other products
developed by people outside their company.

Generally speaking: we see again that concentration is bad; as bad in
hi-tech as it was in industrial (old) tech. And as we get deeper into
Third Wave, this form of concentration will start feeling the heat,
just like commercial software development has largely been replaced by
open source now for infrastructural projects -- open source being a
disconnected model and more in line with the zeitgeist. In the long
run a similar faith awaits today's "platforms"; I am guessing
solutions such as Diaspora who aim to let each node on the Net to be
able to "serve" content, data, services, "friendship graph" on top of
being passive users of these services, will carry the day. 

"On June 13, 2012, at 4:30 p.m., I attended a meeting at Facebook HQ
in Menlo Park, California. In addition to myself, the meeting was
attended by  [bunch of VPs] at Facebook.  The execs in the room made
clear that the success of my product [which uses Facebook] would be an
impediment to [Facebook's] ad revenue financial goals, and thus even
offering me the chance to be acquired was a noble and kind move on
their part [because FB has a competing internal product].. As someone
that wants to build quality social software, software that doesn’t
force users to re-create their friends list, or not use oAuth, etc., I
have to endure huge platform risk"
