# Week 16

But the success of [investment firm AHL's] machine learning
experiments in recent years led the company to plough more money into
the field, and it is now the single biggest investment area at AHL
[..]. AHL has been researching machine learning — a field of
artificial intelligence where dynamic algorithms pore over vast data
sets for patterns — for five years, and has been using the technique
in trading for the past three years. The results have been
encouraging, according to executives at the hedge fund.

A machine learning strategy helped one of AHL’s funds swing from a
narrow loss to a narrow gain in August last year, when markets were
convulsed by concerns over China, by autonomously buying and selling
stock at vital junctures in the turmoil. Many traders initially stood
on the sidelines, unable to quantify rapidly-changing data.

“It learnt to buy the dip,” said Nick Granger, co-head of research at
AHL and deputy chief investment officer. “No one taught it to do this,
it learnt how to do this when we showed it a lot of data.

Genuine advances in this field are welcome, but watch out

There was an article in the New York Times a short while ago about a
new hedge fund launched by Mr. Ray Kurzweil, a poineer in the field of
artificial intelligence. (Thanks to my fellow blogger Yaser Anwar who
pointed it out to me.) The stock picking decisions in this fund are
supposed to be made by machines that "... can observe billions of
market transactions to see patterns we could never see". While I am
certainly a believer in algorithmic trading, I have become a skeptic
when it comes to trading based on "aritificial intelligence".

At the risk of over-simplification, we can characterize artificial
intelligence as trying to fit past data points into a function with
many, many parameters. This is the case for some of the favorite tools
of AI: neural networks, decision trees, and genetic algorithms. With
many parameters, we can for sure capture small patterns that no human
can see. But do these patterns persist? Or are they random noises that
will never replay again? Experts in AI assure us that they have many
safeguards against fitting the function to transient noise. And
indeed, such tools have been very effective in consumer marketing and
credit card fraud detection. Apparently, the patterns of consumers and
thefts are quite consistent over time, allowing such AI algorithms to
work even with a large number of parameters. However, from my
experience, these safeguards work far less well in financial markets
prediction, and over-fitting to the noise in historical data remains a
rampant problem. As a matter of fact, I have built financial
predictive models based on many of these AI algorithms in the past
[Chan has a PhD in machine learning]. Every time a carefully
constructed model that seems to work marvels in backtest came up, they
inevitably performed miserably going forward. The main reason for this
seems to be that the amount of statistically independent financial
data is far more limited compared to the billions of independent
consumer and credit transactions available. (You may think that there
is a lot of tick-by-tick financial data to mine, but such data is
serially-correlated and far from independent.)

This is not to say that quantitative models do not work in
prediction. The ones that work for me are usually characterized by
these properties:

• They are based on a sound econometric or rational basis, and not on
  random discovery of patterns;

• They have few or even no parameters that need to be fitted to past
  data;

• They involve linear regression only, and not fitting to some
  esoteric nonlinear functions;

• They are conceptually simple.

Only when a trading model is philosophically constrained in such a
manner do I dare to allow testing on my small, precious amount of
historical data. Apparently, Occam’s razor works not only in science,
but in finance as well.

Yes

Chan is the author of two books on algorithmic / quantitative trading
- so he knows what he is talking about. In another post he mentions of
feeling unease whenever he hears of some neural net based trading
model that'll have gazillion free parameters to fit, an obvious
non-linear approach and prone to overfitting on serially dependent
data. 

There is a lot of beautiful mathematics to use on finance and trading,
but they might not always fall under the data mining / AI approach. If
data mining approaches are used, they need to be handled with care -
with a keen eye for the statistical aspects on how the algorithms
behave on the data at hand. 

Overall though, more quantitative approaches are a welcome innovation
- they bring more rationality to the market, and also more
liquidity. Speculation is a good thing - and it is the kind that we
want, mathematical, on open exchanges, rather than the ones through
over-the-counter, and too-connected-and-big-to-fail sausage makers /
banks.

Question

But ppl in finance are not curing cancer.

Not everyone will work on that kind of research

.. no matter the incentive - not everyone should either. While on this
topic, I must say I am a little frustrated by this constant degrading
of finance, as if it the whole industry is born of an evil
seed. Providing liquidity to grain, metal producers, buyers, sellers
is a good thing. During the dot-com boom there were sites offering
pet-services, or  things like "online-laundry". Are these truly
essential services compared to finance? All this stuff is luxury at
the end of the day, isn't it? So is getting a haircut, watching
sports, sitting at Starbucks for that matter. If we scratch the
surface on all economic activity a little, almost nothing will remain
standing, except basic goods and services.

---

Question

But while these [online laundry, pet upkeep, etc] services are being
developed, they spur innovation in related tech (coding of the
backend, handling of data, prediction for CRM so forth), math, and
management techniques. 

Right

But you can say that about anything. Side-innovation is especially
potent in finance, since it is mostly if not all about information.

Question

There is inequality. Health care is broken. People don't spend.

Give people free money

Knowledge driven 3W economy brings with it more uncertainties,
non-permanent jobs / gigs, life is too dynamic. This is the result -
on the one hand people are forced to fight a cage match to "earn", on
the other hand they are asked to consume what are essentially luxury
services.

No wonder company earnings are in a do-doo.

More innovation will also require a better safety net BTW. So however
we look at it, it all comes to the same thing.

Washington Post

There’s little doubt that what has happened to America’s middle class
has helped to create the climate that has fueled Trump’s
[i.e. fascism's] sudden rise [..] For most families, the two
recessions have wiped out previous gains and widened the wealth and
income gap between the wealthiest and all others. “The losses were so
large that only upper-income families realized notable gains in wealth
over the span of 30 years from 1983 to 2013,” according to the Pew
study.

And there is that

Question

Why not give people services?

Too old school

.. because the needs are too varied (see the answer above), and now we
know about them (due to freer flow of information).

If my memory serves correctly, the first exampe of a "social" service
took place a few centruries ago, the state delivered a bottle of milk
at the doorstep of each home. A seemingly nice thing to do - but it
also demonstrated the second-wave industrial age type of
thinking. Nearly half the people in the world have an allergy for milk
- they can't digest the shit. But 2W at the time was producing many
such one-size-fits-all products, it saw the society that way, it saw
life that way. The state simply took that milk that was being produced
en masse, and gave it to people, en masse. Now we know this cannot
work. It's better to give people money so some buy milk, but others a
haircut, some healthcare, some bread, ..  whatever.

Question

What will government do then?

Inspect food, watch borders, smart regulation, fund research

There have been extinction level events triggered by asteroid hits on
the Earth, but it is also known Jupiter with its massive size
protected Earth before, pulling asteroids to itself. Are these views
contradictory?

No

With the Planet 9 explanation, it all makes sense. Jupiter is massive
(in fact some jokingly refer to our solar system as "Jupiter and some
debris"), it saved us before, but P9, being a planet itself, can enter
deep into the solar system, knocking stuff in the direction of
Earth. Jupiter would not be able to run interference against those.

Some more info on the subject: about the periodicity and measurement
of extinction events, paper. My notebook that looks at frequencies of
extinction events [geek] using the Lomb-Scargle method that computes
statistical significance of peaks, rather than direct Fourier Analysis
[/geek]. I reverse-engineered the graph here  with image processing to
get its raw data (who da man!) and compute the periods of extinction
events. The result is this, and periods in this. There is one period
of 25 million years, and one for around 70 - dinosaurs were wiped out
66 million years ago during one of these I assume.
