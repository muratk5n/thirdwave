Republican Leadership

Obama should not appoint the Scalia replacement.

That is ludicrous

For his third appointment, one could expect Bam, maybe, to be more
watchful of the balance of the court as Reagan was for his (he
appointed Justice Kennedy who became a swing vote in today's court),
but I don't think Republican leadership can demand another
ultra-convervative paisan Roman-Catholic from New Jersey. Effin Pope
himself would be okay - not another Scalia.

Trump Employees in Chicago

Ha ha ha

His employees have the right idea...

I guess I am not the only one who took a Trump in the Trump
Tower. Mine was in NY though - more valuable.

Comment

Why are there so many anti-establishment candidates [..]

Anti what? 

This word is sometimes used to describe Bernie Sanders for example -
but they forget the man has been in Congress for decades, and was a
mayor before that. So Bernie is also "the establishment", but he is
from a different part of the establishment that won some of the recent
elections. That's all.

Broadly speaking, I don't think the public will benefit from simply
electing an outsider to work inside the existing system - like The
Trump. Either the system changes wholesale, becomes something else
obviating this incessant need for saviors, heroes who over-promise and
under-deliver, or, incremental improvements are made in the right
direction by experienced operators who know the system
inside-out. Hillary could probably do that, Bernie as well (my #2
choice). On the Republican side it could be Rubio; he seems to be the
least insane among the others.
