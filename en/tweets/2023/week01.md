"A fundamental breakthrough in chemistry promises to unlock ammonia as
a clean fuel, and it could help decarbonize the entire chemical
industry in the process. Rice University researchers have created a
small, LED-powered device that converts ammonia to hydrogen on the
fly. It uses a light-driven catalyst that's as efficient as expensive
thermal catalysts that need thousand-degree temperatures to operate,
and it's made from cheap, abundant copper and iron"

Maersk is mostly responsible of course.. they needed armed security,
they were likely trying to cut costs.

"Approximately half of the crewmembers..  are claiming that the
shipping company, Maersk Lines Limited, willfully allowed the Maersk
Alabama to sail directly into pirate-infested waters despite receiving
multiple warnings to avoid the area. And the lawsuit further claims
that the Alabama didn‚Äôt have adequate anti-pirate security measures. "

This "AI" is truly powerful

"@ct_bergstrom@fediscience.org

I've figured out what pisses me off so much about Facebook's Galactica
demo. It's not because people can use to to write bad essays for their
homework. There are plenty of large language models that can do
that. It's because Facebook is presenting it as something that it most
definitely is not. Facebook is selling it as a knowledge engine, a
'new interface to access and manipulate what we know about the
universe'. Actually it's just a random bullshit generator"

Pixelfed is a photo sharing platform which also implements the
Mastodon protocol ActivityPub, so it's a federated Instagram
competitor just like Mastodon is a federated, distributed soc media
competitor. Maybe ActivityPub will kill more than one bird (!) with
one stone.

‚ÄòGreen Methane‚Äô is not a good idea - it will not spur the consumer
side to switch to clean fuels faster, the carbon budgeting will be
tricky. It will create more cases of Volkswagen-level cheating.

This is Eric Lerner's fusion company; they were researching dense
plasma fusion for propulsion for NASA, until 2001 funding cuts.
His is an alternative approach to fusion.

WWII JP battleship Yamato was a beast; had the biggest guns. But docu
suggests its anti aircraft guns were not good, so it fell prey to
bomber planes lifting off from nearby US carrier - it sank.

The DU research shows the benefits of betting on efficient, simple,
strong base structure - H2 as medium allows further innovations
easily. 

---

The Deakin University research mentioned [previously](../../2022/02/h2-boron-nitrade.html)
accomplishes two things; one is to seperate crude oil gases, the other
is to capture and store H2 with boron nitrade powder. Prof Ying Chen
says the storage part will work on its own, nanopowder captures H2 and keeps it,
later heating it in vacuum releases the gas. Says they have a patent for
their process and already pursuing industrial applications for it. üëç
Whoever he is talking to (he didn't say) I'd find out and invest. Storage
is cheap, in ambient conditions, release of H2 is straightforward.

They did a war-game recently on China-Taiwan conflict, if US were
involved most effective US asset was long-range bomber with cruise
missiles; the bombers can be based outside of CH missile range, but
still strike at the attacking CH forces.
