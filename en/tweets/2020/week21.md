Yes. It's rare but happens. Some people are wired so differently they

simple, buy a plane ticket and leave (he was born French and could not
live there).

Being aware of them will help. Another way is through advanced levels
of certain types of meditation, the hard-core kind, bcz they
ultimately lead to "the death of the socially learned self". You cld
burn a fuse tho, watch out. Krishna almost died. Krishnamurti did
okay, but he had many others helping him. Some high level teachers

Conversely one could say countries with less democracies will be worse
at war. Because they know they can hide, linger in a place, a region,
they would not mobilize to end the fight in the first place. If your
press sucks, you dont fear backlash through it, you fight like a

Yes. If reincarnation is taken as 'entering the game over and over

we play a sufficiently advanced bot? Sure, why not? People even play
hamster, rabbit, fish in games!

Then there is the answer for the conciousness question; can a robot be

Goldcuck still doesn't understand -- the unlinking of gold and dollar
during Nixon admin was inevitable.

Gold or any other finite amount currency cannot be world currency. 

We need [bancor](../../2019/06/bancor.md).
Keynes was a smart guy. 

Gao, Japan's Econ Dilemma: "After World War II, advanced
industrialized countries, under the leadership of the United States,
established the Bretton Woods system and the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (GATT) system to promote social protection and to
sustain the expansion of trade and production. This international
economic order, however, contained the Triffin dilemma: On the one
hand, the Bretton Woods system and the GATT system provided the ally
countries of the United States with great opportunities to export
their products ‚Äì sustained by the undervalued currencies relative to
the dollar ‚Äì and to increase their trade surplus with the United
States.

On the other hand, the United States, as the key currency country
responsible for sustaining confidence in the dollar, could not take
any action to adjust trade deficits through the exchange rate. The
United States enjoyed the benefits of the dollar as reserve,
transaction, and intervention currency, thereby extending its economic
and political privileges and freeing itself from concern about its
balance of payments in the conduct of its foreign policy or the
management of its domestic economy; but any devaluation of the dollar
to improve American competitiveness would immediately have been wiped
out by parallel devaluation of other currencies. Sooner or later,
Robert Triffin predicted, either the system would collapse or
alternative ways would be found to address this issue...

Disregarding this dilemma, unfortunately, advanced industrialized
countries pushed the expansion of trade and production beyond the
capacities of the postwar international economic order. The increasing
holding of the dollar outside the United States eventually forced the
U.S. government to unlink the dollar and gold. That action led to the
collapse of the Bretton Woods system"

Religions hark back to our pre-agro life, in terms of the social
contract and eating habits. Back then there were no rich people, and
some ppl could go hungry for a few days (sometimes the hunt doesnt go
well). So religions at their core both stress equality, and many have
fasting. This is an underhanded way of reminding ppl of our
origin.

Muller-Plantenberg: "Japan‚Äôs large and sustained current account
surpluses are at the root of its current economic problems. By pushing
up the yen very strongly over decades, Japan‚Äôs export boom has
contributed to the deflationary pressures from which the economy has
been suffering from for quite some time. Of course, removing the
external surplus would fix the problem according to the logic applied
here. Yet the current account is not a policy variable, and at any
rate a strong demand for Japanese exports seems to provide a welcome
stimulus for the economy. Policy makers naturally look for other kinds
of remedies, namely for measures they can potentially control.

What Scope for Monetary Policy? .. With interest rates hitting zero,
the Bank of Japan‚Äôs only way to induce money growth is to keep
printing money. But the BOJ has already bought government bonds, and
thus created money, on a large scale. The monetary base has increased
at an annual rate of almost 25 percent over the two years to 2003 (The
Economist, June 19, 2003). Yet this has not led to higher growth in
broad money. Instead, bank lending has continued to fall. Banks are
reluctant to lend, as they are already piled up with bad loans, a
problem that is only slowly being overcome. Moreover indebted firms
are unwilling to borrow as long as the deflation environment persists"

"'Believe all women' was always a flawed \#MeToo slogan. The impetus
for it was understandable: A sordid history of reflexively
disbelieving most women had to be overcome. And 'Don‚Äôt reflexively
disbelieve women; diligently investigate their claims' isn‚Äôt very
catchy. But the diligent investigation of claims and an absence of
stigma or vilification is what accusers require from the public
sphere, not masses of people taking to social media to proclaim, ‚ÄúI
believe.‚Äù

"Roosevelt and his advisers were far from the clairvoyant visionaries
of legend. They never had a master plan [Roos certainly did not win on
any 'plan' as challenger]. Rather, in the administration‚Äôs first 100
days, they implemented a flurry of laws and regulations. If those
programs worked, they remained. If they didn‚Äôt, they were dropped, to
be replaced by others.The National Industrial Recovery Act, for
example, with its voluntary codes of fair competition for prices and
wages and limited encouragement of collective bargaining proved
inadequate, and then was ruled unconstitutional. The administration
quickly developed alternatives, including the National Labor Relations
Act (known as the Wagner Act), which offered a clearer path to
unionization.Not until after 1935 did the New Deal‚Äôs welfare state of
Social Security, unemployment insurance, and public housing emerge"

EFF: "The House of Representatives has introduced new COVID-19
emergency response legislation to address the largest public health
and economic calamity the United States has faced in generations. Like
the crisis it is meant to address, the bill is massive. One provision
deserves particular attention: guaranteeing free Internet access if
you have been economically harmed by COVID-19 (as originally
envisioned in legislation promoted by Congressman Marc Veasey). ...

As various parts of it are renegotiated, Congress must keep in mind
that Internet access is vital and cannot be bargained away.

Many Americans have little to no choice among high-speed Internet
providers. And monopolies and near-monopolies have little to no
incentive to keep prices low or speeds high. This bill will address
the price part of the equation"

"Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) announced Tuesday that the state plans
to hire and train more than 1,300 contact tracers by the end of this
week in an effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus.

Inslee said the 1,371 contact tracers will allow more businesses to
open and more people to be active in public while helping to slow and
prevent the spread of COVID-19. Inslee's extended stay-at-home order
is currently set to expire at the end of May [...T]he information
about who came into contact with someone with a confirmed case of
COVID-19 will be confidential. Contacts will not be told the name of
the person who may have exposed them to COVID-19.

He said the plan involves contacting people within 24 hours of a
positive test result and talking to their close contacts within 48
hours....

In Washington, when someone tests positive for COVID-19, Inslee said
an interviewer will reach out by phone. They will ask who that person
has been in close contact with, then reach out to those other people
to let them know they have been exposed. Those people would need to
isolate or quarantine themselves, but there will be no enforcement"

‚ÄúIn \#HongKong, we‚Äôve managed to get away without needing a lockdown
because we‚Äôve been doing test and trace,‚Äù says Prof @bencowling88 of
@hkumed . ‚ÄúIf we weren‚Äôt doing test and trace, we would have needed
more social distancing instead.‚Äù

Libertard being against Space Force because it is "deficit spending"
is the most libertard shit ever. Guy thinks all gov undertakings are a
black hole that just sucks in money with no "return", "only businesses
innovate". If he created a list of how much inno came from space prog,
his eyes would pop out of their sockets.

Cop QM assumes an existing background, a non-changing geometry.

Yes, so geometry is not something fundamental, it needs to *emerge*
from something else, conceptually it takes the backseat to a primary,
more fundamental construct. Any theory of everything which assumes
certain geometry to be constant is in fact an insufficient theory of
everything.

"Principles for fundamental physics

1) Background independence.

A physical theory should not depend on structures which are fixed and
which do not evolve dynamically in interaction with other
quantities. This is a key concept, which takes some unpacking.

All physical theories to date depend on structures which are fixed in
time and have no prior justification; they are simply assumed and
imposed. One example is the geometry of space, in all theories prior
to general relativity. In Newtonian physics, the geometry of space is
simply fixed to be Euclidean three-dimensional geometry. It‚Äôs
arbitrary; it doesn‚Äôt change in time, it can‚Äôt be influenced by
anything. Hence it is not subject to dynamical law.

In Newton‚Äôs time, Euclid‚Äôs was the only geometry known, so he had no
alternative and didn‚Äôt need to seek a justification for choosing
it. But in the nineteenth century, Carl Friedrich Gauss, Nicholas
Lobachevsky, and Riemann discovered an infinitude of alternate
geometries. Any fundamental theory that comes after their work must
justify the choice it makes for the geometry of space. The principle
of background independence requires that the choice is made not by the
theorist, but by the theory, dynamically, as a part of solving the
laws of physics" -- Smolin

"'Now is a really crucial and pivotal time for the [UK] gas industry,'
says Dr Angie Needle, Director of Strategy at Cadent Gas... 'The Net
Zero legislation has set a completely new agenda, and Cadent have got
an amazing opportunity to be the delivery vehicle for green gases in
the future.'. Cadent deliver gas to 11 million customers. With the
Government aiming to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, the
organisation is working hard to demonstrate the gas industry‚Äôs role in
this transition. 'We know net zero has an end goal. But actually,
nobody's yet developed any particular goals for gas,' she says. ...

Dr Needle believes the decarbonisation of heat and the role of gas
distribution networks in support of this are the 'first problem to
solve.'. In the UK, 300 terawatt hours of electricity are used every
year, but this is dwarfed by the 900-terawatt hours of gas which is
used. 'In the grand scheme of the energy that the country needs, gas
far outweighs electricity. I'm always surprised at how little
attention it gets,' says Dr Needle"

New Trek Show announced, around the famed Captain Pike, played by
Anson Mount, great actor. 

Showrunners, producers, writers; don't botch this one up. Don't make
it cuck. Don't make it too woke. *Battlestar Galactica*, or *Lost*
level would be just fine, and these shows were progressive
already. Please keep the Orange Hitler allegories to yourself. Don't
get mad at us for saying these things, we are not your
competition. Your competition is *The Orville*, the Trek TNG show with
fart jokes. They are kicking your ass, dragging it across the room and
kicking it again.
