"UNSW researchers report mass hydrogen storage
breakthrough. [R]esearchers led by Kondo-Francois Aguey-Zinsou say
they have developed metal alloys capable of storing surplus
electricity in the form of hydrogen much more cheaply than lithium

Nice.. wonder what event he was referring to.. Russia-Persian war?

H. Marks: "Henry Kissinger was a member of [our] board when I worked
there, and a few times each year I was privileged to hear him hold
forth on world affairs. Someone would ask, 'Henry, can you explain
yesterday‚Äôs events in Bosnia?' and he‚Äôd say, 'Well, in 1722...' The
point is that chain reaction-type events can only be understood in the
context of that which went before."

*The Atlantic*: "As Donald Trump‚Äôs America continues to shatter records
for daily infections, France, like most other developed nations and
even some undeveloped ones, seems to have beat back the virus.The
numbers are not ambiguous. From a peak of 7,581 new cases across the
country on March 31, and with a death toll now just below 30,000‚Äîat
one point the world‚Äôs fourth highest‚Äîthere were just 526 new cases on
June 13, the day we masked ourselves and took the train back to
Paris. The caseload continues to be small and manageable. ..

America, however, is an utter disaster. Texas, Florida, and Arizona
are the newest hubs of contagion, having apparently learned nothing
from the other countries and states that previously experienced surges
in cases. I stared at my phone in disbelief when the musician Rosanne
Cash wrote on Twitter that her daughter had been called a ‚Äúliberal
pussy!‚Äù in Nashville for wearing a mask to buy groceries.That insult
succinctly conveys the crux of the problem. American leadership has
politicized the pandemic instead of trying to fight it. I see no
preparedness, no coordinated top-down leadership of the sort we‚Äôve
enjoyed in Europe"

The "people governance" part of populism is a crock, obviously. The
sorta thing you'll hear from second rate demagogues of Middle
East.. There is no such thing... As long as there is a concentrated,
centralized system, there will always be representative government
where leadership matters.

---

Part of the reason for the prevalence of this word "populism" is
because it provides cover for cons "doing bunch of leftist shit". All
of a sudden some of them started talking about worker rights, worker
paychecks, but they can't quite bring themselves to say these things
are leftist having demonized the word for so long, so they need a
different word, and that is populism.

Don't beat yourself up son. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, with
all that "euphoria", there is no way US would not end up tilting to
right especially since Reagan and HW were seen who crushed the
Soviets, two Republican presidents (just like Democrats winning WWII
gave their slant of governance legitimacy). Afterwards left would go
right, right would go insane, [polarization](../../2018/05/polarization.md)
would increase.. on and on.. 

Now there is need for some correction..

I remember that case, the way it was talked abt in corporate press and
among ppl was an example of overlitigation of US, as in some ambulance
chaser lawyer was now using coffee burns to make money.

"@kokoinkorea

[In 1994 let's] remember that McDonalds served their coffee at 190
degrees, which is hot enough to leave 3rd degree burns in just 3
seconds of contact with skin. They knew this and decided to serve the
coffee at 190 degrees because it had ...

a longer shelf life than serving it at the standard 160 degrees. They
calculated that burn related law suits would cost less than just
wasting coffee that wasn‚Äôt good anymore. They risked people getting
deadly burns to save money. And when the big law suit happened they
slandered ...

the victim, who had 3rd degree burns on 16% of her body and nearly
died from shock. They painted her out to be dumb for not realizing
that coffee would be hot and made it seem like a frivolous lawsuit of
someone who was trying to scam them.

also literally all the victim, Stella Liebeck, wanted was that
McDonalds pay her 20,000 medical bills because she was poor and
medicaid wouldn‚Äôt cover them. Then the media made her out to be a
greedy scammer"

If they chose to, fine; But if it turns out they are culturally so
different, and they are concentrated in a certain region, then local
governance..? In Germany south is Catholic, north is Protestan, and
guess what, local loc gov is strong. Conservatives of both regions
don't even compete against eachother. Con of south CSU and con of north
CDU govern together if elected, during elections stay out of
eachother's way.

Good good.. seeing more alternatives... One
[model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2822) makes QM as emergent, an
approximation, another re-drives gravity.

---

Erik V used to be a stringer, but quit it bcz it was going
nowhere. You don't need ST for emergent gravity, there are references
to a certain math used there that's it

---

Eric Verlinde: "Gravity has given many hints of being an emergent
phenomenon, yet up to this day it is still seen as a fundamental
force. The similarities with other known emergent phenomena, such as
thermodynamics and hydrodynamics, have been mostly regarded as just
suggestive analogies. It is time we not only notice the analogy, and
talk about the similarity, but finally do away with gravity as a
fundamental force.

Of course, Einstein‚Äôs geometric description of gravity is beautiful,
and in a certain way compelling. Geometry appeals to the visual part
of our minds, and is amazingly powerful in summarizing many aspects of
a physical problem. Presumably this explains why we, as a community,
have been so reluctant to give up the geometric formulation of gravity
as being fundamental. But it is inevitable we do so. If gravity is
emergent, so is space time geometry. Einstein tied these two concepts
together, and both have to be given up if we want to understand one or
the other at a more fundamental level"

This approach isn't abt [quantizing gravity](https://youtu.be/5foUTeRdqII?t=358)

---

There are two good things abt the Verlinde model now.. One, it has no
free parameters, two, it can explain dark matter (says it doesn't
exist, but explains why it is thought to be there).

His type of theory is called 'emergent gravity', he claims gravity
emerges from entropy and information. Like temparature is an emergent
property of particle interactions.
