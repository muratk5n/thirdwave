I thought more capitalism would get you better service, it was a
"no-brainer".

Dayen, *Monopolized*: "In 2014, Jet Blue decided it would zig while
the industry zagged. CEO David Barger declared that his company would
be the quality airline, with roomy, comfortable seating, free checked
bags, and fast Wi-Fi. For Barger, the announcement aligned JetBlue
with its founding principles: he had been there from the beginning,
helping design the company‚Äôs 'service-oriented' culture. 'I think you
can be profitable without gouging the traveling public,' Barger told a
local paper.

But stock analysts hated the idea. They beat up Barger for being
'overly concerned' with customers rather than shareholder returns. And
they eventually ran him out of town. Two months after Barger stepped
down, JetBlue rolled back the legroom and raised fees on baggage and
Wi-Fi. Analysts parceled out the 'improvements' to the penny. Charging
a baggage check fee would add 26¬¢ a share; charging for Wi-Fi would
add another 9¬¢. Springing fees on customers 'might hurt JetBlue in the
media,' wrote Cowen and Co. analyst Helane Becker in a research note,
but 'the revenue benefit to the company would probably trump any
customer push back.'

The episode reflects how, after government deregulation, Wall Street
has taken control of the airline industry and demanded oligopolistic
conformity"

"In two new studies, researchers have used microwaves to produce
hydrogen from plastic waste and water, respectively. ... 

In the new process, the researchers pulverize plastic in a kitchen
blender, mix it with a catalyst made of iron oxide and aluminum oxide,
and then zap it with microwaves at 1000 Watts. The microwaves trigger
the catalyst particles to strip over 97 percent of the hydrogen from
plastic in seconds ...

[For water the] technique involves blasting a ceramic oxide with
microwaves, which removes oxygen from the material and increases its
electrical conductivity. The activated ceramic material then
spontaneously reacts with water that is passed over it, forming
hydrogen and oxygen, which reoxygenates the ceramic so it can be
reused.

I can see how some HKers can fall into "expat nationalism". HK folk
aren't exactly expats (from the mainland) in the usual sense but some
could see themselves that way. And a lot of expats overseas who "left
the country and always plan to come back one day" do confuse their
nostalgia with analysis, since they dont live in the "home country"
either, they do not see all that's going on inside, so develop a blind
romantic attachment. Could be the issue here.

People dont like Jackie Chan anymore in Hong Kong? I was wondering abt
that, JC's bio sounded like he could devolve into a Ch nationalism,
and apparently he did.

"Trump [has] largely achieved their goal of choking off the flow of
unauthorized immigrants into the United States ‚Äî especially families
from Central America, many of whom come with the intention of
requesting asylum. ....

But the coronavirus has given the U.S. its most robust tool yet for
repelling asylum-seekers. An order signed by the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in March ...  prohibited the entry of
unauthorized immigrants from Mexico in the name of public health. The
order gave border agents the authority to simply expel them. In the
months since, 200,000 migrants have been expelled, either to Mexico or
to their home countries. None have been given the opportunity to
request asylum or explain why they believed they would be persecuted
if they returned to their homelands.

The combination of international agreements, health concerns and new
tactics has effectively shut the border. So far, none of the elements
in the administration‚Äôs new 'waterproof fabric' have been overturned
in court or become the subject of public uproar, as family separation
did in 2018"

Theo James is a good lead. *How It Ends* was a perfectly watchable
movie.

That's wild.

I can see how such a carrier would be sub (!) optimal, every ounce of
air in a sub is bought with a certain weight penalty; but I appreciate
the attempt. Creative.

This is purely anecdotal, and I don't want to jinx it, but I don't

Nearly all upcoming action movie trailers suck. Even the Ryan Reynolds
movie looks better.
