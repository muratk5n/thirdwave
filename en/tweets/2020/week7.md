No. Rituals don't create culture. Culture has to do with codes,
embedded in emotional brain which are transmitted through osmosis, and
they effect *decisions*. Putting a funky hat on, playing with some
beads, mumbling some nonsense is not culture.

Exactly - where you are born matters. She is French. People who tell
her otherwise need to shut the fonk up, and she should remind them of
that.

Parents - stop telling children abt their "home country". They ain't
you, they'll never be you. You made that decision for them when you
moved your punk ass to where you are now from your (very likely)
shithole country. They won't belong to your original homeland just for
the virtue of being your children.

When Libya production went down, who made up the shortfall? Who
benefited?  Corr analysis to the rescue. Oil production as time series
for multiple countries, get corr matrix (it gives corr of everything
against everything else, incredibly useful), find who has the highest
neg value against Libya.


```python

today = datetime.datetime.now()

US and Iraq (now tied to US I guess) benefited. So wanna help Iraq,
wanna help yourself?  Knock out Libya, you sell more of your product.

Below is oil production data for the world and Libya. Since 2011
Libyan civil war their production was hammered, but world production
went upwards, unscatched. Clearly someone picked up the slack and that
someone benefited.

When it comes to oil chicanery, "taking the oil" may not be the only
game in town. "Denying the oil to someone else", "crippling oil
production somewhere so somewhere else can produce more" are probably
all in the playbook.


```python
from pandas_datareader import data

today = datetime.datetime.now()

I see.. good behind-the-scenes ppl shuffling skillz, knock out that
piece, freeze that guy, etc. Good capability on ad targeting, and of
course, unlimited war chest.

Still no guarantee though all that will work against Trump. DJT showed
an ability to bypass usual channels and reach people. The contrast
angle doesn't work either. Two uber-rich people, both from Manhattan.

A side effect to the such is public sphere overcrowding with drama
queens. Lowest hanging fruit, one-step solutions are tried
already. The remaining ones are moronic and intractable, so it takes a
lot of energy and drama to mobilize towards them. Then there is drama
afterwards when things invariably fail because the direction was dumb
in the first place.

All that could be avoided with a little foresight. Not much, just a
little.

---

Most of the stuff I advocate is nothing special - but I try to take
two steps instead of one.

Taking one step from the established understanding of QM takes you to
all the chaos we see on TV, ppl running around confused, going back,
forward in time, space. If we take one step in Einstein's direction,
then take another towards QM as approximation, the rest makes more
sense.

Or popular view on energy says 'I have batteries on laptop duuude,
wanna put it in my car'. Better is generate clean fuel (step 1), then
next step put it in the car (step 2). Two very simple steps, that
require some upfront investment sure, but doable.

We are stuck, on a lot of fronts. I don't think a single one step, as
"courageous" it might seem, will provide any more Earth shattering
solutions. No more superhero-ish, cult leaders. Just boring, able
people trying to lay groundwork for two steps ahead.

Credit card debt nearly doubled since the 08 crisis. Now it is over 4
__trillion__. Did ppl's income double? No. 

That is 13K $ debt per person - man, woman, and child, where most ppl
cannot come up with $500 for an emergency. The interest rate on this
debt is not favorable - per @RaoulGMI. So it cannot be paid. Someone
will burn. In a post 08 world, I dont think it will be ordinary people

‚ÄúWe speak of machines that think, learn, and infer. The name of the
discipline itself‚Äîartificial intelligence‚Äîpractically dares us to
compare our human modes of reasoning with the behavior of
algorithms. Such rhetoric is at best misleading and at worst downright
dangerous.‚Äù

I don't hear bankers complain about 'big government' when taxpayers
hand them a trillion-dollar bailout.

I don't see drug companies grumble when 'big government' gives them
patent monopolies to charge sky-high prices.

I don't know who's more corrupt: Wall Street or Big Pharma"

Corporations have dumped toxic 'forever chemicals' into our
environment. It's now in 43 cities' water supplies.

My bill forces these companies to pay for the cleanup.

Maybe I'm 'radical,' but I think the water in our taps must be free of
toxic chemicals"

Mmm good shit. It's basically bunch of pistacio, almonds and dried

Honey is great - they say it has healing effects.

Sean Carroll.. what a jerkoff. This guy is everywhere trying to sell
his shit, I guess attempting to do through popular media what he can't
do in theoretical science. His particular slant is perfect for movies,
would come across pleasing to drugged-up guru seeking sponge brains.

Instead of looking for f-ing universes in multiples, wouldn't it be
better to build upon "space-as-an-illusion" idea - a route already
hinted at by Einstein who showed space-time can bend? Take the next
step, show space is not primary but emergent, and show QM falls out of
this as an approximation.

But no, let's make a struggling actor's job harder.. Now not only do
they have to play the hero, but also the evil twin, in the same
episode from a different universe. This is exploitation. They are now
working double time, the goatee itches, and there is always that
annoying draft up the crack of your ass thanks to the leather pant
with the butt cut-out; an indispensible part of the evil twin
visual.

Right - if space is emergent, an illusion, that solves nonlocality of
entanglement. There is no "spooky action at a distance" because there
is no distance.

Smolin: "If locality is not absolute, if it is the contingent result
of dynamics, it will have defects and exceptions. And indeed, this
appears to be the case: how else are we to understand quantum
nonlocality, particularly nonlocal entanglement? These, I would
hypothesize, are remnants of the spaceless relations inherent in the
primordial stage, before space emerges"

---

Smolin: "I drew a lesson from a survey of approaches to quantum
foundations, which is that space and time cannot both be
fundamental. Only one can be present at the deepest level of
understanding; the other must be emergent and contingent. This seems
ultimately to be forced on us by the nonlocality of entanglement,
which leads to a tension between realist approaches to quantum
mechanics and special relativity. The latter unifies space and time
into spacetime, which the experimental tests of Bell‚Äôs restriction
suggest is transcended in individual quantum processes. I would then
like to suggest that the tension is resolved by making one of the pair
space/time fundamental, while the other is an emergent and approximate
description, ultimately a kind of illusion. For many reasons, some
described here, some the subject of earlier books,1 I choose to focus
on the hypothesis that time is fundamental, while space is emergent."

Interesting... I'd say let the fossil mofos live a little, but all
that flaring biz in Texas was truly infuriating. If methane leaks,
flaring, and other side effects can be regulated, then blue.

One good thing with blue would be enticing Russians to switch over to
it, but they also have sunlight don't they? And an obscene amount of
landmass.

If not, hammer time. Green Blitzkrieg.

"A split has emerged within the German cabinet as to whether its
forthcoming national hydrogen strategy should exclusively support
green hydrogen produced from renewable energy or include so-called
'blue hydrogen' produced from fossil fuels with the carbon captured

Great. Now let's add the automagic-money-creation-per-user,
digital-basic-income feature so money base expands, everyone has money
for basics, we can then have the digital currency of the future.

Nano on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nano_\(cryptocurrency\)):
"Nano is a decentralized, open-source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency
released under the FreeBSD License. It facilitates feeless and
fast-settling transactions without intermediaries by utilizing a
distributed ledger. Nano‚Äôs goal is to address the scalability
limitations of Bitcoin, which can result in restrictive fees and
increased transaction confirmation times when under load. Unlike other
cryptocurrencies, Nano does not rely on mining or transaction fees,
and transactions typically confirm in 0.25-10 seconds.

The Nano protocol functions by employing a block-lattice data
structure, a unique implementation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG),
in addition to a voting-based consensus algorithm called Open
Representative Voting. Accounts on the Nano network each have their
own blockchain, which enables transactions to be quickly processed
asynchronously. The transactions are then voted on by user-selected
representative nodes before being immutably confirmed"

Did NAFTA cause Mex immigration increase to US? Analysis below says
no. Looked at immig annual increase averages - before and after
NAFTA. I don't see an increase.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(index=np.arange(1910,2010))
df['immig'] = pd.read_csv('mex.csv',index_col=0).immig
df = df.interpolate()
chg = df.pct_change()
print (np.round(np.float(chg[df.index <= 1993].mean()),2))
print (np.round(np.float(chg[df.index >  1993].mean()),2))

"The potential of the algae-bacteria combination has been proven and
opens the doors to its being used in industry since the sugar added
for bacteria fermentation in the lab can be transferred to waste in

hydrogen"
