Sure, but, when they get out, they cause a stir because it's
Google. Then the only next step the company can take to offset that
splash with another splash, firing the employee.

This is the downside of working at a company like Google, right? There
are upsides, go to a bar, show off to women saying you work for
Google. But then there is the downside, the scrutiny. Cant have one
wout the other.

"But that fired Google guy and many others talk freely about stuff on

"Mazzucato was increasingly interested in what she called
mission-oriented organisations. The prime example was DARPA, the
research agency founded by President Eisenhower in 1958 following the
Soviet Union‚Äôs launch of Sputnik. The agency pumped billions of
dollars into the development of prototypes that preceded commercial
technology such as Microsoft Windows, videoconferencing, Google Maps,
Linux and the cloud. In Israel, Yozma, a government-backed venture
capital fund that ran between 1993 and 1998, supported more than 40
companies. In the UK, the Government Digital Service, launched in
2010, was behind the award-winning .gov.uk domain, saving the
government ¬£1.7bn in IT procurement. ‚ÄúWhen I use the word ‚Äòstate‚Äô I am
talking about a decentralised network of different state agencies,"
she says. When such agencies are mission-oriented to solve problems
and structured to take risks, they can be an engine of innovation.‚Äù

To Mazzucato, the epitome of the mission-oriented concept was the
Apollo programme, the space programme designed to land Americans on
the Moon and return them safely to Earth. Between 1960 and 1972, the
US government spent $26bn (¬£21bn) to achieve precisely that. More than
300 different projects contributed, not only in aeronautics but in
areas such as nutrition, textiles, electronics and medicine, resulting
in 1,800 spinoff products, from freeze-dried food to cooling suits,
spring tyres and digital fly-by-wire flight control systems used in
commercial airplanes. The programme was also instrumental in
kick-starting an industry for the integrated circuit"

Hah. I guess there is an "example nation" that every mother uses for
their children to urge them to finish their plates. Apparently it was
"starving Ethiopoans" in US recently (says the interviewee), but
before that, it was "starving Armenians". That's the one Peterson
heard growing up, and one day becomes curious where it came from,
decides to research it, and ends up writing another book this time on
the infamous "alleged" terrible events, and US' response to it.

Party leaders must make this decision, seeing it will be in their

leader.

Leftist ideas were orphaned due to years of mainstream neglect. But
there was a price to pay for this, ordinary people's living standards
fell. Surprisingly the mainstream kept ignoring "the fringe", so
finally, some in the right adopted some of those ideas. This is Trump,
and others, some calling themselves in weird names not to offend the
*nomenklatura*. The intention was to help, should be congratulated
even though it is not sustainable IMO. Left / Right mix is toxic, you
are either one side or the other. So one party must adapt this shit --
otherwise the balance is lost.

Here's the news headline I was looking for in my news feed: "Congress
panel concludes GAFA companies have monopoly power". *France 24* had a
*video* with this title, but noone had the text thing. Corporatized
news dissing news on monopoly? At the same time they don't like
Facebook, they could have used this chance to flame them.

Doesn't work. Neither side trusts you, and you end up being hated by
both. You could say Macron tried this in France, do some left, do some
right, but make one wrong move, ppl dont like your style, you end up
with protests ad-infinitum.

"Okay, so dont be lukewarm center, but why can't you mix and match
clear policies from both sides?"

There is no Judeo-Christian identity in US, there is only Christian
identity, and specifically Protestan identity (there are other
elements in the culture code too, but insofar a religion has effect it
is Protestanism). Even atheists or Jews or others get it through
osmosis.

"Except that tradition never existed.The 'Judeo-Christian tradition'
was one of 20th-century America‚Äôs greatest political inventions. An
ecumenical marketing meme for combatting godless communism, the
catchphrase long did the work of animating American conservatives in
the Cold War battle. For a brief time, canny liberals also embraced
the phrase as a rhetorical pathway of inclusion into postwar American
democracy for Jews, Catholics, and Black Americans. In a world divided
by totalitarianism abroad and racial segregation at home, the notion
of a shared American religious heritage promised racial healing and
national unity. ... American Jews themselves were reluctant
adopters. After centuries of Christian anti-Semitic persecution and
philo-Semitic fantasies of Jewish conversion, many eyed the award of
an honorary hyphen with suspicion. Even some anti-communist
politicians themselves recognized the concept as ill-suited to
America‚Äôs postwar quest for global primacy in a decolonizing world.The
mythical 'Judeo-Christian tradition,' then, proved an unstable
foundation on which to build a common American identity"

Everyone from Joe Biden, the Democrats‚Äô presumptive presidential
nominee, to Saudi Aramco, the world‚Äôs largest oil company, is
ostensibly on board with hydrogen.

Biden‚Äôs¬†recently expanded¬†climate and energy plan supports using
renewable energy to make 'carbon-free hydrogen' at the same cost it
does from making it with natural gas.

"As the world seeks to rebuild from the coronavirus pandemic, support
is pouring in for hydrogen energy to cut carbon emissions¬†....

Of the 54 billion dollars in economic stimulus funding approved in
countries around the world (but mostly Europe) that‚Äôs going toward
clean energy, 19% of that is for hydrogen.¬†...

In just the past month‚Ä¶

The European Union, which is proposing an additional 500 billion
dollars or more for green energy as part of its recovery, unveiled
a¬†sweeping hydrogen strategy¬†and targets for hydrogen made from
renewable energy.

The U.S.-based conglomerate Air Products & Chemicals¬†announced
plans¬†to build in Saudi Arabia what it says will be the world‚Äôs
largest hydrogen plant powered by renewable energy.

The U.S. Energy Department announced 64 million worth dollars of
funding for hydrogen projects earlier this month and plans to invest
up to 100 million dollar over five years for two new research efforts
on hydrogen.

'In my view, hydrogen is today where solar was 10 years ago,' Birol
said. He expects costs to decline as governments grow policies
supporting it like they did with solar"
