So this thing basically runs on its own - making energy out of thin
air.. How is this not a replacement for the current way we generate
energy?

Another dataset on democracies. BTI Transformation Index that
evaluates aspects of governance for selected countries is updated for
2020.

Data on [Downloads](https://www.bti-project.org/en/meta/downloads.html).  I
looked at TR vs RU (using the Stata file),

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_stata('BTI 2006-2020.dta')
df = df.set_index('year')
df1 = df[df.country == 'Russia'].dem_stat
df2 = df[df.country == 'Turkey'].dem_stat
df3 = pd.concat([df1,df2],axis=1)
df3.columns = ['RU','TR']
df3.plot()
plt.savefig('bti.png')
```

<img width="340"  src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EW6oGScWoAEtRYN?format=png&name=small"/>

TR approached RU values lately, major degradation. Still better than
RU but these ppl spent decades under one-party state while TR did
not. Shouldn't the difference be higher?

There are some interesting columns in there,

```python
print (list(df.columns))
```

```text
['country', 'country_code', 'region', 'rank_stat_ind',
'stat_ind', 'rank_dem_stat', 'dem_stat', 'stateness', 'monopoly',

```

`judiciary`? `prop_right`? Looks interesting. 

This dataset can be useful for researchers. There is a codebook
describing all the columns.

World oil [production](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/xls/Fig6.xlsx), from [IEA](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/data.php) 

I guess data for production before April are real, but the rest is
projection. It'd be great to supply data as one CSV, and a CSV per
concept, like `world-production.csv` with simple format so ppl dont
have to dig through the cells like I did.

```python
# Unit million bbls per day
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel('/tmp/Fix6.xlsx')
arr = np.array(df)[25:50,3:5]
df2 = pd.DataFrame(arr)

I was thinking M4A a good compromise solution for affordable and
humane care but maybe UK method is even better (all health is managed
directly by gov, reports to PM). Johnson keeps saying how they work
hard to flatten the curve bcz "we had to prevent our NHS from being
overwhelmed" - now that's a thing a politician can observe and
optimize on, bcz it is directly under their purview in UK, which it
turns out to be something useful for the populace at large. It is
always good to have the right incentives in place... So pol can do
things to protect NHS which in turn protects the public.

In US federal pols could be like ... meh.. I dont know.. there are
bunch of hospitals out there and stuff, ppl can go there.. and like,
fend for themselves? And we'll, like, save COBRA or something.. Just
wave a hand and dismiss the problem bcz it doesnt effect any
bureucracy they control directly.

I am not saying pols necessarily dont care for people, but in some
instances it is not clear what to __do__ about the problem, which
gears to __turn__ to cause change. For UK it is very simple - protect
NHS. Expand NHS - if necessary. I am sure they have a lively research
arm and can put out some good solutions - well, that's great. Help NHS
to research, or coordinate research with others, unis so forth. The
research results too can then be used directly, through NHS, wout this
talk of patents, executive orders, etc. During the time of emergency
it is beyond distasteful to hear of this stuff.

"The death toll from coronavirus may be almost 60 per cent higher than
reported in official counts, according to an FT analysis of overall
fatalities during the pandemic in 14 countries.

Mortality statistics show 122,000 deaths in excess of normal levels
across these locations, considerably higher than the 77,000 official
Covid-19 deaths reported for the same places and time periods.

If the same level of under-reporting observed in these countries was
happening worldwide, the global Covid-19 death toll would rise from
the current official total of 201,000 to as high as 318,000"

"@TheBubbleBubble

Believe it or not, the U.S. student loan bubble temporarily lowered
the unemployment rate: many people who couldn't find jobs after the
Great Recession simply took on a ton of student loans and went back to
school. Voil√† - they no longer counted as unemployed! It's magic!"

The NBER [paper](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21967.pdf)

"An NBER paper issued last year concluded that changes to federal
student loans are more than sufficient to explain tuition increases at
private nonprofit colleges...

Unlike most other student loan programs, PLUS loans are not
capped‚Äîparents may borrow up to the cost of attendance, which is
determined by the college. This creates incentives for colleges to
increase student charges, since the federal government will make sure
all eligible parents have access to the money"

"[T]here is another viewpoint [different from electric grids] from
which these possible new electric-power-demand-boosting developments
do not look such good news. It‚Äôs based on a rival assessment of what
makes sense in terms of meeting energy needs ‚Äî the use of gas as an
energy vector. This option is claimed to be more efficient and less
costly than electricity for heating, and possibly for other purposes.

It is certainly easier to transmit gas with lower energy losses. And
it can be stored, unlike electricity"

Yes some countries in fact do not allow free camping. This needs to
change.

"[Autotranslated] According to the World Bank, over 77 percent of
people in Germany live in cities. And these cities don't offer enough
space for everyone. If the Germans who love to travel stay in the
country this summer, .. there will be even less free terrain left
here, the double arm length will be a distant dream. Nature waits in
front of the city: forest and agriculture make up over 80 percent of
land use in Germany.

The townspeople just have to go outside. Not to the eternally the same
and soon overcrowded destinations such as Bastei Bridge, Drachenfels
or the Travem√ºnder Ostseestrand, but in the nameless and contagious
forest, in the Weserbergland, the Elfringhauser Switzerland or the
Fl√§ming.

It is therefore necessary to allow wild camping in the country. The
Scandinavian right of public could serve as a model: The allemansr√§tt
, as it is called in Sweden, not only allows free access to nature -
this is also known as the "right of access" in Germany. It also allows
camping in the wild and only imposes restrictions, such as a minimum
distance from the sleeping area to houses"
