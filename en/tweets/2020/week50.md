I remember that pencil-neck motherlover, Mogg, using this "regulation
arbitrage" argument for Brexit... Seriously.. Moron actually thought
EU would just sit on their ass and do nothing? How effin dumb are
these people?

---

This "matching regulation" biz reveals all you need to know about
Brexit; it's like Brexiters want EU do whatever they're told.. If UK
reduces regulation, EU wld say 'we can raise tariffs to balance that'
bcz UK is more attractive in that env (seemingly at least, at first)
and EU says 'we dont want to lose business to arbitrage', after
breakup UK not being part of that "we". UK says now 'you shouldn't do
that'. Well after Brexit you are "free", and so are they... Why
shouldn't they do what's good for them? They must follow your
directives?

I think the ruling clique in UK still has that imperialist posh
cuntness in them, B-Team or not.. Stiff upper lip Eton
sockcuckers. Albeit with less stiff upper lip, more relaxed demeanor,
but still reeegal.

Offline synch of components / people / work is the way to go 

Toffler, R. Wealth: "Early industrial economies operated under
completely different temporal conditions. Assembly-line work required
a different rhythm. Thus, the factory whistle and the time clock were
invented to coordinate work schedules.  By contrast, today, ...  the
uses of time are becoming increasingly personalized and irregular, if
not erratic. More different tasks need to be integrated, and the
acceleration effect truncates the time available for each task. All
this makes synchronization harder to achieve"

other subjects. This was the 'overt curriculum.' But beneath it lay an
invisible or 'covert curriculum' that was far more basic. It
consisted‚Äîand still does in most industrial nations‚Äîof three courses:
one in punctuality, one in obedience, and one in rote, repetitive
work. Factory labor demanded workers who showed up on time, especially
assembly-line hands. It demanded workers who would take orders from a
management hierarchy without questioning. And it demanded men and
 women prepared to slave away at machines or in offices, performing
brutally repetitious operations"

While the list of services Google offers keeps growing, an alleged
violation can single-handedly lock you out of all the services. Over a
month later, multiple closed-without-reply appeals and 2 employees
personally taken a look, I still don't have access to my data"

Raw politics cld be playing a part.. back then Dems did not want to
help Trump, and now Reps do not want to help Biden?

"@GunnelsWarren

We could have had a $1.8 trillion COVID relief bill in October with
direct payments to the working class to help pay the rent and food. It
is shameful that we‚Äôre being asked to support a 900 billion bill with
corporate immunity and nothing for the working class"

Pro debt / anti debt... The right answer depends on the (ideologically
distinct) party. Oscillation btw the two will lead to an optimal final
IMO, in the long run..but neither is an illegitimate position. See
[Austerity](../../2020/07/austerity.md).

There is some good culture / precedent / regulation around DOJ. Like
Prez cant fire ppl directly but appoint ppl who could, in theory? But
then those ppl are hemmed in with regulation, which they can change,
but its hard. POTUS can always fire for refusal of firing others, but
then you get special prosecutors jammed up your ass, by the courtesy
of Congress.

US fought a lot with racism, at gov level.. One of the main actions of
the Justice Department late 1800s was persecuting Klan members. Lota
Klansmen were sent to federal prisons bcz of DOJ.

Is there "dignity in work" if the work is made-up work and useless?
People shld fight for UBI rather than being paid to dig holes and fill
them back up again.

And the charge cycle... How many times can the said "efficient"
charge/recharge be done? 1000 times? Then what? "Recycle the battery",
having to deal with all that frickin acid..? No thank you.

---

We cant ship batteries easily, their energy density is too low. Energy
needs to be shipped to it. Its misinformed proponents are all about
"the grid" for this reason. But the grid is inefficient itself, so
even combined with "efficient" monkey, the whole system is as good as
fossil.

"We'll update the grid", then we have another problem which is not
enough lithium to go around. Existing reserves can only cover 10% of
today's storage needs, 1% projected. That is one rare monkey.

---

It is too specialized, for one. Widely used systems need to be build
around agile, common components. Batteries are like that circus monkey
performing that one trick very well, but we need a Swiss army knife
not a circus monkey. The animal cld be fine, rare, handles one case
superbly. But how about many other tasks?

"Batteries can store and allow energy retrieval efficiently. What is wrong with that?"
