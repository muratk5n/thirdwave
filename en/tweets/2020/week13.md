Goldtards, libertards are eagerly waiting for a dollar collapse -
"will it be our time..? is it this time.. is it?" Bitcointards are
right next to them, hoping to get some spoils.

"@teatotalitarian

The damage without intervention is incalcuable.  You can't sell to
people with no $ or jobs.  The economy was struggling post fires. You
cant stimulate an economy by saddling all with more private debt. Be
like NZ 80% subsidies and rent mortgage/freezes. NZ will emerge
unscathed"

Maybe there is no need for most optimization, an interpolation does
huge amt of work already, there is a constant push-and-pull to explain

"But I know a company which can grow as much". Sure, that is
possible. Others might think the same about other companies and buy
their shares, expecting that kind of growth. My point is all of these
people cannot be right at the same time. Hence, winners and losers.

Or at least there has to be.. If gov steps in and saves all the losers
then there is no market. Enter socialism.
