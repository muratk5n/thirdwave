Why is the use of renewable fuel, even if produced from fossil,
preferable?

Easier enforcement.

Fossil fuel at the end-user can leak, emission more likely. Carmakers
can cheat (see the Volkswagen 2015 scandal).

But if gov encourages, enforces clean fuel production at the source,
even with CCS, or even better 100% clean production, then all the way
down the line, beginning, middle, the end, we know there can be no
leaks, no emissions. No need to police Volkswagen, or Honda, Toyota,
etc. their fuel-cell car will have no choice but be clean.

Noted W was mentioned; big deal coming from a former oilman.

"Green hydrogen, an alternative fuel generated with clean energy, is
experiencing a global resurgence and has been identified as the clean
energy source that could help bring the world to net-zero emissions in
the coming decades.

It was initially touted in the U.S. during President George W. Bush's
first term, when it was nicknamed the "freedom fuel."

Now, President-elect Joe Biden is promising that the U.S. will be able
to access green hydrogen at the same cost as conventional hydrogen
within a decade as part of his clean energy plan. Several countries
around the world already invest heavily into it, including Chile,
Japan, Saudi Arabia, Germany and Australia"

Working with hair-splitting detail as programmer, is much more intense
than, say, in social sciences bcz at the end of the day programmatic
concepts, however abstract at first, need to *compile*, i.e. accepted
by a software compiler to be turned into machine code. So programmers
in some ways have compilers in their heads, that does strict
checks. Obviously every spoken language has also syntactic rules, but
none that can be verified instantly, to its tiniest comma, and can be
executed on-demand. So we run the compiler in our heads before
submitting code to the machine, we want to see as little errors as
possible, which makes it a stringent task. Do it a long time, you
really want to see that rapping dog at the end of the day. .

theory begins by assuming that the atomic constituents undergo small

atoms are assumed and interactions are introduced as weak
perturbations. In the case of liquids, however, the interactions are
