Excellent. More of this. Total job killer.

But, I have to make this clear, this is still an example of weak AI,
not a "thinking machine". The task sounds very focused where 1 can get
training data easily which suits Deep Shit approaches.

it. This is a fulcrum point. This ain't school where student is

too is very much conducted this way.

Battery swapping instead of waiting for recharge (bcz bitch BEV
charging is incredibly slow) is an obscenely bad idea. Now instead of
N batteries, market needs N + N batteries, half of them unused at any
one time, placing extra strain on the environment (more lithium,
cobalt mining). Standardization wld be pain, Mercedes bats need to be
same as Toyota bats etc.

Clean chemical fuel is inherentely standardized - it is fuel, it is
simple, carrying lots of energy.

The vision for peace is not my \#1 preference but at least the map
looks less patchy than some of the earlier plans.

But if Israel wants Jordan Valley to cut Pals off from possible
influence coming from Jordan, the optics of the proposed scheme is
bad. It looks like giving ppl a semblance of a state and kind of put
them in a desert island. Their only allies can be Egypt.

Isn't Jordan kind of an Israeli protectorate anyway? What kind of
threat could come from there?

By trying to prepare *every* kind of threat, Pal state is isolated
unnecessarily.

"It's been a long, long time since there's been legitimate price
discovery in the markets. At the end of the day, when you look at even
equities, equities are ultimately the derivative of the credit
markets. They're just the thing at the bottom of the capital
stack. Over time, people compare dividend yield on stocks with yields
on debt.

That entire structure has been distorted by monetary authorities
effectively underpricing the front end of the term structure of risk
reward."

Out of the three, GF might have had the better deal. Great career,

It's true the 3rd Ali-Frazier fight took too much out of them ("we
went to Manilla as champs, came back as old men"). Some style pairings
are a natural tie. No need to push it. Foreman beats Frazier, Ali
beats Foreman, then Ali has trouble with Frazier. The calculus is out
