"If you havenâ€™t yet heard about green hydrogen, youâ€™re about toâ€”in a
big way. The universeâ€™s most abundant element is among the hotter
topics in the halls of industry and government from Australia to Saudi
Arabia, along with a number of Asian, American and European
nations. By many accounts, we will soon see green hydrogen â€” green
because itâ€™s produced with renewables â€” become a new multi-trillion
dollar commodity sector, transform the energy industry and play a
critical role in fighting climate change"

We've clearly lost some ground here...nowadays an army of actual
scientist cannot see a blatant thing like lithium batteries [not
being](https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2020/07/h2-numbers.html#lithium)
fit for an overall climate solution. They apparently lost their
ability to add and subtract.  There is no shortage of useless
theories, multiple universes, strings, quantum this and that... but
simple arihtmetic?  No can do.

Good scifi foresight does exist. AC Clarke talked abt satellites way

Sun energy falling on Earth in terms of (radiation) energy is 1000
W/m2. Solar panel efficiency is 20%. Take good daylight 1/4 of a
day. 

```python
area = 25 # m2
"%0.f Kwh from %d m2 area" % (0.2 * 0.25 * 24 * 25, area)
```

```text
Out[1]: '30 Kwh from 25 m2 area'
```

A house in US used 28.9 kWh per day (EIA, in 2017). 25 m2 is enough to
power the house (ignoring storage efficiency).

Alex Jones saz Trump cut off external lobbyists but then his circle
was carpetbombed with money so they became lobbyists indirectly
(\#rogan podcast). Could be true.. If so, good observation. See,
if this man is cut off due to (IMO) weird climate change denialism,
then you miss out on the occasional good observation. Censoring is bad

Cant go to the movies? Movie theathers were overrated anyway...

2W was about
[synchronization](../../2011/03/fundamentals-of-industrial-ideologies_synchronization.md);
in entertainment, in production, in ed. There can still be a place
called school, somewhere outside of home, kids are dropped off useful
for cases when home env is stressful, but ed itself will be be
asynch. Class would not "start" or "end" -- kid simply goes and picks
up tablet and continues where he left off from the previous day. A
