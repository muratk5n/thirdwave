# Week 36


The WMD sensitivity has to do with the new strategy focus of US after
9/11. US has natural protection against invading armies (Mexico being
an exception -which is harmless- and..  there is the military behemoth
called Canada of course), short range navies, the only remaining
dangers can come in in the form of 1) people 2) weapons with
asymmetric effect. That is why post 9/11 two major issues were 1)
immigration 2) wmd. WMD sensitivity requires hunting for this stuff
proactively, anywhere in the world because you never know which
crazy-ass idiot will get his hands on one and take it to somewhere
else. That is the current logic.

This US focus is known to all strategists. After 9/11 some went 'aha,
focus gonna change', and tada. It's that kind of thing. It makes
certain amount of sense too, but whether it makes sense or not, that
is what "ppl in the know" know about US priorities. Hence the red
lines, talk of punishment etc.

"Are we making too much of chemical weapons? Probably less than 1 percent
of those killed in Syria have died of nerve gas attacks. In Syria, a 
principal weapon of mass destruction has been the AK—47."
