# AdSense

Thanks to Google many regular ppl can make $$ (untypical for a software company, which, like 80/90s Microsoft, were mostly there to extort money from customers taking advantage of some kind of choke point, e..g OEMs through Windoze). We are grateful for G. being a different kinda company. You bled money to M$. We make money with G. Now some suggestions.

The issues probably revolve around the "ultimate legacy system of all time" - the financial system because these sad losers are in such obscenely repugnant state of being, whatever they touch goes to shit. I believe this is the root cause of AdSense problems.

The accounts get "stuck" to the country you create them. Say acc was created in country #1, now it cannot be changed to country #2. Adding payment methods will ask a bank account in country #1.

Account gets stuck to the channel - sign up through YouTube, you cant simply use a blog, or GH pages easily. You are asked to "add the site" to "upgrade", include an HTML code, but the system wants www.host.com style name, not blah.blahblah.io/some/url (must be top level domain name). Weird. User's expectation is: I have an AdSense acc, I should be able to drop ad code from this account to whereever I like, get paid in whichever country. Not possible right now.

And why are we still dealing with banks? Can't Google be a bank? Payouts to Bitcoin? Is that possible?

BTW in terms of finance legalese, opening bank accounts should not be tied to any address. If there are any restrictions in countries on this, it is a major show stopper. Life is changing towards mobility, not towards stay-where-you-are-fuck-your-goat-live-on-a-patch-of-land stability. There is no more agrarian living. There is no widespread industrial living. Systems need to change to reflect that.
