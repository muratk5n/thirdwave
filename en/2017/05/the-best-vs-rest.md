# The Best vs. The Rest

In this paper, we aim to bring the debate on the global productivity slowdown – which has largely been
conducted from a macroeconomic perspective – to a more micro-level. We show that a particularly striking
feature of the productivity slowdown is not so much a lower productivity growth at the global frontier, but
rather rising labour productivity at the global frontier coupled with an increasing labour productivity divergence
between the global frontier and laggard (non-frontier) firms. This productivity divergence remains after
controlling for differences in capital deepening and mark-up behaviour, suggesting that divergence in measured
multi-factor productivity (MFP) may in fact reflect technological divergence in a broad sense. This divergence
could plausibly reflect the potential for structural changes in the global economy – namely digitalisation,
globalisation and the rising importance of tacit knowledge – to fuel rapid productivity gains at the global
frontier. Yet, aggregate MFP performance was significantly weaker in industries where MFP divergence was
more pronounced, suggesting that the divergence observed is not solely driven by frontier firms pushing the
boundary outward. We contend that increasing MFP divergence – and the global productivity slowdown more
generally – could reflect a slowdown in the diffusion process. This could be a reflection of increasing costs for
laggard firms of moving from an economy based on production to one based on ideas. But it could also be
symptomatic of rising entry barriers and a decline in the contestability of markets. We find the rise in MFP
divergence to be much more extreme in sectors where pro-competitive product market reforms were least
extensive, suggesting that policy weaknesses may be stifling diffusion in OECD economies.

Interesting. IIUC productivity growth has not slowed, the top dogs innovate madly, the "lower" tier companies is where the slowdown occured. Paper says policy is at fault.
