S. Meyers does A. Sorkin sketch. Sorkin was the writer of the The
American President, and and of course The West Wing. This reminded me
a quote by Sorkin, he said once that he doesn't try to make his
characters be smart, he just makes them sound smart. It shows too, bcz
I can tell a lot of what these ppl say on screen is utter
bullshit. But it sounds good - a reflection of politics these days
maybe?

As part of his "Mexican outreach" Conan got himself a role on a
Mexican soap opera. It's awesome.
