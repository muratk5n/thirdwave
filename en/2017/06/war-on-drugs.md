# War on Drugs

Today, the United States has the largest prison population in the
world. Americans make up only 5 percent of the world’s population, but
25 percent of the world’s prisoners. And a huge number of American
inmates are incarcerated for nothing other than drug
offenses. Furthermore, a disproportionate number of those inmates are
minorities, despite having similar rates of drug use.[..]

The War on Drugs has all but turned Mexico into a narco state. Drug
cartels gain so much power from the profits the War on Drugs has
enabled them that they have arguably become the most powerful
institutions south of the Rio Grande.

Just as Prohibition gave rise to the Mafia, drug prohibition gave rise
to the Latin American drug cartels. Al Capone and Pablo Escobar might
as well have been the same person.

Or put more simply, the War of Drugs creates crime, it doesn’t solve
it. [..]

As should be apparent, it is utopian nonsense to believe we can stop
people from buying and using drugs that are so easily
accessible. Instead, drug prohibition just creates a massive black
market, which criminal gangs control and profit from.

Furthermore, the evidence strongly suggests that legalization
works. The best example is Portugal. As a recent headline in Forbes
 noted, “Ten Years After Decriminalization, Drug Abuse Down by Half in
Portugal.” And, a report by the Brookings Institute finds that
marijuana legalization in Colorado has been “largely successful.”
