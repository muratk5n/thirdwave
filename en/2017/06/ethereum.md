# Ethereum

The Ethereum blockchain can be alternately described as a blockchain with a built-in programming language, or as a consensus-based globally executed virtual machine. The part of the protocol that actually handles internal state and computation is referred to as the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). From a practical standpoint, the EVM can be thought of as a large decentralized computer containing millions of objects, called "accounts", which have the ability to maintain an internal database, execute code and talk to each other.

V kewl.. Ethereum is another cybercurrency similar to Bitcoin, with improvements. I was reading  The Book of Satoshi the other day, and noticed S$ has been somewhat shy in including a scripting language in Bitcoin. With Ephereum scripting is central, in fact, a key piece of its architecture. They imagine applications / code, financial or otherwise running on decentralized computers (everyone's machine whose incentive for allowing processing on their machine is that they get $ in return, through mining). Smart contracts are much easier to implement. There are other programmer-friendly features too. Very cool.
