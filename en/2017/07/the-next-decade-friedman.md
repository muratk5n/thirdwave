Eurasia

The American interest in Eurasia—understood as Russia and the European
peninsula—is the same as U.S. interest everywhere: for no single power
or coalition to dominate. The unification of Russia and Europe would
create a force whose population, technological and industrial
capability, and natural resources would at the very least equal
America’s, and in all likelihood outstrip them. ...

Russia

Putin’s strategy of focusing on energy production and export is a
superb short-term tool, but it works only if it forms the basis for
major economic expansion. To achieve this larger objective, Russia has
to deal with its underlying structural weaknesses, yet these
weaknesses are rooted in geographical problems that are not readily
overcome.

Unlike much of the industrial world, Russia has both a relatively
small population for its size and a population that is highly
dispersed, tied together by little more than a security apparatus and
a common culture.

Even the major cities, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, are not the
centers of a giant megalopolis. They are stand-alone entities,
separated from each other by vast distances of farmland and
forest. Leaving apart the fact that the Russian population is in
decline, the current distribution of population makes a modern
economy, or even efficient distribution of food, difficult, if not
impossible. The infrastructure connecting farming areas to the city is
poor, as is the infrastructure connecting industrial and commercial
centers.

The problem in connectivity stems from the fact that Russia’s rivers
go the wrong way. Unlike American rivers, which connect farming
country to ports where food can be distributed, Russian rivers merely
create barriers. Neither the czars and their railway bonds nor Stalin
with his enforced starvation ever came close to overcoming the
problem, and the cost of building a connective tissue for the Russian
economy—extensive rail systems and roads—remains staggering. Russia
has always wielded a military force that outstripped its economy,

Germany

History had placed Germany on the north of the North European Plain,
an area with a few rivers to serve as defenses, but some of the most
productive parts of this new nation-state were on the opposite bank of
the Rhine, completely unprotected. To the west was France. To the east
was Russia. Both had enjoyed the centuries when Germany was fragmented
and weak, but now there was a frightening new Germany, economically
the most dynamic country in Europe, with a powerful military and with
a deep sense of insecurity.

Germany in turn was frightened by its neighbors’ fears. Germany’s
leaders knew their nation could not survive if it was attacked
simultaneously by France and Russia. They also believed that at some
point such an attack would come, because they understood how
intimidating they appeared to their neighbors. Germany could not
permit France and Russia to start a war at the time or place of their
choosing, and thus Germany, driven by its own fear, devised a strategy
of preemption coupled with alliances.

Europe in the twentieth century was defined by these fears, which,
being imposed by geography, were both rational and unavoidable [..]

Both world wars were launched according to a single scenario: Germany,
insecure because of its geographical position, swept across France in
a lightning attack. The goal in both cases was to defeat France
quickly, then deal with Russia. In 1914, the Germans failed to defeat
France quickly, the troops dug in, and the conflict became a
protracted war. The Germans found themselves fighting France, Britain,
and Russia simultaneously in both the east and the west. ...

Poland

The Poles have suffered in direct relation to the strategic importance
of their location, bordering both Germany and Russia and occupying the
North European Plain, which extends like a thoroughfare from the
French Atlantic coast to St. Petersburg. The other eastern European
countries share the Polish view, but they are geographically safer,
behind the Carpathian Mountains.

Exposed on either side, Poland will have little choice but to go along
with whatever the Germans and Russians decide, which would be
disastrous for the United States. It is therefore in the American
interest to guarantee Poland’s independence from Russia and Germany,
not only formally but by creating a viable and vibrant Polish economy
and military that can serve as the model and driver for the rest of
eastern Europe. Poland is the historical bone in the throat of both
Germany and Russia, and it is in the American interest to make sure
that it is firmly lodged there. A Poland aligned with Germany is a
threat to Russia, and the reverse is true as well. Poland must remain
a threat to both, because the United States cannot let either feel too
secure.

Over the next ten years, an American relationship with Poland would
serve two functions: it might prevent or limit the Russo-German
entente, but failing that, it could create a counterbalance. The
United States urgently needs Poland, because there is no alternative
strategy for balancing an alliance between Russia and Germany.

Australia

Australia is actually quite dependent on international trade .. These
goods are shipped by sea, and Australia has no control whatever over
the security of its sea-lanes. In a sense, then, Australia is like a
creature whose arteries and veins are located outside its body,
unprotected and constantly at risk.  Australia’s strategy for dealing
with this vulnerability has been to ally itself with the dominant
naval power in the western Pacific—once Britain, now the United
States. All alliances bear costs, and the British and Americans wanted
the same quid pro quo: Australia’s participation in their
wars. Australians sacrificed heavily in the Boer War, both world wars,
and in Korea and Vietnam. Between 1970 and 1990 the Australians pulled
back from this role as military partner, but during this period there
were few calls for their participation. In 1990, in Desert Storm, they
returned to their strategy of assisting in military operations, and
they then went on to fight in both Afghanistan and Iraq.

Along with the security of sea-lanes, Australia’s well-being depends
on an international trading regime that allows terms it can
manage. Australia’s strategy of being of service to its Anglo-American
cousins has bought it a seat at the table alongside the great
powers. This has provided influence and security to its trade,
something that Australia never could have achieved on its own.

During World War II, Australia served Britain by sending troops to
North Africa. It served the United States by acting as a depot for
building up U.S.  forces for the Pacific theater. Certainly Australian
forces fought as well, but if no forces had been available,
Australia’s tremendous value was its location, behind the geographic
shield of Indonesia and New Guinea. Should any great power emerge in
the western Pacific to challenge the United States, Australia will
once again be the strategic foundation for America’s Pacific
strategy. The caveat is that building the infrastructure for a rear
depot took several years in World War II, and any future conflict
might not allow that kind of lead time.
