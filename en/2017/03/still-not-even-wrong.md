# Still Not Even Wrong

This week results are being presented by the LHC experiments at the
Moriond (twitter here) and Aspen conferences. While these so far have
not been getting much publicity from CERN or in the media, they are
quite significant [..]  The results on searches for supersymmetry
(SUSY) reported this week have all been negative, further pushing up
the limits on possible masses of conjectured superparticles. [..] This
is now enough data near the design energy that some of the bets SUSY
enthusiasts made years ago will now have to be paid off, in particular
Lubos Motl’s bet with Adam Falkowski, and David Gross’s with Ken Lane
(see here). A major question now facing those who have spent decades
promoting SUSY extensions of the Standard Model is whether they will
accept the verdict of experiment or choose a path of denialism,
something that I think will be very damaging for the field.

M-theory bullshit keeps on resurfacing.
