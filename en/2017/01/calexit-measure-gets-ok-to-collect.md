Ha ha.. The federal thing is all nice and good, but now Buttfuckee, South Carolina is deciding immigration policy for Orange County, California. That cannot stand. Elected reps are there to balance out the local with federal, the long with the short term. If they cannot do their job, either they go or their electors do.
