# Square  + Bitcoin

Some customers of Square's Cash app have gotten a surprise in the past week.

The app, which is used for payments between friends and is a competitor to Venmo, has also given them the option to buy or sell Bitcoin.

A few rejoiced on Twitter -- probably much to the delight of Square CEO Jack Dorsey, who is also CEO of the social media site.[..]

A Square spokesperson said in a statement: “We’re always listening to our customers and we’ve found that they are interested in using the Cash App to buy Bitcoin. We're exploring how Square can make this experience faster and easier, and have rolled out this feature to a small number of Cash App customers. We believe cryptocurrency can greatly impact the ability of individuals to participate in the global financial system and we're excited to learn more here.”
