# What Does NK Want?

https://youtu.be/nD2RWXicpbM

It is now becoming clear NK wants to get from under China's thumb. US
engaged China at first (the right thing to do at the time, and it
unearthed some more knowledge), but this was exactly the opposite of
what NK wanted, naturally shit hit the fan. Un probably got this going
at this time bcz he knows curr. US admin is lukewarm against China. NK
had Un brother killed, he was under Chinese protection. The latest hyd
bomb went off right when Xi was in a summit, major black eye.

This makes more sense.
