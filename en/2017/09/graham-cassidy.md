"Section 101: Any individual who was overpaid in premium tax credits would have to repay the entire excess amount, regardless of income".

They will make people pay back if they received this "excess" amount, that'll piss them off to no end. 

On preexisting conditions: 

"States would be able to use payments allocated from the program for one or more of the following allowed activities: To establish or maintain a program or mechanism to help high-risk individuals"

The bill basically says it gives states bunch of money, they can use it to help people with preexisting conditions, GC does not make them to do so. So if a state decides not to care about preexisting conditions, it is GONE. 

I bet whole lota Rep states will not do that, states with lota Trump voters. Sup?

Meanwhile, the gears are turning..

"Not so long ago, moderate Democrats avoided single payer at all costs. Now, to use the parlance of the left, it has been "normalized." The bill, introduced last week, already has been cast as a litmus test for Democrats eyeing a White House run. And well before 2020, Democratic candidates will face pressure from the liberal flank to get behind the bill in exchange for support in the 2018 midterms."
