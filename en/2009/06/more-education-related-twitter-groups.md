While browsing through #hackedu, I came across #unschooling, #homeschool, #edupunk. I will monitor these sources as well. Oh lately there is always #iran and #iranelection and #swineflu.

I found this story under #unschooling very interesting. Teacher punishes student to write some sentence 1000 times, dad gets pissed off (who has a computer) and teaches his son BASIC language to make computer do this task repetitively with few lines of BASIC code. Industrial style punishment got SLAMMED by Third Wave solution. F!!@# you and the horse you ride in on. I say.
