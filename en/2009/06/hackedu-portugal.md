# #Hackedu Portugal

Nice article by Don Tapscott. Portugal experiment shows introducing laptops to classrooms changes the entire dynamic of education. It's not "teaching" per se, it is "coaching" others on researching. The communication is not unidirectional anymore; and, there is another teacher in the room now; The Internet.

Another report that takes the "Internet as the educator" idea further.
