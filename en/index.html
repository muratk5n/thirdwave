<p>Nikkei Asia: "Japan and the European Union will work together on
setting international standards for the hydrogen supply chain, in a
bid to take the lead in shaping a new market, Nikkei has learned. The
rules would cover such areas as technologies for producing and
transporting the fuel.</p>
<p>Japan's minister for economy, trade and industry, Ken Saito, and Kadri
Simson, the European commissioner for energy, will agree in an
upcoming meeting to create a joint road map for hydrogen usage through
2040"</p>
<hr />
<p>SCMP: "Start-up CM Xiageng Hydrogen Energy Technology, a green
hydrogen equipment maker backed by the Fujian government and
conglomerate China Merchants Group, plans to quadruple its output. It
is rushing to feed a global market which is growing at a searing pace
of 40.7 per cent annually.. It will soon launch fund raising plans to
finance this expansion at a time when China’s installed green hydrogen
electrolyser capacity is expected to grow to over 40GW by 2025 from
last year’s 11.5GW"</p>

<p>The Atlantic: "AI travel plans leave something to be desired. When I
told ChatGPT that I was a 'huge foodie' and asked it to adjust an
L.A. itinerary accordingly, it suggested I go to a Michelin-starred
restaurant for dinner. It didn’t say which one. It just told me that
L.A. had some and that, if I liked food, I should go to one. That’s
sort of like telling a person who likes music that maybe they’d be
into a Grammy-winning artist and leaving it at that...</p>
<p>[A] team of researchers at Fudan University in Shanghai, Ohio State
University, Penn State, and Meta came to a similar conclusion. They
tested chatbots on 1,000 sample queries, such as 'Please create a
travel itinerary for a solo traveler departing from Jacksonville and
heading to Los Angeles for a period of 3 days, from March 25th to
March 27th, 2022. The budget for this trip is now set at $2,400.' They
then evaluated whether the chatbots were able to provide answers that
met all the criteria in the prompt. The chatbots pretty much failed
across the board. [Even the best] successfully answered only six
queries out of 1,000, or 0.6 percent. The chatbots failed for a
variety of factors: They made reasoning errors, and sometimes made
stuff up"</p>

<p>NPU means Neural Processing Unit, so the machine runs "AI" locally,
wout going out to the cloud. But I dont think one dinky little
"neural" processing unit will allow you to run any of these recent
LLMs locally. It is unclear such an ability would be desired
either. LLMs are useless for any serious real-world need.</p>
<p>Biztech Mag: "Both the [Microsoft] Surface Pro 10 and the Surface
Laptop 6 feature an NPU"</p>
<hr />
<p>At least 30 GIGABYTES. This is just to <em>use</em> the model btw, training
it will take 10-30x more resources.</p>
<p>"Compute resources used for [ChatGPT] inference: the model must be
fully loaded into vram to compute the recursive seq2seq response (it
can be anything between 30gb to 200gb depending on the architecture
and number of parameters of the model)"</p>

<p>Stanford: "Vaporware: One practice that has been associated with
Microsoft, and has subsequently been investigated by the Department of
Justice, is Microsoft's practice of releasing 'vaporware'. Vaporware
is considered an unfair marketing technique - it often allows a
company that already has considerable market share in one area to
claim similar market share in another area without even distributing a
product. The enthusiasm for the anticipated release of the product is
often enough to squelch any market competition, even though there is
no product to compete"</p>
<hr />
<p>Vaporwave is a good-ol' Silicon Valley practice, Microshaft was the
master at it back in the day.</p>
