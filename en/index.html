<p>Masse: "Two Slits Open for a Single Photon.. In such an experiment, a
single photon from the light source will still be incident on both
slits in the aperture screen at the same time, and will produce two
coherent sinusoidal wavelets that interfere constructively and
destructively.  Each of these sinusoidal wavelets will have less
energy than a photon of the same frequency, and so the wavelets will
not be photons. Moreover, the energy of the two sinusoidal wavelets
will generally not be equal.</p>
<p>When the sinusoidal wavelets reach the image screen, the destructively
interfering parts of the sinusoidal wavelets will have significantly
less energy than a photon of the same frequency, and so will be unable
to produce an observable photographic or photoelectric effect. Dark
fringes will result.  Only the constructively interfering parts of the
sinusoidal wavelets will have sufficient energy (approximately the
energy of a photon of the same frequency) to produce an observable
photographic or photoelectric effect that will contribute to forming
bright fringes on the image screen. Moreover, a constructively
interfering part of the sinusoidal wavelet must strike an atom on the
image screen just right to provide sufficient energy for the atom to
change state and eject a single electron.</p>
<p>Out of hundreds of interfering parts of the two wavelets, only one
pair will generally produce any observable effect. This effect will
usually be isolated to a single atom on the image screen. Therefore,
the constructively interfering wavelets will appear to be very
localized (at a point) similar to a single particle striking the image
screen. Nevertheless, the change occurring in an atom of the image
screen in a low-intensity experiment is due to constructively
interfering sinusoidal wavelets; not to a particle"</p>
<hr />
<p>Masse says light is a wave, not wave and particle at the same time.
People who keep looking for magical funkiness in QM forget basic facts
about waves, they have to lose energy when they pass through the slits
and split, the two new waves are syncronized but have different travel
times towards the screen, therefore they can interfere with each other
constructively or destructively. And since the two waves have less
energy only perfect contructive interference will result in a bright
image on the screen. In a single photon two-slit experiment that can
give the impression of a "particle" traveling both slits. The
explanation can really be that simple. You have to be dumber to look
for something more complex and "magical".</p>

<p>RU's supposed involvement in that case is wholly debunked. But I bet
some fools still believe it. You know the type, blue-no-matter-who

government ties.. Nick Shapiro [was] the CIAâ€™s former deputy chief of
staff and senior advisor to former director John Brennan... Shapiro is
not without controversy. He was one of a group of 51 former senior
intelligence officials who signed the widely cited and subsequently
criticized 2020 open letter stating that the Hunter Biden laptop 'has
all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation'"</p>

<p>News 12: "Hoboken passes new ordinance concerning lithium-ion battery
storage..  These new rules directly target owners of e-bikes and
scooters... but the batteries can also be a major fire
hazard...[Official] explained this new ordinance pertains to the
storage of batteries within a property housing three or more
units. Starting March 11, it will be illegal to charge a lithium-ion
battery in a common area. This includes no basements, lobbies or
hallways... In New York City, the FDNY says lithium-ion batteries
caused 277 fires in 2024"</p>

<p>"Hybritâ€™s pilot project for hydrogen gas storage has now been
completed and reported to the Swedish Energy Agency. The results show
that it is technically possible to store fossil-free hydrogen gas for
producing fossil-free iron and steel on an industrial scale. This can
also reduce the variable operating costs of hydrogen production by up
to 40 per cent"</p>

<p>I never said there are no deep state structures in other countries. I
said <em>US</em> doesn't have one.</p>

<p>I feel sorry for people whose homeworks were truly eaten by a dog.
You can tell what happened but now noone would believe you.</p>
<hr />
<p>ðŸ˜‚ This deep state business is the new "the dog ate my homework".</p>
<p>The Independent: "[T]he [Epstein] files failed to yield major new
findings and featured some information that was already public.
[Loomer] wrote '1 week ago, @PamBondi said â€œthe Epstein files are on
my desk'. Now sheâ€™s claiming the 'deep state' set her up.</p>

<p>I do not have knee-jerk reaction to all coins. I heard good things
about Cardano.</p>
<p>A fast, minimal energy crypto with redistribution features built-in
can be a useful future currency.</p>
<hr />
<p>If US backs these coins, their liquidity will increase, helping them
become international currencies on par with USD. The difference is
said coins are not strictly controlled by US, so their promotion will
help foreign countries to transact, bypassing US. Russia will benefit.
The announcement is made after a public spat involving
Russia. Coincidence?</p>
