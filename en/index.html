<p>Politico: "The nation‚Äôs housing affordability crisis has become so
acute that even our presidential candidates are paying attention to
it...</p>
<p>But the number of‚ÄØ housing units in the nation has grown faster than
the number of‚ÄØhouseholds since the turn of the century. Something else
is happening here.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs because demand for real estate is not just about the number of
people who need homes, it‚Äôs also about the amount of money buyers are
bringing into the market. People without money cannot push up
prices. It‚Äôs the people with money ‚Äî especially those with a lot of
money ‚Äî who drive up prices for everyone else"</p>

<p>Schahill, <em>Blackwater</em>: "[Naomi] Klein, who traveled to Iraq during
Bremer's tenure in the country and has written extensively on his
rule, described the effects of his edict-based governance as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Bremer] enacted a radical set of laws unprecedented in their
generosity to multinational corporations. There was Order 37, which
lowered Iraq's corporate tax rate from roughly 40 percent to a flat 15
percent. There was Order 39, which allowed foreign companies to own
100 percent of Iraqi assets outside of the natural-resource
sector. Even better, investors could take 100 percent of the profits
they made in Iraq out of the country; they would not be required to
reinvest and they would not be taxed. Under Order 39, they could sign
leases and contracts that would last for forty years. Order 40
welcomed foreign banks to Iraq under the same favorable terms. All
that remained of Saddam Hussein's economic policies was a law
restricting trade unions and collective bargaining...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems appropriate, then, that Bremer, the senior U.S. official in
Iraq, the public face of the occupation, would not be protected by
U.S. government forces or Iraqi security but rather by a private
mercenary company"</p>

execution of a lot of high-ranking officials in the Iranian military,

<p>Modern technology is great. A rich guy will be like 'our new
innovation is an app for ignoring the regulations around something
that already exists. This will let everyone make money via a sort of
petty landlordism'</p>
<p>Then they burn heaps of investor money for like a year while people
start to depend on it because they undercut everything else, then they
just take all the money that the gig workers had been making and turn
those petit landlords back into serfs"</p>

<p>Looks like the @unituebingen won't continue its #Matlab license due
to the high cost and lack of state partners to share the financial
load.</p>

elsewhere. Teach students #Python, #Rstats et al., not some weird
proprietary software they can't use freely afterwards.</p>

<p>Let's note the situation is not one of ISR shoots at Hezbollah but
hits UN who are also in the area. No. ISR wants UN out of there, so
they shoot directly at UNIFIL soldiers, to force them out.</p>

<p>Hassan Jouni: "[Israel] wants the fighting space to be open to the
Israeli military.. UNIFIL forces [in Lebanon] hold important and
sensitive positions they could hinder the process of the Israeli
military. If they withdraw, these positions could see heavy clashes
between the Israeli army and Hezbollah"</p>
