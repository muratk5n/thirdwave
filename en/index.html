<p>The Urbanist: "[King County] Metro Adding Hydrogen Buses, Auditor
Casts Doubt on Fleet Electrification Strategy.. One reason why Metro
is pursuing fuel cell buses boils down to operational needs and
constraints. “While battery-electric buses have an expected range of
140 miles for a 60-foot bus and 220 miles for a 40-foot bus, Metro and
other transit agencies have experienced range limitations and
variability, especially in cold weather,” the agency wrote in a blog
post. 'Hydrogen fuel cell buses have the potential to travel up to 300
miles and their extended range has particular promise on all-day,
frequent routes.'"</p>

<p>Golden rule of government spending: why have one enemy when you can
have two for twice the cost? With two enemies instead of one you get
twice the profit for military contractors, twice the amount of
kickbacks gov officials receive from those companies, twice the
corruption, and twice the number of people who go through the
revolving doors. It is a "no-brainer" to use a common phrase popular
in the Clinton administration.</p>
<hr />
<p>Host: "It is said that somewhere in the middle of the 1990s during the
Clinton Administration there was a shift in American foreign policy in
the Middle East from balancing Iran and Iraq, to double containment of
Iran and Iraq.. [Was this] policy shift towards double containment
primarily because of Israel's instigation?"</p>
<p>Ambassador Chas Freeman: "Yes I think that's the case. I was at the
Defense Department at the time, this policy was suddenly imposed on us
by a political appointee, Martin Indyk, actually who had been an
Israeli Citizen and was naturalized one day before taking up his
responsibilities in the National Security Council staff. It was very
hard for me or others in the region to see what benefit we would get
from a policy that is fatiguing expensive and consumes a lot of
resources.. therefore one has to assume that this was contrived for
the benefit of Israel"</p>

terror group as currently unattainable, appearing to further
underscore tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and top
defense officials over his handling of the war in Gaza.. 'This
business of destroying Hamas, making Hamas disappear — it’s simply
throwing sand in the eyes of the public,' Hagari told Channel 13 news
in an interview"</p>
