<p>Thomas Frank, <em>New York Times</em>: "The Elites Had It Coming..  At the
Republican convention in July, JD Vance described the ruination
visited on his working-class town in Ohio by NAFTA and trade with
China, both of which he blamed at least in part on Mr. Biden, and also
the human toll taken by the Iraq war, which he also contrived to blame
on Mr. Biden. Today Mr. Vance is the vice president-elect, and what I
hope you will understand, what I want you to mull over and take to
heart and remember for the rest of your life, is that he got there by
mimicking the language that Americans used to associate with labor,
with liberals, with Democrats..</p>
<p>A party of the left that identifies with people like Mr. Cheney is a
contradiction in terms, a walking corpse..</p>
<p>I have begun to doubt that any combination of financial disaster or
electoral chastisement will ever turn on the lightbulb for the
liberals. I fear that 90s-style centrism will march on, by a
sociological force of its own, until the parties have entirely
switched their social positions and the world is given over to
Trumpism. Can anything reverse it? Only a resolute determination by
the Democratic Party to rededicate itself to the majoritarian vision
of old: a Great Society of broad, inclusive prosperity. This means
universal health care and a higher minimum wage. It means robust
financial regulation and antitrust enforcement. It means unions and a
welfare state and higher taxes on billionaires, even the cool ones. It
means, above all, liberalism as a social movement, as a coming
together of ordinary people"</p>

<p>Matthew Hass, UCCS: "Somewhere between the end of 2000 and mid
2001.. Goldman Sachs (GS), facilitated several intricate transactions
with Greece. These transactions employed trading methods utilizing
elaborate financial derivatives (particularly security swaps) with the
purpose of concealing Greek national debt. The Hellenic Republic of
Greece was the newest member of the Eurozone at the time.</p>
<p>In order to remain in the European Union (EU), a nation must meet and
uphold financial policies per the Maastricht Treaty. The two limits
imposed on government finances were the following: '3% for the ratio
of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product
[GDP] at market prices,' and '60% for the ratio of [total] government
debt to gross domestic product [GDP] at market prices'.. In an effort
to hide Greece’s swelling public debt from EU regulators (in 2009 debt
to GDP ratio was 130%), Goldman Sachs implemented over-the-counter
(OTC) trades—private trades occurring outside any regulated securities
exchange. These trades involved exchanges of derivative contracts
(swaps) between GS and Greece. In short, Goldman Sachs succeeded in
avoiding EU scrutiny by giving Greece an off-the-books loan.</p>
<p>Greece’s publicly reported deficit/debt ratios were artificially
reduced in 2001 by effectively issuing the country an upfront
‘cash-advance,’ through the use of cleverly crafted swaps by Goldman
Sachs, at a time when such a ‘loan’ was not required by Eurostat to be
reported as a liability. Therefore, the unconventional pseudo-loan was
not only kept off the public books, it was also explicitly used to
write-down the existing sovereign debt load as though the funds were
in fact surplus government revenue..</p>
<p>Since these swaps and loans were kept off the books, no higher entity
could crosscheck the methods or numbers used by Goldman Sachs. The
swaps implemented were cross-currency swaps (CCSs) which GS
specifically engineered with fictitious exchange rates. This gave the
deal a lure of profitability and a guise of stability to the Hellenic
Republic.</p>
<p>These tactics may have given Greece the appearance of an improving
financial position (required by the Maastricht Treaty for membership
in the Eurozone), but they essentially created a house of cards that
could only stand for so long"</p>

<p>The key lesson here is if a party bases its votes on a numerous group,
it increases their staying power. DJT lost in 2020 but did not lose
<em>badly</em>. His connection to the working class helped avert a bigger
loss which he subsequently used for his 2024 win.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ruffini, <em>Party of the People</em>, 2023: "It needs to be repeated that
Trump lost the 2020 election. Neither his gains in key groups nor his
false narratives about a stolen election change this fact. But Trump’s
performance was testament to the resiliency of a Republican coalition
built around the working-class voter, which in 2020 had grown to
include more nonwhite voters. The rise of multiracial working-class
conservatism, once on track to merit but a small footnote in the story
of a landslide Trump defeat, instead became a crucial reason why the
election was so close. For Republicans, this proved to be both a
blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it sketched out a future road
map to winning over diverse nonwhite voters on the same terms that it
had won over white working-class voters. On the other hand, the
closeness of the result gave Trump little reason to leave the stage,
his presence clouding Republican prospects in the 2022 midterms—and
the 2024 presidential race"</p>
