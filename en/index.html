<p>[A]fter the war the allies pretty much imposed the 'Mitbestimmung'
system (worker participation in management) on German industry -
because it was clear that inequality, exploitation and social division
had led to fascism, war, holocaust - but bizarrely failed to adopt it
themselves, even when it became clear it was working better than their
own systems"</p>
<hr />
<p>Monbiot, The Guardian: "Things are not going to get better as long as
oligarchs rule the roost in our democracies.. [Some post-WWII
beneficial] politics were the result of something known to economic
historians as the 'great compression': a drastic reduction in
inequality caused by two world wars. In many powerful countries, a
combination of the physical destruction of assets, the loss of
colonial and overseas possessions, inflation, very high taxes, wage
and price controls, requisitioning and nationalisation required by the
wartime economy, as well as the effects of rising democracy and labour
organisation, greatly reduced the income and assets of the rich. It
also greatly improved, once the wars had ended, the position of the
poor...</p>
<p>[Scheidel] shows how warfare economies have been turned into welfare
economies... For example, following the defeat of Japan, the US
occupation government, led by General Douglas MacArthur, sought what
it called 'the democratization of Japanese economic institutions' to
ensure 'a wide distribution of income and ownership of the means of
production and trade'. To this end, it imposed high property taxes,
with a top marginal rate of 90%; broke up business conglomerates;
demanded a labour union law enabling the right to organise and strike,
and higher wages for workers; organised comprehensive land reform,
which dissolved large holdings and distributed them to peasants; and
introduced fiscal reform that led eventually to taxes on the highest
incomes of 75% and an inheritance tax on the largest estates of
70%. These programmes resulted in the near-total destruction of income
from capital and the creation in Japan of a political and economic
democracy, almost from scratch"</p>
<hr />
<p>Business Insider: "Denver gave people experiencing homelessness $1,000
a month. A year later, nearly half of participants had housing"</p>
<hr />
<p>Homelessness is a direct result of inequality, overpriced assets due to
asset hoarding by corporations and the rich.</p>
<p>However from a regular city dweller POV, the encampments are on public
space that are open to all, but permanent structures on it, however
shoddy, deny others that public space. It's like encampments create
little privatized spaces plundered from the citizenry, for free. The
SCOTUS decision is fine from that angle, long-term fixes on
inequality, and near term help for homeless with public housing would
be good too.</p>

<p>BBC: "US Supreme Court allows cities to ban homeless camps"</p>

<p>WRMEA: "[2022/11] AIPAC Election Role Raises Question of Foreign Agent
Registration.. For the first time, the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC) formed two [PACs] which have set records in their
contributions to candidates in primary election campaigns this year...</p>
<p>AIPAC also launched a super PAC [UDP]..  which initially did not
include any mention of Israel in its 'About Us' statement. As a super
PAC, UDP can accept unlimited donations, but it must disclose its
donors. It cannot fund candidates directly, but it can spend unlimited
amounts advocating for or against candidates. UDP was the biggest
spending political action committee during the primaries and dispensed
more than $24.2 million in support of its favored candidates. Out of
eight candidates backed by UDP, six won their primaries..</p>
<p>Going back to the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration repeatedly
insisted that the American Zionist Council (AZC) register as 'agents
of a foreign government'..</p>
<p>[In his book Grant F. Smith] writes: 'Not until the early 1960s would
the Senate begin to investigate whether U.S. aid sent overseas and
other funds were being secretly laundered back into the U.S. to obtain
political influence and additional foreign aid. In 1963, a close
analysis of [AZC official] I. L. Kenen’s financing revealed that this
was indeed happening'..  The Senate hearings documented the fact that
in the early 1960s, Israel funneled $5 million (more than 35 million
in today’s dollars) into U.S. propaganda and lobbying operations"</p>
