<p>Philips: "[2002 W]hen I published <em>The Politics of Rich and Poor</em>,
some of its success was owed to the two lead endorsements on the back
of the book jacket. One was from New York Governor Mario Cuomo, then
widely expected to be the 1992 Democratic presidential nominee. The
second was from former President Richard Nixon, who gave it with full
knowledge that the book was critical of the Reagan and Bush
administrations for favoring the rich. Nixon’s streetcar-worker father
had left Ohio for California after getting a name as labor agitator,
and he thereafter interrupted his McKinley Republicanism to support
third-party progressives like Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and Robert La
Follette in 1924. As president, Nixon himself supported national
health insurance, income maintenance for the poor, and higher taxation
of unearned than earned income. The 1972 Republican platform actually
criticized multinational corporations for building plants overseas to
take advantage of cheap labor"</p>
