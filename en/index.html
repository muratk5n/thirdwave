<p>Stephen Gruyère is being let go? I don't think Gruyère is fired for
being not funny, he has been not funny for a while now and they still
kept him. But he platformed Mamdani, that could've triggered his
firing.. In corporate mindset he exercised the ultimate sin - gave the
enemy a chance.</p>

<p>The Lever: "So much for preventing government waste. After months of
warnings from federal workers were ignored, 500 metric tons worth of
emergency, high-nutrition biscuits intended for global disaster relief
are instead marked for incineration, The Atlantic reports. Thanks to
the Department of Government Efficiency, which all but eliminated the
U.S. Agency for International Development, routine foreign aid
expenses — including deliveries — now require approval from the very
top. Yet employees’ requests to distribute the biscuits were ignored,
and now they're nearing expiration, leading the Trump administration
to order their incineration."</p>

<p>"ZeroAvia scores 45 fresh patents for hydrogen aviation
engines.. Aviation startup ZeroAvia says it’s been granted a “raft” of
45 new patents key to the development of practical large hydrogen
aviation engines – and the company says it has 200 more H-related
patents in the pipeline!</p>
<p>The news comes just weeks after ZeroAvia and Scottish regional airline
Loganair announced a new, hydrogen-electric “turboprop” replacement
motor capable of up to 5MW of shaft horsepower (~6,700 hp). United
States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) no. 12,341,225 covers an
integrated hydrogen-electric engine design land is key to the
development of a modular multi-MW hydrogen-electric engine for the ATR
42 and 72 model aircraft — which Loganair owns more than twenty of."</p>

<p>The Lever: "Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces across the country
are projected to see the largest rate hikes in more than five years,
driving up out-of-pocket premiums for individual plan policyholders by
more than 75 percent on average, according to data compiled by the
Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 21 million Americans who don’t
have employer-sponsored health insurance rely on the ACA marketplace
for coverage."</p>
