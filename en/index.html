<p>By the time of the second Watergate break-in, Nixon knew he would be
running against McGovern, an easy candidate to beat. Why would he spy
on the DNC to supposedly ensure his re-election?</p>
<p>The money found on the burglars were too easy to trace back to the
Nixon campaign. Raises a red flag, looks suspicious. Did someone want
that connection to be made?</p>
<p>Note Woodward started to use a key confidential source while the
Soviet détente and opening to China were taking place, it is as if the
source, who was unhappy with those events, wanted to prep a
relationship with a journalist before "the big event started"
(Watergate), so he could continue using this journalist to leak
further info in the future.</p>

<p>It's clear why affordability went down after covid; money infusion
went from people to the rich creating more inequality, the wealthy

is redistribution of wealth.</p>

its lowest level in at least 17 years, having swung dramatically from
record levels of affordability during the early stages of the COVID

<p>One viewpoint blames Germany and Austria-Hungary but France-Russia had
their own worries to partake in a war. A-H had annexed Bosnia, which
angered Serbia whose big daddy was, as it is now, Russia who wanted
access to the seas. The Balkan Wars were likely
<a href="https://youtu.be/9KESpCFmYMk?t=277">encouraged</a> by Russians, Serbia
ended up with more territory w Ottomans losing it, and Serbian
nationalistic dislike against A-H never went away. Basically the
Balkans were contested territory for the empires, who were by now
armed to the teeth and with new industrialised mobilization techniques
were afraid if you did not mobilize first you would lose. And everyone
feared the rising power Germany. The perfect storm.</p>

<p>US is closer to a McDonalds franchise rather than an empire; bases
instead of restaurants, Himars instead of Mac'n'cheese. Not much
thought is given to the expansion process, except a general idea where
the next batch of profits will come from, or expands usually for the
sake of expanding, like McDonalds.. A new restaurant/base in the
Balkans, Africa, why not? Would you like fries with that?</p>

<p>Another thing that US pundits get wrong about EU antitrust action: the
EU doesn't tell companies <em>how</em> to comply, the companies propose
solutions and the EU tells them <em>if</em> it complies. They don't design
your products for you. If a company goes for a browser ballot, say,
it's because that's what it wants to do, not because the EU is making
them do it that way"</p>

<p>Catholic Herald: "[03/01] Pope talks of ‘courage to negotiate’ to end
war in Ukraine.. Pope has said he believes 'the strongest one is the
one who looks at the situation, thinks about the people and has the
courage of the white flag, and negotiates.. there is always some
geographical or historical situation that causes a war but behind a
war, there is the arms industry, and this means money'"</p>

<p>Hossein-Zadeh: "It does not follow.. as some critics argue, the
U.S.–Israeli relationship represents a case of 'tail wagging the dog,'
that is, the U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East is shaped by the
Israeli/Zionist leaders. Nor do I subscribe to the hoary anti-Semitic
canards that are used to put forth a specious case for Jews trying to
run the world. While, no doubt, the powerful Jewish lobby exerts
considerable influence over U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East,
the efficacy and the extent of that influence depend, ultimately, on
the real economic and geopolitical interests of U.S. foreign policy
makers. In other words, U.S. policy makers in the Middle East would go
along with the demands of the radical Zionist lobby only if such
demands also tend to serve the special interests that those policy
makers represent or serve—not necessarily the interests of the
American people, or collective U.S. 'national interests' in
general. The fact that, as pointed out earlier, U.S. foreign policy
during the Cold War era was less accommodating to the territorial
desires of militant Zionism than in the post–Cold War period is an
indication of this point. Another corroborating indication of the
point is that as the military-industrial complex has been gaining more
and more influence over U.S. foreign policy, that policy has,
accordingly, been more and more geared to the wishes of hard-line
Zionism because, as has been frequently pointed out in this chapter,
the interests of the U.S.  military establishment converge with those
of militant Zionism over war and political convulsion in the Middle
East"</p>
