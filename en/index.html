<p>"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Earth’s lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.</p>
<p>Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"</p>

<p>Marche, <em>The Next Civil War</em>: "You know the problem of inequality is
serious when rich people have started to worry that they’re too
rich. In the United States, the wealthiest of the ultrawealthy, the
kind who wouldn’t notice $10 million one way or another, are forming
political action committees opposed to the concentration of wealth in
their own hands. The Patriotic Millionaires formed in 2010 with two
extraordinary goals: to lobby politicians to increase their taxes, and
to explain to ordinary Americans how unjust the economic order is. Two
of the richest men in the world, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, have
publicly called on the government to raise their tax rates. 'I have a
message for my fellow filthy rich, for all of us who live in our gated
bubble worlds,' warned early Amazon investor Nick Hanauer in
2014. 'Wake up, people. It won’t last.' He couldn’t be more right. The
Koch brothers have recently shifted their charitable endeavors from
libertarian politics to the problem that the new generation will be
worse off than the old.</p>
<p>The rich know what historians know: every society in human history
with levels of inequality like those in the United States today has
descended into war, revolution, or plague. No exceptions. There are
precisely zero historical precedents that don’t end in
destruction. Since 1980, inequality has been growing globally, but in
the United States the growth is most dramatic. In 2015, the top 1
percent of American families made 26.3 times what the 99 percent did,
garnering 22 percent of all income—the highest share since the peak of
23.9 percent before the Great Depression. In 1965, a CEO made roughly
twenty times the typical worker’s pay.  Now it’s 271 times. From 1980
on, the poorest 50 percent of the population has consistently seen a
decline in their share of income. American inequality is now worse
than it was in 1774"</p>

<p>Europe to the rescue..  They could be the antidote to crass Anglo
capitalism.</p>

<p>In light of US tech oligarchy setting its sights on Wikimedia
Foundation, a historical detail I did not know before: #Wikipedia
became the non-profit it is today partly as the result of a labour
strike of Spanish Wikipedia editors who disagreed with the proposed
inclusion of advertisements. Initially, it was not clear what revenue
model Wikipedia would get, and Wales moved towards a for-profit model
already a year after launch. However, rather than working for free, so
Jimmy Wales could profit from their labour via advertising, Spanish
contributors forked Spanish Wikipedia as the Encyclopedia Libre
Universal. Under the threat of losing the editorial community of such
a large language, Wales conceded and set up the non-profit"</p>

<p>Based on all the previous info, everything needed for the law of
centripetal force is there, $m,r,v$, plug those reverse engineer Sun's
mass, and density. That result ain't the mass of plasma. </p>
<hr />
<p>But then how far is Earth from the Moon in kilometers? Again DIY old
school, time the lunar eclipse, and form a relation with the variables
seen <a href="https://physicsteacher.blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/screenshot-2021-05-31-at-11.51.45.png?w=640">here</a>.
Aristrarchus did that 270 BC and got a pretty close answer.</p>
<hr />
<p>The article on Sun's density required prev knowledge of Sun-Earth
distance, how to DIY know that from first principles based on basic
measurements? This was doable even in ancient times, when it's half-moon
we know the 2D <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/AristarchusHalfLitMoon2.png">placement</a>.
There is a right triangle, measure $\varphi$ w/ basic instruments,
it's like 87 degrees, cosine is $L/S$, reverse that,</p>
<pre><code class="python">np.round(1./np.cos(np.deg2rad(87)),2)

<p>The Sun is roughly 19 times further to Earth than the Moon.</p>

<p>Note "the reduction in the velocity of light" statement - with the
scheme below the speed of light is variable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Puthoff: "Textbook presentations treat General Relativity (GR) in
terms of tensor formulations in curved space-time.. One [different]
approach that has a long history in GR studies.. is what can be called
the polarizable-vacuum (PV) representation of GR. Introduced by Wilson
and developed further by Dicke, the PV approach treats metric changes
in terms of equivalent changes in the permittivity and permeability
constants of the vacuum, $\epsilon_o$ and $\mu_o$..</p>
<p>In brief, Maxwell's equations in curved space are treated in the
isomorphism of a polarizable medium of variable refractive index in
flat space; the bending of a light ray near a massive body is modeled
as due to an induced spatial variation in the refractive index of the
vacuum near the body; the GR reduction in the velocity of light in a
gravitational potential as compared to a flat-space reference frame at
infinity is represented by an effective increase in the refractive
index of the vacuum, and so forth"</p>
