<p>The Japan Times: "Japan’s biggest utility, JERA, is looking to invest
in low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia projects in the Middle East, in
addition to buying their output.</p>
<p>JERA has established a division for investing in such plants. Tsuyoshi
Oyama, who heads the unit’s Australia and Middle East activities, said
facilities that can produce around 1 million tons a year of "blue”
ammonia are attractive targets, as well as smaller "green” hydrogen
projects"</p>

<p>WION: "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has initiated an
investigation into claims made by the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) regarding alleged
retaliation by Boeing against two engineers in 2022. According to
Reuters, the union maintains that the engineers, who advocated for a
re-evaluation of previous engineering work on Boeing 777 and 787 jets,
faced negative consequences from the company following the incident"</p>

<p>CBS News: "Why Teslas and other electric vehicles have problems in
cold weather..  As cold weather sweeps across the U.S., some electric
vehicle owners are learning a bitter truth: Low temperatures can stop
the cars dead in their icy tracks. The issue crystallized this week
when some Tesla owners in Chicago discovered their EVs' batteries had
died in sub-zero temperatures"</p>

<p>Car Expert: "My local Servo.. has eight liquid fuel pumps and they can
all be used simultaneously. The number of pumps is not a random choice
at any Servo that number of pumps is there because eight pumps in this
case is the number that best services the peak demand. Let us do a
thought experiment.. transition to Electric Utopia where the eight
pumps are now eight rechargers all capable of pumping 50 kwatt hours
into 8 EVS in just 5 minutes [an impossibility on its own]
Hallelujah.. what could possibly go wrong? I'd suggest here's what
could go wrong: that's 400 kwatt hours of energy in 5 minutes, think
about that another way it's 400 kwatt hours delivered in 1/12th of an
hour which is uh 5 megawatt, more or less, to run one shitty little
suburban servo. Imagine rolling that out nationally to every
station.. [it] is just a Preposterous infrastructure challenge"</p>

<p>Third party candidate, a person who did not like either party, by
definition, would take from both equally. RF could take more from DJT
than JB though.. He panders to MAGA and Dems dislike him the way they
dislike Trump.</p>
