<p>Author Michael Easter says along with long-distance travel carrying is
also a fundamental human skill. The human body is built the way it is
so that "we could slowly but surely run down prey for miles and miles
in the heat until the animal toppled over from exhaustion". Then we‚Äôd
hunt it and carry it back to camp. This is why we have two legs, sweat
glands across our body, no fur, short torsos, and strong grips. IOW
rucking is cool. Be a rucker, not a mucker.</p>

<p><em>Road House</em>, not bad, but i understand why it's theatre release was
canceled (there was some drama there w/ director crying
foul).. Entertaining enough, not that grand. McGregor has zero
presence. He constantly looks like he is doing a Cornholio imitation
wout the overhead shirt. The reveal lacked oomph. 3.5 out of 5.</p>

<p>This is how Microsoft survives. Monopoly rents on margins that are
only possible because your core good is non-rival and
non-exclusive. The fundamental problem with generative models is that
they are 10x too expensive to work with the industry‚Äôs default
business models and structure"</p>

<p>"@baldur@toot.cafe</p>
<p>Tech punditry keeps harping on the notion that nobody has ever
successfully banned 'scientific progress', but LLMs and generative
models are not 'progress'. They‚Äôre products and we ban those all the
time"</p>

<p>Nick Bano: "[The root of a lot of the high rent problems] goes back to
Margaret Thatcher and to Tony Blair because of course while it's right
to point out that Thatcher dismantled rent controls what kept the
landlords in check for most of the 20th century was that they were
scared that whenever the Tories were generous to landlords Labor would
come and turn it around again. When you have a long-term investment
like land that tended to keep the landlords at Bay a bit. So when Tony
Blair said rent controls are never coming back "I'm keeping what that
Thatcher had", that signals to the landlords to go wild"</p>

<p>Third way (not to be confused with third wave) was a faux philophical
cover for the left to act like right-wingers under a slick new
label. It was an unplanned, clumsy mess and along with the problem
leaving huge swaths of ideological spectrum unattended it naturally
caused chaos, and in the long-term (today) misery. But since the
proponents who pushed this ideology were also creating crises at the
same time they could conveniently look like heroes fighting them with
their half-assed band-aid solutions. The approach was ineffective, but
during the post Berlin Wall euphoria many did not care, mostly
chalking up the problems to the birth pangs of something new. It was
nothing new, it was something old. Rich getting richer poor getting
poorer.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Nation: "British Prime Minister Tony Blair euphorically announced
[90s], third-way thinking was.. [a] governing philosophy for the
future... The third way.. proved instrumental to another key post‚ÄìCold
War undertaking: discrediting and marginalizing movement-based
coalitions on the left, stigmatizing them as holdovers from the
recently resolved‚Äîin capitalism‚Äôs favor‚Äîpostwar clash of
ideologies. In many ways, the most lasting legacy of the third way may
well be its determination to consign the political left to the dustbin
of history, setting the stage for the new millennial age of reaction
and crisis"</p>

<p>For one transgression they blockaded Greece? Those were the days. Now
they would give Greece more weapons.</p>
<p>Unherd: "In 1847 David Pacifico, a British subject resident in Athens,
had his home stormed by a mob... As that happened, the Athenian police
did nothing. Pacifico immediately wrote to the British authorities in
Greece to explain what had taken place. In turn they approached the
Greek government asking Pacifico to be compensated. Athens refused to
do anything ‚Äî twice. As a result Lord Palmerston, then Foreign
Secretary, instructed Sir William Parker, Commander-in-Chief of the
Mediterranean Fleet, to impose a blockade of Athens and requisition
the country‚Äôs navy"</p>
