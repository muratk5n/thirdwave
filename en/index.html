It looks like a good bill.. It currently appears stalled though.</p>

<p>NYT: "Democrats in Congress have introduced a bill in both houses of

<p>BTW according to a theory, Watergate was part of what some call a
"Camelot conspiracy", the Kennedys were behind the whole
thing. Matthews talks about in the book how Ted Ken used the
opportunity to damage Nixon as a member of the Judiciary Commitee,
perhaps there was more going on behind the scenes as well. The
military-industrial complex liked JFK anyway who constantly raised
their budget, an MIC/Camelot effort would not be outside the realm of
possibility.</p>
<hr />
<p>Previous Watergate <a href="2024/03/watergate-timeline.html">timeline</a> used
some material, data from Chris Matthews' book on the subject, <em>Kennedy
&amp; Nixon</em>.</p>

<p>Have you tried @organicmaps.. A.. privacy-focused and offline
navigation app. The app features no location tracking and no data
collection. The map data is downloaded to the phone so search,
routing, and navigation can operate without a cell phone signal, ideal
for travel to locations with poor connections (hikes, remote
roads). Organic Maps uses map data from OpenStreetMap. The app is free
and open-source software"</p>

<p>Note AMZN did not use "AI" for the service, it was bunch of people

<p>Gizmodo: "Amazon Ditches 'Just Walk Out' Checkouts at Its Grocery
Stores.. Amazon Fresh is moving away from a feature of its grocery
stores where customers could skip checkout altogether. Though it
seemed completely automated, Just Walk Out relied on more than 1,000
people in India watching and labeling videos to ensure accurate
checkouts. The cashiers were simply moved off-site, and they watched
you as you shopped.. The system of scanners and video cameras in each
store is... incredibly expensive"</p>
<hr />
<p>Vanden Heuvel, <em>The Nation</em>: "Ties between the government and the
private sector.. famously called the 'military-industrial complex' —
form the foundations of our national defense. Since 9/11,
between one-third and half of the nearly $14 trillion the Pentagon has
spent went to for-profit defense contractors. Dozens of members of
Congress and their spouses own millions of dollars’ worth of stock in
those companies"</p>
