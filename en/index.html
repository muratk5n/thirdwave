<p>CMB is likely a local phenomenon, not cosmological. The distribution
of galaxies cannot be explained properly, large scale structures
detected by JWST made sure of that. Bullet point #3 is the biggest
fail, there should be 20 TIMES more lithium than predicted by the
theory, yet it isn't there. The general spirit of the article is
correct though, Lambda CDM is in trouble (along with much of modern
physics).</p>
<hr />
<p>Explains so well? It fails at all those items listed. </p>
<p>"One significant experimental anomaly that does not appear to be going
away, and which may point to a fundamental weakness in either the
standard model or Big Bang cosmology, is the discrepancy in values of
the Hubble constant based on different experimental approaches. This
discrepancy is now known as the Hubble tension...  While [everyone] is
hard at work scrutinizing their methods and refining their results,
researchers are increasingly considering the unsettling possibility
that one or more of the underlying physical theories are just plain
wrong, at least on the length and time scales involved.</p>
<p>Key among these theories is the Lambda-CDM model of Big Bang
cosmology. Yet physicists and cosmologists are loath to discard this
model, because it explains so much so well:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cosmic microwave background radiation and its properties.</li>
<li>The large-scale structure and distribution of galaxies.</li>
<li>The present-day observed abundances of the light elements (hydrogen,
  deuterium, helium and lithium).</li>
<li>The accelerating expansion of the universe, as observed in
  measurements of distant galaxies and supernovas"</li>
</ul>

<p>Masse: "Maxwell’s electromagnetic field equations for free space can
be derived from classical elasticity theory as applied to transverse
elastic waves propagating in a perfectly elastic aether"</p>
<hr />
<p>Masse: "[Niels Bohr's] first postulated constraint is inconsistent
with classical mechanics, which permits any of a continuum of orbital
paths around the nucleus. The second constraint is inconsistent with
classical electromagnetism, which requires that accelerating electrons
radiate electro-magnetic energy that should be detectable... By
adopting these postulates, Bohr effectively assumed that neither
classical mechanics nor classical electromagnetism is applicable at
the scale of atomic dimensions..</p>
<p>The atomic model initially developed by chemists to explain the
formation and structure of molecules generally differed from the
atomic model developed by physicists primarily in one important
respect: the chemist’s atomic model was static..</p>
<p>From a theorem developed by Earnshaw (1842), we know that stable
equilibrium cannot be attained by a system of stationary point charges
interacting only according to Coulomb’s inverse-square force law...
Electrostatic equilibrium cannot exist by itself. Therefore, the force
keeping atomic electrons from falling into the nucleus cannot simply
be electromagnetic force. Moreover, since the atomic electrons are not
accelerating, the force keeping the atomic electrons from falling into
the nucleus cannot be centrifugal force. Only one possibility remains:
we must conclude that the force keeping the atomic electrons from
falling into the nucleus is the weak nuclear force...</p>
<p>The atom is static as proposed in early atomic models developed by
chemists.. Atoms are observed to possess a very great stability. This
stability can now be seen as the natural result of electron positions
in an atom generally corresponding to a minimum energy
configuration. Classical physics can explain both the stability and
structure of the atom"</p>
<hr />
<p>Electrons are static. Time only flows forward. There is no dark
matter. My o my... The hits keep on coming #RobertMasse</p>

<p>The story would be Stark was born as Victor Van Doom, but adapted by
Starks. Another version of VVD will have his usual storyline, from
Latveria, and now he is entering the picture. Both characters being
physically the same person could lead the audience seek similarities,
both tried to save others albeit via different methods. Add a little
MCU banter on top, start counting your profits (if there's any left
that is after paying RDJ and the Russos their mammoth share).</p>

<p>#MCU #Marvel Doom is <strong>not</strong> a Stark variant, but Stark is a Doom
variant? That can work.. #Gossip</p>

<p>DJT: "I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for
Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives
him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want
PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished
Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace"</p>

exchange.. The president and vice president each had harsh words for
the Ukrainian president"</p>

<p>They were mostly trolled. I think the joke is on you, for latching on
performative little acts for your "resistance fix".</p>
