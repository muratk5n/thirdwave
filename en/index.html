<p>"How the military-industrial complex captured US democracy" #AlJazeera</p>

<p>MEE: "Amnesty names companies contributing to apartheid and genocide
in Gaza..  The NGO named 15 companies on which it said it has gathered
credible evidence. This list includes American aircraft manufacturer
Boeing, whose munitions were used in Gaza, the Chinese company
Hikvision, which is a world leader in facial recognition technology,
and the American software manufacturer Palantir, which provides
services to the Israeli army and intelligence services."</p>
<hr />
<p>NBC News: "Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan have signed a
mutual defense pact that defines any attack on either nation as an
attack on both"</p>
<hr />
<p>The fact that the attack was not deterred despite Qatar's strong
relationship with the US (hosting a base, lavish gifts to Trump),
would have forced the Saudis look for options.</p>
<p>Reuters: "Saudi pact puts Pakistan's nuclear umbrella into Middle East
security picture.. Gulf Arab states said Israel, which has never
confirmed or denied possessing nuclear weapons, had shown itself to be
a direct threat following its unprecedented strikes on Qatar last week"</p>
<hr />
<p>These are the Russian gains this year, since January 2025. </p>

<p>Kellogg must be a paid shill of the MIC, an ongoing war, however
terrible its consequences on the Ukranian side, is still profitable.</p>
<p>"Keith Kellogg on Monday said he and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff recently advised President Trump that Russia is losing its
war on Ukraine"</p>
<hr />
<p>A second pro shooter is likely, that means Kirk was killed by an
organized entity, for a specific purpose. What could that purpose be?
The most powerful entity is the military-industrial complex. Possible
reasons - trying to change the subject from something they feared
more, attempting to foment civil war knowing they would profit from
it, or Kirk's recent doubts about Zionism (no-no, wars in ME are a
major source of profits). Whatever their reasons, we need to be clear,
Kirk would not have been sacrificed if he was a loyal soldier of the
Zionist cause. His doubts, and the fact that he aired them so publicly
would have moved him up in the list, in that list of possible targets.</p>
<hr />
<p>They shifted the moment he nodded to the point where he was told his
alleged motive so he looked like he was accepting it which is
different from the local TV version. That means the modification was
made at the ABC. Small things like this matter.. a manipulation here,
a manipulation there.. this is how perception is controlled...</p>
<p>I see traces of corporate cover-up here.</p>

<p>.30-06 will blow your head off, it is retarded they even talk about
this. They should have had a better patsy.</p>
<hr />
<p>CK was not hit by .30-06 caliber bullet (the one used by the suspect's
rifle). It was probably 22 (what the real shooter used).</p>
