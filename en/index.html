<p>The irresistable appeal of the <em>wunderwaffe</em>.. there is a certain
culture around this stuff in US, elevated by corporate media, and
neocon think-tank sponsored "fluffers". Guess who benefits from it? Of
course the military-industrial complex. They make money, at the same
time bottom 50% of Americans hold just 2.4% of U.S. wealth. Who wins,
who loses? Is the enemy abroad or within US borders?</p>

<p>Jake Sullivan: "Regardless, despite Ukrainian tactical successes of
using these [advanced] weapons beginning in October 2023, Sullivan
said they were not game-changers... 'We ended up providing Ukraine
with a very significant number of these systems down to the level
where, again, we basically have no more to give,' Sullivan
surmised. 'And the idea that they made a major difference
operationally in the war has not been borne out by the evidence. So I
think a lot has been put on this ATACMS decision to suggest, "Oh, if
only you’d given ATACMS, the war would have turned out totally
differently." And yet, the experience of the use of ATACMS by Ukraine
on the battlefield, I think, suggests that that is not, in fact, the
case'"</p>
<hr />
<p>Ledbetter, <em>Unwarrented Influence</em>: "One reason the [MIC] debate has
moved so little in the past twenty-five years is the lack of a clear
alternative to the MIC. The problem isn’t theory—there’s plenty of
theory. But the most visionary work on converting to a civilian
economy has usually come from expectations—always dashed—that changing
geopolitics would bring about large cuts in military spending. It may
be time for critics of the MIC to abandon that fantasy.  Barring some
extremely unlikely events—a dramatic reduction in perceived threats to
the United States, a wholesale rejection of the role of global
superpower, or a protracted economic crisis that makes military
spending impossible—it is difficult to see how the United States would
be sufficiently motivated to eliminate its MIC, let alone replace it
with something superior. The United States for the foreseeable future
will continue to spend hundreds of billions of dollars every year for
military purposes.</p>
<p>Scandals that spotlight ugly issues of military procurement—such as
the $1,868 toilet seat and similar outlandish spending that surfaced
during the 1980s—often create temporary impetus for limited
reform. Such scandals tend to flare up either when the country is
relatively at peace or after a military engagement becomes
protracted. Many legislative remedies have been passed in the wake of
scandals, such as increased requirements for competitive bidding and
limits on the revolving door between departing Defense Department
personnel and contractors. But scandals have been a recurring feature
of the political and military landscape at least since the 1930s, and
their reform power recedes as soon as another large conflict looms.</p>
<p>Hence, in the view of many critics, the size and sins of the MIC have
grown, not shrunk. As has been shown repeatedly in recent decades, it
is exceedingly difficult for the government to take even such
seemingly simple actions as closing a few military bases. It is one of
the pernicious features of a military-industrial complex that it is
nearly impervious to democratic reform"</p>

<p>Anglo-friend Israel threw in their support immediately.</p>
<p>India always had a balanced approach but it is a right rope to walk
on at the moment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Was India was perceived as too buddy-buddy w/ the Anglo and somebody
wanted to give a message..? There were attempts on upgrading rels with
US recently, and right after the India response to Kashmiri attack, IN
signed a massive trade deal w UK. Major powers of Brics all have
issues with US at the moment.. The attack is obscene in its daring
that it has to be some kind of message.</p>
<hr />
<p>BBC: "UK and India agree trade deal after three years of talks"</p>

<p>"The 2025 Pahalgam attack was.. in the Indian-administered Jammu and
Kashmir.. This incident is considered the deadliest attack on
civilians in India since the 2008 Mumbai attacks"</p>

<p>Hughes: "Instead of wallowing in chaos, as if our job is to give the
market what 'it' demands, we can harness markets to work for our
needs. 'Capitalism needs to be cared for by policymakers,' Secretary
of State Marco Rubio recently wrote. 'Our economy is supposed to work
for our nation; our nation does not work for our economy'"</p>
<hr />
<p>Hughes, <em>Marketcrafters</em>: "The stubborn persistence of the language of
'market failure' and 'government intervention' reinforces a faulty
vision of how the economy works. There is no sequence where markets
exist first, before a governance structure. Just as there was no state
of nature where humans existed without a social order, there was never
a time when markets flourished without a political order. The core
flaw of the 'market failure' paradigm is that it casts the government
as a reactive parental figure—one who merely corrects missteps or
offers aid after harm has occurred. In this view, the government’s
role is limited to 'intervening' in markets only after problems arise,
much like a parent scolding a child for misbehaving on the
playground. This notion of state interference with natural market
forces reinforces a false market-government dichotomy, sets up the
state in the role of nefarious nanny, and constrains its capacity to
foster widespread prosperity"</p>

<p>The impression I get is US agreed not to attack Houthis in return US
Navy not being a target. But ISR shipping continues to be a target.</p>

Houthi spokesperson"</p>

<p>Bessent: "[W]e’re reading every day what’s happening with factories in
China. And from an academic point of view, I can tell you that the
history of trade battles, we are the deficit country. The surplus
country always has the most to lose"</p>
<hr />
<p>CNBC: "China announces sweeping measures to ease policy in bid to
boost trade-war hit economy.. China will cut its key policy rate by 10
basis points and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis
points"</p>
