<p>It's kind of impressive to see Ghost become a real open source
alternative to WordPress. Many people have said it couldn't be done -
but by focusing on a certain kind of independent creator (adjacent to
both Medium and Substack), they've done it. It's a pretty amazing
feat"</p>

<p>The Lever: "Real estate is a huge force in New York’s economy.. Many
of these real estate interests hide their ownership information; in
Manhattan, 37 percent of the 41,000 total properties are owned by
secretive limited liability companies.. These property owners are
contributing to a housing crisis. The state ranks in the top five of
highest average home prices and has a severe housing shortage, pushing
up rents and rates of homelessness. This scarcity in housing is only
exacerbated by the fact that huge financial institutions are buying up
single-family homes and apartment buildings across the country"</p>

<p>They can build more housing thinking there is a shortage, but new ones
too will get snapped up because housing is an investment
device. Remember the infamous CDOs of 2008 crisis, they were built on
mortgage debt with varying degrees of risk, sliced up to various other
stakeholders. Someone holds that debt, and a big chunk of the
real-estate until it is paid off. This is one of the ways how big
money gets involved in housing. If you are holding a mortgage loan you
own a large chunk of an house.</p>

a universal, free and open, write once, deploy anywhere, application

shift to proprietary ecosystems and gatekeepers can extract heavy
