<p>H2 Central: "North Carolina-based OneH2, Inc. launches new cylinder
technology for 931 bar high-pressure hydrogen tube trailers. The
cylinder technology, a culmination of several years of development and
investment, operates under a unique special permit issued by the
U.S. Department of Transport for use on roads... While OneH2 has been
operating fleets of 520 bar hydrogen transport trailers for materials
handling applications, this new 931 bar design allows for direct fills
of higher-pressure, 700 bar automotive and heavy vehicle applications,
making hydrogen-fueled transport much more economical"</p>

<p>General Gerasimov, Chief of the RU General Staff: "[2013] What is
modern war?  What should the army be prepared for?  How should it be
armed?  Only after answering these questions can we determine the
directions of the construction and development of the armed forces
over the long term. To do this, it is essential to have a clear
understanding of the forms and methods of the use of the application
of force.</p>
<p>These days, together with traditional devices, nonstandard ones are
being developed. The role of mobile, mixed-type groups of forces,
acting in a single intelligence-information space because of the use
of the new possibilities of command-and-control systems has been
strengthened. Military actions are becoming more dynamic, active, and
fruitful. Tactical and operational pauses that the enemy could exploit
are disappearing. New information technologies have enabled
significant reductions in the spatial, temporal, and informational
gaps between forces and control organs. Frontal engagements of large
formations of forces at the strategic and operational level are
gradually becoming a thing of the past. Long-distance, contactless
actions against the enemy are becoming the main means of achieving
combat and operational goals. The defeat of the enemy’s objects is
conducted throughout the entire depth of his territory. The
differences between strategic, operational, and tactical levels, as
well as between offensive and defensive operations, are being
erased. The application of high-precision weaponry is taking on a mass
character. Weapons based on new physical principals and automatized
systems are being actively incorporated into military activity"</p>
