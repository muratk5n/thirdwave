<p>Market Screener: "[US] administration is piling pressure on Iraq to
allow Kurdish oil exports to restart or face sanctions alongside Iran,
eight sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. A
speedy resumption of exports from Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan
region would help to offset a potential fall in Iranian oil exports,
which Washington has pledged to cut to zero as part of Trump's
'maximum pressure' campaign against Tehran."</p>

<p>D'Alembert's Principle? Also a restatement of the second law.</p>
<hr />
<p>How did I find about Richard Masse's work? I was looking for a way to
explain how to derive the Lagrangian form of least action, the famous
$T - V$ formula from basic principles. I saw a derivation starting
from $\int mvds$, Euler's method, they call mass times velocity times
distance as "action", based on Maupertuis. But neither method sound
fundamental.  Feynman does a great job motivating $T - V$ in his
lectures (Vol II), he articulates extremely well why he thinks the
method works, but he is essentially putting lipstick on a pig. He is
rationalizing, the choice of this particular formula is arbitrary. It
is pulled out of the air, in a "let's see if this works" kind of
experiementation (obviously it did), explained later.</p>
<p>Then I searched for books on the subject, Masse's came up.  His
approach was Newton's second law is more fundamental, derive
Lagrangian from there, but still, not fundamental enough. This is
where his eather formulation comes in, he can derive second law from
it.</p>

<p>German newsmagazine Der Spiegel reported that the Max Planck Society
one of the world’s top scientific research institutions is
experiencing an uptick in applications from American scientists. [Its
president said the society regards the U.S. as 'a new talent pool' at
a time when the Trump administration seeks to cut billions in funding
to the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>There’s a deep historical irony in these recent developments: During
the Third Reich, it was the Max Planck Society then known as the
Kaiser Wilhelm Society that lost its best and brightest to the
U.S. and other countries"</p>

<p>The Guardian: "[2021] Literally meaning 'alternative-less',
<em>alternativlos</em> was Angela Merkel’s own version of a line usually
associated with Margaret Thatcher: 'There is no alternative.' But if
'TINA' was specifically used to close down debates over alternatives
to the market economy, Merkel’s government declared all type of policy
decisions alternativlos.. [eg open border immig policy]. Her use of
the phrase also inspired the naming of the first party to the right of
her CDU to make it into the Bundestag: Alternative für Deutschland"</p>
