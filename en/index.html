<p>Moyers: "[2016] Bill Clinton's legacy in empowering the consolidation
of corporate media is right up there with the North American Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA).. [T]he Telecommunications Act of
1996.. signed into law on February 8, 1996, was 'essentially bought
and paid for by corporate media lobbies,' as Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting (FAIR) described it, and radically 'opened the floodgates on
mergers.'"</p>

<p>BHJ: "In 1983, the US media was controlled by 50 companies.. by 2020
the number shrank to six... Not only are there six conglomerates alone
that mainly own the media, but these six are so interconnected that
they are practically one."</p>

<p>The second richest man on earth is about to be a major owner of TikTok.</p>
<p>The third richest man owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>The fourth richest man owns The Washington Post. </p>
<p>See the problem here?"</p>

<p>Mortgage demand, their use can cause house price increases, which in
turn raise demand for mortgages more, raising house prices again, and
on and on.. A snowball effect.  But if you rewind it all back, why did
people <em>start</em> to need bigger mortgages to begin with? The culprit:
rising inequality. The snowball naturally will make that worse too,
only the top 1% will have the money to lend to struggling home owners,
and middle class' monthly payments will generate a massive passive
income for the rich which they can use to buy even more assets.</p>

<p>Why isn't Canadian healthcare financing become problematic when their
conservatives are in power? Well because they haven't done a half
assed job like the US, their system has proper funding from get-go.</p>

<p>"Bush was pivoting to a War on Drugs as a new frontier for defense
contracts".. Them defense contracts</p>
<p>Katz, <em>Gangsters of Capitalism</em>: "Noriega rose through the ranks of
the National Guard of Panama, a force created during the Cold War
along the lines of the Somozas’ militia in Nicaragua.  While being
paid by the U.S. government to spy on leftist movements in Panama in
the early 1960s, he enrolled at the U.S. Army’s School of the Americas
training center, then based in the Canal Zone. (Noriega’s fellow
alumni included the future heads of death squads and secret police
across Latin America.) In 1970, Noriega was made Panama’s chief of
military intelligence. A year after, he was formally put on the
payroll of the CIA..</p>
<p>In January 1989, a former director of the CIA, George Herbert Walker
Bush, became president of the United States. Noriega, who had started
working with Bush in 1976, must have thought he had won the
lottery. But with the Cold War coming to an end, Bush was pivoting to
a War on Drugs as a new frontier for defense contracts, surveillance,
and a pretext for military control. Once in office, Bush turned on his
erstwhile employee, calling for Noriega to step down and imposing
crippling sanctions on Panama. On December 15, 1989, the Panamanian
national assembly named Noriega the country’s 'maximum leader of
national liberation' and symbolically declared war on the United
States. The next day, a group of U.S. troops got into an argument with
PDF soldiers at a roadblock in El Chorrillo. A Marine lieutenant named
Robert Paz was shot.  He died soon after at Gorgas Hospital in the
former Canal Zone. On December 20, citing the Colombian-born
U.S. Marine’s death as a justification, the United States invaded
Panama for the second time."</p>
