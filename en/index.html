<p>Forbes Breaking News: "Biden Admin Is ‘Deeply Invested’ In A
Successful Hydrogen Economy’: Sec. Granholm Tells Chris Coons"</p>
<hr />
<p>Power Mag: "[While using battery-electric vehicles] practical
challenges regarding range, charging duration, and wait times at
rapid-charging stations can significantly affect travel
efficiency. For instance, one of the Academy’s staff members, who has
driven a hydrogen FCEV car for six years, recently purchased a BEV
known for its better-than-average driving range. During a 330-mile
trip in California from Santa Barbara to San Francisco, which
typically takes a little more than 5.5 hours in a gasoline vehicle,
including one refueling stop just outside San Francisco to ensure a
full tank the next morning, the experience differed
markedly. Traveling at 70 miles per hour, which reduces range, the BEV
required three charging stops, including one on the outskirts of San
Francisco to start the next day fully charged. Due to waiting times
for available chargers and the actual recharging process, the journey
consumed more than 8 hours, highlighting the operational delays that
can accompany current BEV technology despite advancements both in
battery capacity and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Despite their growing popularity, BEVs continue to face other
challenges, especially in their reliance on the electrical grid. In
regions like California and Texas, where the grid often operates near
capacity, adding millions of BEVs will impose significant strains,
necessitating costly upgrades to transmission infrastructure or
systemwide blackouts and charging time restrictions, as have already
been imposed in both states. Additionally, the production of
lithium-ion batteries introduces environmental and ethical concerns,
such as significant disruption from raw material extraction and high
emissions from energy-intensive manufacturing processes. End-of-life
disposal and recycling of batteries present other substantial
challenges, highlighting the need for sustainable lifecycle
management.</p>
<p>Temperature sensitivity is another significant challenge for BEVs,
particularly affecting their range in colder climates. In such
conditions, lithium-ion batteries experience a marked decrease in
efficiency, resulting in much slower recharging time, reduced energy
storage capacity, and diminished vehicle range. This affects BEVs’
practicality for routine use and exacerbates frustration regarding
charging time and range anxiety among consumers"</p>

<p>Guilty on all counts? Overall this is bad news for Dems.. The offense
is low level, does not limit campaigning at all, the sentence will
likely be light and most likely be served after the 2024 election. In
the meantime Reps can play up like persecuted victim angle, gain more
votes.. </p>
