<p>H2 Central: "GreenIron signs major delivery agreement with Norwegian
Hydrogen... GreenIron is about to start operations at its green metals
production plant in Sandviken, Sweden, utilizing its patented
zero-emissions technology"</p>
<hr />
<p>AGBI: "The UAE has completed a pilot programme looking into the use of
green hydrogen to decarbonise the steel industry... Conventional steel
production accounts for around 8 percent of global carbon dioxide
emissions and about 30 percent of emissions from industry...</p>
<p>In the pilot project, green hydrogen electrolysers created using solar
power from the grid were used instead of natural gas to extract iron
from iron ore, a vital step in steel making. The programme is aligned
with both the UAE’s National Hydrogen Strategy 2050 and the Abu Dhabi
Low Carbon Hydrogen Policy.</p>
<p>[T]he production of green hydrogen has started something of an arms
race between the bloc of six GCC countries – the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia’s $8.4 billion Neom Green Hydrogen plant is set to be the
world’s largest, and is scheduled for full operations by the end of
2026. And earlier this month, the kingdom’s Public Investment Fund
launched the Energy Solutions Company with an estimated 10 billion
investment in green hydrogen"</p>

<p>Gold is not rising because "money is being debased". It is rising
because econ is not working for the majority, goes in a funk... Low
rates forever. That makes assets more attractive, like housing and
gold. Gold is not some magic money-subtitute.  Liberterian libertards
are wrong on this one, just like those MMT types. Money cannot be tied
to a finite resource, and money cannot be printed infinitely bcz
somehow "it's fine until you see inflation".</p>
<hr />
<p>We need to see the big picture however.. Gold is going through the
roof because the market is betting on low growth, low rates, which
will raising the price of assets, ie gold.</p>
<hr />
<p>Use it for trading I don't care</p>
<hr />
<p>The regression below can be predictive, shift gold price back, is
still works.</p>
<hr />
<p>$R^2$ is ridiculously high. Reverse correlation with oil, Euro,
positive correlation w SP 500, silver (makes sense, related
comodities). Oil is an indicator of econ activity, high activity means
high demand for oil, therefore high price. Low activity means low
rates, a boon for gold, since it is considered an asset.</p>
<hr />
<pre><code class="python">r = smf.ols('GLD2 ~ SPX + USO + SLV + EURUSD', data=df).fit()
print ('R^2', np.round(r.rsquared,2), '%')
print (r.params)

<p>Is gold price correlated to anything? It is known there are
correlations with SP 500, oil, silver and some other instruments.</p>

<p>The Decline of Public Property</p>

<p>Here's an idea gov provides initial funding to hundreds of non-profits
each year, those orgs can provide employment, and the ones in the red
will go bust anyway, remaining ones can continue providing a public
service in an efficient way. Gov can track the founders for potential
abuse but otherwise just let the existing machinery take care of them.</p>
<hr />
<p>If 'merica cannot get over its distaste for gov, non-profits can
provide another path. The future surely does not lie with exclusively
for-profit co's, that mentality brought you into the mess you find
yourself in today, perhaps non-profits can do something more, represent
larger swaths of econ in monetary terms, albeit with some push by gov.</p>
<hr />
<p>"American commitment to responsible citizenship". There is that
feeling, sure... Tied to a culture code certainly. Is it useful?
Debatable.</p>
<p>Drucker, <em>Managing the Non-Profit Org</em>: "[We] know that the
non-profits discharge a much bigger job than taking care of specific
needs. With every second American adult serving as a volunteer in the
non-profit sector and spending at least three hours a week in
non-profit work, the non-profits are America's largest 'employer.' But
they also exemplify and fulfil the fundamental American commitment to
responsible citizenship in the community. The non-profit sector..
represents about [2-3%].. of America's gross national product"</p>
