<p>The ongoing erosion of my ability to tell where information I enter
into any random text box on my computer is sent and stored has me
increasingly tempted to switch back to a 386 and WordPerfect 5
whatever for MS-DOS"</p>

<p>Gov flexing its muscle, fantastic... Any anti-trust action with
results is a win. The public then can get used to similar acts later,
Live Nation is a great place to start - gov can ride Taylor Swift's
popularity and the protests of those crying "Swifties" towards
victory. I am waiting to see the scoreboard, hopefully Government 1:
Bidness: 0.</p>
<p>AP News: "Government sues Ticketmaster owner and asks court to break
up company’s monopoly on live events.. Ticketmaster and its owner,
Live Nation Entertainment, have a long history of clashes with major
artists and their fans, including Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen"</p>

<p>Arne Schirracher is a science historian, and a physics PhD himself.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hilbert was one of the top mathematicians of his time w emphasis on
physics, the story goes after hearing bits and pieces of Einstein's
work-in-progress on GR, he plowed through on the rest of theory and
nearly beat Einstein to it for the final product (bcz his grasp of
math fundamentals and its relation to physics were so strong, he could
crush it even as a complete outsider). But he withheld his claim and
let Einstein have his deserved glory.</p>
<hr />
<p>A lot hinges on Kirchoff's Law to be correct; if not, everything from
gaseous Sun theory to Hawking radiation is in question. Cosmologists will
be <em>phucked</em>. Well even more than they already are..</p>
<hr />
<p>.. and the proof provided later turned out incorrect. No experimental
result can prove KL either. </p>
<hr />
<p>Arne Schirracher: "[2013, David] Hilbert concluded [in 1912] that
Kirchhoff’s law on heat radiation, which had represented complex
experimental results in a relation as simple and persuasive as Ohm’s
law, had not been made plausible, even in the most simple, special
cases. For more than fifty years, physicists had failed to provide a
proof for one of their most precious laws"</p>

<p>She is not a 10. Not even a 9 or 8. Dam. But maybe the her VP polling
is good, dunno.</p>
<hr />
<p>Does that mean Trump will pick Sefanik as VP?</p>
<hr />
<p>TDB: "[02/24] Trump’s New York roots—as well as Republican Lee
Zeldin’s surprisingly close defeat in the state’s 2022 gubernatorial
race—actually have him musing about the possibility that he could win
his home state. He continues to talk about doing a rally in Madison
Square Garden. If he adds Stefanik to the ticket, at the very least
the campaign believes it will force Biden to spend money in a state
where TV spots are not cheap"</p>

<p>Politico: "‘Biden didn't come to the Bronx’: Trump makes a foray into
Democratic turf"</p>
<hr />
<p>After decades of elevating businessman to such great heights, the
uniparty machinery got bamboozled by a legit businessman in 2016, the
very figure they themselves brought to God-like status. That was the
great irony of Trump's victory. If you did not like that situation
ponder your role in his rise to power, not to mention creating the
economic condition leading to working class abandoning the Democrats
in droves for a guy who never rode in public transit in his
life. Shitlibs got what they deserved. </p>
