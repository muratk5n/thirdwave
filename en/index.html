<p>Miran is describing today's situation exactly. When US was supplying
the reserve currency when the world econ was small, there was no
problem. But today, where US represents only a quarter of global GDP,
problems started to arise.</p>
<hr />
<p>Miran, <em>Maga Lago Accords</em>: "[Today's trade situation] reflect what
can be described as a 'Triffin world,' after Belgian economist Robert
Triffin. In Triffin world, reserve assets are a form of global money
supply, and demand for them is a function of global trade and savings,
not the domestic trade balance or return characteristics of the
reserve nation.  When the reserve country is large relative to the
rest of the world, there are no significant externalities imposed on
the reserve country from its reserve status. The distance from the
Triffin equilibrium to the trade equilibrium is small. However, when
the reserve country is smaller relative to the rest of the world—say,
because global growth exceeds the reserve country’s growth for a long
period of time—tensions build and the distance between the Triffin
equilibrium and the trade equilibrium can be quite large. Demand for
reserve assets leads to significant currency overvaluation with real
economic consequences"</p>

<p>The timeline, events leading up to Watergate makes it clear, the leaks
started once Nixon made overtures to China, and things got worse after
the withdrawal from Vietnam.</p>

<p>He is right.. Nixon was likely framed. US has its private-corporate
military-industrial complex, the surface state to thank for that.</p>
<hr />
<p>Entertainment Weekly: "[Bill Murray said] When I read.. the book
written by what's-his-name, Bob Woodward, about Belushi, I read like
five pages and I went, 'Oh my God, they framed Nixon,'" referencing
Woodward's role in breaking the Watergate scandal that led to the
resignation of President Richard Nixon.. 'if he writes about my friend
that I've known for half of my adult life — talking to the people of
the outer, outer circle — what the hell could they have done to
Nixon?'"</p>
