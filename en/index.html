<p>"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Earth’s lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.</p>
<p>Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"</p>

<p>Halton Arp: "[One galaxy I cataloged] has a large companion on the end
of a luminous arm. In 1971 a spectrum revealed that this companion was
8,000 km/sec higher redshift than the central, active Seyfert
galaxy. This amount of excess redshift cannot be accomodated in the
conventional picture where redshifts mean velocities in an expanding
universe. They could not be at such different distances and be
physically interacting. When Fred Hoyle heard about this he came up
from the Cal Tech campus to my Carnegie office and asked to see the
original picture. In 1972 he gave the prestigious Russell Lecture at
the Seattle meeting of the American Astronomical Society and outlined
a theory whereby younger galaxies radiated intrinsically redshifted
photons. His theory of growing particle masses was a more general
solution to the conventional field equations but was physically a
Machian (not Einsteinian theory). At the end of the lecture he said
the NGC 7603 observation created a crisis in physics and we needed to
cross over the bridge to a radically more general physics...</p>
<p>Over the years the evidence for non-velocity redshifts has grown
enormously, both for quasars and galaxies. A number of researchers
have tried to make the establishment admit the consequences of this
evidence. But it has been suppressed and ignored. However, In an event
of great irony, 30 years after Hoyle's talk featuring NGC 7603, two
young Spanish astronomers have announced the finding of two
quasar-like, much higher redshift objects imbedded in the arm which
connects the low redshift galaxy to the higher redshift companion of
NGC 7603. As in many past cases, this result alone should have settled
instantly and finally the existance of intrinsic redshifts. Instead
the paper was turned down by 'Nature' Magazine, rejected by the
'Astrophysical Journal' and only finally accepted by the European
Journal 'Astronomy and Astrophysics'...</p>
<p>The ejection in opposite directions of material from active galaxies,
including very high redshift material like quasars, has been building
up now for over 37 years. Yet the radio map shown here and the
notation that his object had 'two redshifts', one a 'background
object', lay unoticed and unchallenged in the voluminous literature
for 4 years! When it was finally submitted to the Astronomical Society
of the Pacific it was rejected. In spite of my being a past President
of this organization they refused other observational results and
communications and I had to resign. It is particularly vexing that the
A.S.P. has as a primary goal educating the public about astronomy. But
since it was hijacked by fanatical Big Bang adherents, it has been
exactly misinforming the public"</p>

<p>Fleming: "Einstein was stuck, in that by denying the existence of
aether, or any other medium of transmission of light, he still wanted
to explain clock rate slowing and hypothetical distance
contraction. In order to do that, he imagined that space itself must
change its spatial and time dimensions when that space is moving
relative to other space. His space was not a wallless container but
was physical. In order to do away with aether theory, he had to treat
space like it had physical properties, including spatial and time
dimensions that were variable. Therein lies Einstein’s fallacy. He
claimed space is non-physical and physical at the same time...</p>
<p>We now know experimentally that all space contains vacuum energy
consistent with Max Planck’s theory of quantum oscillators. Per his
theory it is impossible for space to be empty. Planck oscillators are
something physical that we can use to explain all the known physical
properties of space. Quantum vacuum energy has wavelengths and
frequencies that give space its spatial and time dimensionality. The
quantum vacuum also gives us a standard reference frame to use when
making relativistic frame transformations, as well as giving us a
physical medium for light and force transmission...</p>
<p>Einstein had not actually solved the problem. He merely turned space
into a new form of aether while still failing to provide a physical
explanation for its physical properties"</p>

<p>Cuck Schumer, Pelosi both supported the other guy. I guess we should
be happy Martin got the job by that measure alone.</p>
<hr />
<p>Politico: "[DNC] members delivered a clear message to their party’s
power-brokers in picking Martin as chair: They largely think
billionaire donors and big-name elected officials are out of touch
with the core of the base... Suffering the biggest upset: Some
Democratic billionaires who hoped to see Wikler take the top
job. LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and George Soros’ Democracy PAC
kicked in $250,000 each to the FORWARD PAC backing Wikler for chair"</p>

<p>NYT: "Ken Martin, the Minnesota Democratic chairman, was elevated on
Saturday to lead the Democratic National Committee, taking the helm of
a rudderless party staring down an uncertain future.Mr. Martin, a
seasoned party operator who comes across as a low-key, mild-mannered
Midwesterner, ran on pledges to broaden the party’s appeal —
especially among working-class voters — and to ensure its ability to
compete in races up and down the ballot, and across the country"</p>
