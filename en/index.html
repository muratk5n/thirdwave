<p>UtilityDive: "Unlike fuels in use today, hydrogen produces no carbon
when itâ€™s burned or used as a feedstock and has applications for the
industrial sector including steel, cement and chemicals. The U.S. is
sitting on the potential to produce more.. For those who attended New
York Climate Week and the U.N. General Assembly in September, much of
the 'buzz' was around hydrogen production, whether it be from natural
gas or zero-carbon resources like renewables or nuclear power...</p>
<p>Clean hydrogen production has the potential to scale to about 10
million metric tons annually by 2030 â€” which is roughly equivalent to
10 million gallons of gasoline and more than a 900% increase from
current levels â€” to meet domestic demand... In the Middle East, Oman
is planning to build an estimated 620 miles of hydrogen pipelines. In
the European Union, Denmark alone is anticipated to be home to more
than a third of the worldâ€™s new hydrogen pipelines between 2022 and
2026"</p>

<p>The irony here is the systems that were supposed to be "smart" need to
be goaded like cattle. There are now books on "prompt engineering"
how-to guides on directing "AI". Basically LLM AI is inherently
stupid.</p>

<p>NYT: "[2016] Four barbers and a firefighter were pondering their
future under a Trump presidency at the Upper Cutz barbershop last
week.. They admitted that they could not complain too much: Only two
of them had voted... At.. [the] bustling barbershop.. talk of politics
inevitably comes back to one man: Barack Obama. Mr. Obamaâ€™s elections
infused many here with a feeling of connection to national politics
they had never before experienced. But their lives have not gotten
appreciably better, and sourness has set in. 'We went to the beach,'
said Maanaan Sabir, 38, owner of the Juice Kitchen, a brightly painted
shop a few blocks down West North Avenue, using a metaphor to describe
the emotion after Mr. Obamaâ€™s election. 'And then eight years
happened.'  All four barbers had voted for Mr. Obama. But only two
could muster the enthusiasm to vote this time. And even then, it was a
sort of protest. One wrote in Mrs. Clintonâ€™s Democratic opponent,
Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The other wrote in himself"</p>

<p>Chris Hedges: "The main section in the Wye Agreement was not about
withdrawals, but about security. And this was liberally laced with
references to terrorists, terrorist cells and terrorist organizations
involving, of course, only Palestinian violence. There was not a
single reference to killers who had come from the Jewish settler
community... Each new accord with Israel involved a subtle rewriting
of previous agreements. Madrid, with all its safeguards for the
Palestinians, turned into Oslo, no safeguards at all, and a system of
Israeli withdrawal that was so constructed that deadlines no longer
had to be met. This turned into the 1997 Hebron Accord, which allowed
Jewish colonists to stay in the town and made an Israeli withdrawal
contingent upon an end to anti-Israeli violence. In 1998 the Wye
Agreement even dropped the land for peace logo. It was now billed as
the land for security agreement. Peace being at least temporarily
unobtainable.</p>
<p>Peace means respect, mutual trust, cooperation. Security means no
violence, but it also means prison, hatred, and as we already knew,
torture. In return, the Palestinians could have 40% of their territory
under their control, as opposed to 90% they expected under
Oslo.. [Robert Fisk] totally captured this process by which Israel
makes an agreement which was always open ended, always done in stages,
and then rolls it backward, rolls it backward, rolls it backward,
which, of course, we're now witnessing with the areas A, B and C in
the West Bank, which have been violated. I think the
Palestinians.. are allowed to control on their own, about 19% of the
West Bank. But now you have the settlers making incursions into
Ramallah"</p>
