<p>TechXplore: "'Nearly sustainable' hydrogen could cut ammonia
production emissions by 95%.. In a study looking at the European
ammonia industry, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science
and Technology (HKUST) and ETH Zurich have now calculated the
conditions under which it would be worthwhile to switch ammonia
production to green or almost green hydrogen. The research is
published in Nature Communications.</p>
<p>Two results stand out. First, in some European countries such as
Norway, Spain, Hungary or Poland, ammonia production from green or
almost green hydrogen would already make economic sense today. In
these countries, generating sustainable electricity from solar or wind
energy is particularly cost-effective"</p>
