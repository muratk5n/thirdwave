<p>Khanna, <em>The Second World</em>: "[2008] In a nation of privatized
privilege, services that work well—fancy apartment buildings, hotels,
restaurants, health clubs, private taxis—all cater to the elite and
their private economy. For everyone else, things fall apart: Public
transportation systems—roads, tunnels, trains, and buses—are in
various states of disrepair; broadband Internet penetration has fallen
behind Europe’s; mobile telephone networks are substandard; and
archaic taxi cabs don’t accept electronic payment. Even worse, America
may prove to be afflicted by the same oil curse as many second-world
states. Much of its infrastructure was built during the post–World War
II boom when America was the world’s largest oil producer and
exporter — but today its water pipes and power stations are run-down,
causing lead and mercury poisoning and sporadic but massive
blackouts. During New York’s transit strikes in the frigid winter
of 2005, commuters trudging long distances through the snow declared
that they felt like they lived in the third world.  Laissez-faire is a
somewhat inaccurate way to describe America’s social and economic
principles when skewed societal structures actually favor the
perpetuation of inequality"</p>

<p>"100x larger hydrogen-rich hydrothermal system found using
submersible.. Scientists have discovered a massive hydrogen-rich
hydrothermal system beneath the western Pacific seafloor. The system
was explored using the crewed submersible Fendouzhe. The system offers
a new glimpse into deep-sea serpentinization—a process in which iron-
and magnesium-rich rocks chemically react with water to form
serpentine minerals and release hydrogen.</p>

<p>Scientists from the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (IOCAS) revealed that the system is critical to understanding
Earth’s internal processes and the conditions that may have fostered
life’s origins."</p>
