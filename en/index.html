<p>Thomas Frank, <em>New York Times</em>: "The Elites Had It Coming..  At the
Republican convention in July, JD Vance described the ruination
visited on his working-class town in Ohio by NAFTA and trade with
China, both of which he blamed at least in part on Mr. Biden, and also
the human toll taken by the Iraq war, which he also contrived to blame
on Mr. Biden. Today Mr. Vance is the vice president-elect, and what I
hope you will understand, what I want you to mull over and take to
heart and remember for the rest of your life, is that he got there by
mimicking the language that Americans used to associate with labor,
with liberals, with Democrats..</p>
<p>A party of the left that identifies with people like Mr. Cheney is a
contradiction in terms, a walking corpse..</p>
<p>I have begun to doubt that any combination of financial disaster or
electoral chastisement will ever turn on the lightbulb for the
liberals. I fear that 90s-style centrism will march on, by a
sociological force of its own, until the parties have entirely
switched their social positions and the world is given over to
Trumpism. Can anything reverse it? Only a resolute determination by
the Democratic Party to rededicate itself to the majoritarian vision
of old: a Great Society of broad, inclusive prosperity. This means
universal health care and a higher minimum wage. It means robust
financial regulation and antitrust enforcement. It means unions and a
welfare state and higher taxes on billionaires, even the cool ones. It
means, above all, liberalism as a social movement, as a coming
together of ordinary people"</p>

<p>DIW: "[Our study shows e]nvironmental zones have positive effects on
school performance and mental health – More primary school students
make the jump to high school – Antidepressant prescriptions,
depression and anxiety disorders are declining – Sustainable transport
policy should not only be promoted with an eye on the environment</p>
<hr />
<p>"Environmental Zones (Umweltzonen) in Germany.. There are three
different stickers: a green one certifying that the vehicle is
environmentally acceptable; a yellow one for less acceptable vehicles
and a red one for those that are still less acceptable... Gasoline-
and diesel-powered vehicles without catalytic converters will be
unable to get any kind of a sticker and will not be permitted in the
environmental zones. All gasoline-powered cars with catalytic
converters will get a green sticker. The first environmental zones
were established on January 1, 2008 in Berlin, Cologne and Hannover"</p>

<p>Academic degrees should play a lesser role, also, they way degrees are
judged needs to change. We need to go back to a <a href="./0119/2011/02/grading.html">fail/pass based
education</a> where student study the
subject until a pass grade, however long that takes. The system can be
turned upside down, pre-recorded videos deliver the lecture, pass/fail
judgement will require an actual person, that professional/expert
would be part of a DOED team of expert test adminstrators. Exam would
be scheduled at will whenever a student feels ready.</p>
