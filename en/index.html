<p>JCB: "Leading contractor BAM Construction.. has been trialling the
first JCB 540-180H Loadall on the Tea Factory regeneration project in
Digbeth, Birmingham. Powered by a hydrogen combustion engine developed
by JCB at its plant in Derbyshire, the machine offers a zero-carbon
emission driveline, that offers the same power and torque
characteristics as the conventional diesel-powered model.</p>
<p>'We’ve noticed no difference in the way the machine operates. We have
to refuel the machine in a different way, but it’s a simple and
straightforward process.'</p>
<p>JCB has been delivering hydrogen to the site in a refuelling trailer,
that simply connects to the Loadall and refuels at the touch of a
button"</p>

<p>Letting stray dogs roam about likely was a toxic mix of pre-modern
feudal customs seeping into modern daily life. Dogs were first
attracted into agrarian human habitats (the oldest ones being in and
around Anatolia) bcz of its trash, some stayed around and made
themselves useful, became domesticated. They were useful to have
around the farm. But out on the street, amidst the hubbub of modern
life they are out of place. Almost all modern cities ban stray dogs,
"Turkey" was the rare holdout.</p>
<hr />
<p>TR culls stray dogs after toddler dies in attack? There was a major
stray animal problem, for sure. TR libs were extremely protective of
"stray dogs rights", but you can't argue w/ the mother of a dead
child.</p>
<hr />
<p>Politico: "Senate passes spending bill to avoid a government
shutdown..While Republicans control the Senate, they do not hold the
60 seats necessary to break a filibuster. Ultimately, 10 Democrats
voted with Republicans to advance the bill to avoid a shutdown...</p>
<p>The vote highlights deep divisions within the Democratic party over
how to respond to President Trump in his second term. The decision by
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to support the funding
bill sparked an intense backlash from House Democrats, who almost
unanimously opposed it"</p>
<hr />
<p>BB formulation says one thing, reality is another. <em>Is there something
wrong with the formulation</em>?</p>
<p>Paper: "We report a new study of this line of sight [into the Small
Magellanic Cloud] by means of high-resolution spectra obtained with
the ESPRESSO spectrograph..  the low metallicity of the cloud leads to
an absolute Li abundance of A(7Li) ≈ 2.2, which differs from the
expectation from big bang nucleosynthesis"</p>
