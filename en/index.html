billion loan to help India accelerate low-carbon energy development by
promoting a market for green hydrogen as well as electrolysers and

<p>Racer: "After four seasons of Extreme E, Extreme H will arrive next
year... 'There’s never been more need to look into new ways of using
alternative energies than now,' [CEO Agag says]. '.. we’re going to
focus on cars and the use of hydrogen for cars; it’s a championship
that is going to be focused on hydrogen in general.'..</p>
<p>Agag has spoken before about Extreme H’s ambition to attract energy
companies and tech companies.. manufacturers are once again taking
note, especially as consumer doubts around conventional EVs remain.</p>
<p>'We had a very, very productive meeting a few weeks ago where a very
large number of car manufacturers showed up with great interest for
the championship,' he says. 'I was surprised myself'"</p>

<p>It looks like the rabid trader, plutocracy-based culture also survived
in Netherlands. It's interesting, when we look at all the countries
who are most disturbed by Russia (which descends from a security /
militocratic culture) are the Anglo, and Netherlands..  In relation to
its size and influence, the amt of aid NL supplies to Ukraine is
massive. The issue might be cultural.</p>

<p>Turchin: "Gunpowder weapons underwent a rapid evolution during the
fifteenth century.. Small principalities and city-states could no
longer hide behind their walls, which were easily breached by
cannons. Intense military competition between European states weeded
out those that couldn’t raise large armies; produce muskets and
artillery in quantity; and build expensive modern fortifications that
could withstand cannon fire...</p>
<p>The Military Revolution also triggered a revolution in governance and
finance because successful states had to learn how to efficiently
extract and use wealth from their populations.. As a result, medieval
militocracies gradually evolved into ruling classes that combined
military and administrative functions...</p>
<p>[T]hanks to its protected position in the British Isles.. England
dispense[d] with the standing army.. The squirearchy, which started as
a military class, gradually lost its military character and became
simply a class of landowners.. A large merchant class evolved.. the
United Kingdom came to be ruled by an elite that combined economic and
administrative functions... Although most plutocracies rapidly went
extinct, some lingered longer than others... The Netherlands survived
into the twenty-first century, in part thanks to its waterways and
canals"</p>

automaker told him a replacement would cost 26,000.. Mario Zelaya

<p>Liberals will say 'hey, why don't you lefties stop the "far-right"?'</p>
<p>Because in what is called 'politics', 'left' parties are only allowed
to 'win' if they'll continue all the current economic systems -
capitalism and the wealthy with power and status at the top.</p>
<p>Otherwise the whole establishment's might will get unleashed to stop
them, well before they can make the required real economic change, as
that is what would end their whole scam taking [from] the rest of us"</p>

<p>Electrolytes: regulate body's electrical functions. A lot of hidden
ailments are tied to a lack of it: calcium, chloride, magnesium,
potassium, sodium. There are water solubile tablets, easy to
take. Note these elements are not all vitamins, but specific minerals
for neural sys.</p>

<p><em>Dark Matter</em>, good show. Its science is unsurprisingly bullshit

<p>Joan Westennerg: "6 months ago, I left the bullshit industrial
complex.. I used to be good at spinning stories. Give me a half-baked
startup idea, a semi-charismatic founder and a fistful of VC dollars,
and I could write a story compelling enough it barely mattered whether
there was an ounce of truth in it... [But] I would lie awake at 3 AM,
staring at the ceiling. My life was slipping away, and I had nothing
to show for it but a series of cynical half truths paid for by shit
shovelling wannabe billionaires hell bent on leaving the world worse
off than they found it. I knew I was a part of something poisonous. It
had been years since I'd displayed a shred of journalistic
integrity...</p>
<p>One morning, I sat down at my desk to craft yet another press release
touting yet another 'game-changing' startup that had raised - yet
another - $25 million. And I realized I couldn't remember the last
time I'd written something I believed in. The words that used to flow
felt like trying to squeeze ancient toothpaste from an empty
tube. That was the day I cracked... Somewhere along the way, I'd
allowed my writing—the thing that used to give me purpose—to be
co-opted by the bullshit industrial complex...</p>
<p>I have zero faith in the idea that unfettered vulture capitalism and a
blind pursuit of 'disruption' will lead us to a better world. I've
seen how perverse incentives and boiler room pressure to deliver
exponential growth can warp even the most idealistic founders'
vision. I've watched brilliant minds get sucked into the vortex of
funding rounds and vanity metrics, losing sight of why they started
their companies in the first place"</p>
