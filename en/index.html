<p>ECP: "With aims to become a key player in the global energy
transition, Egypt is advancing its green hydrogen ambitions with a $40
billion investment plan. Through various agreements with international
developers and the introduction of supportive laws including tax
credits, VAT exemptions and port fee reductions, Egypt is positioning
itself as a major green hydrogen exporter, particularly to Europe. The
country’s abundant solar and wind resources, combined with its
strategic location, make it a prime hub for green energy projects...</p>
<p>Last March, construction engineering companies SK Ecoplant and China
State Construction Engineering Corporation agreed to collaborate on a
$2 billion green hydrogen and ammonia facility in Egypt's Suez Canal
Economic Zone (SCZone). The project will harness 778 MW of renewable
energy —- 500 MW ofsolar and 278 MW of wind - to produce 50,000 tons
of green hydrogen and 250,000 tons of green ammonia annually. The
project is slated for completion by 2029"</p>

<p>With the help of DASA funding, Wastewater Fuels have developed a
unique innovation to harness energy from wastewater. The system uses
stainless steel mesh rods in wastewater to break down organic material
into hydrogen ions which are converted into hydrogen gas and stored in
the rods. Proven through several trials, Wastewater Fuels is preparing
for the production of a full-scale sewage facility to be deployed at

<p>1968 two term flag.. This is important esp. for this election, bcz '68
was like now, Dem party chaos, low net approval, started with one guy,
who did not run (shot), different guy ran, lost even though the party
was incumbent. With the data correction and some other changes, adv
goes to Reps.</p>

<p>Bill F-ing Clinton.. That spineless, poser, know-nothing
douchebag. All was done for the cameras.. for the show.</p>
<p>Fisk: "Every few months in the Middle East, the Chamberlain bell is
rung. 'Peace in our time,' it tolls. And anxious not to be blamed for
its failure, the Arabs and Israelis leap to express their support. The
moment Ehud Barak was elected Labour prime minister of Israel in 1999,
the satellite television boys and girls—along with the ever-supine BBC
World Service—were putting the 'peace process' back 'on track' once
more, even though Barak had made it clear that Jerusalem must remain
the united capital of Israel, that major Jewish settlements would stay
and that no Palestinian refugees from 1948 could expect to return to
their original Arab villages...</p>
<p>The pumpkin of the Oslo agreement could never be turned into the
golden carriage of peace, but it took the collapse of the Arafat–Barak
talks at Camp David in 2000 to prove this true. Even then, Clinton was
reduced to claiming that the Oslo negotiations were 'based' on UN
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338— which was not what Oslo said
at all - and even Arafat must have realised that the end had come when
Madeleine Albright made her preposterous offer of 'a sense of
sovereignty' over Muslim religious sites in Jerusalem. Only the silly
villages that Arafat might have controlled outside his would-be
capital would have 'virtually full sovereignty,' according to the
Americans. There then followed the wilfully misleading leaks to the
effect that Arafat had turned down 95 per cent of 'Palestine' — in
reality around 64 per cent of the 22 per cent of 'Palestine' that was
left. Barak would not give up Jerusalem or abandon the
settlements. Arafat would not make the 'concession' of ceding Israeli
control over all of Jerusalem. So the sons of Abraham acknowledged
what so many Israelis and Palestinians knew all along: that Oslo
didn’t work. Clinton predictably saw fit to praise the stronger of the
two parties; he spoke of Barak’s 'courage' and 'vision,' but merely of
Arafat’s commitment. So much for America’s role as 'honest broker' of
the Middle East peace"</p>

<p>Another issue w "spend until inflation do not tax" #DumbMMT approach
is gov can spend, spend, spend and never see much inflation.
Inflation has to do with money given to all, in excess, and its
circulation creates inflation. In an unequal economy even direct aid
to citizens will end up with the rich, there will be no circulation,
ie no inflation. Direct aid will go to rent, Walmart purchases, a new
iPhone, money gone. It all ends up with big corp. Now the rich will
take that money, buy even more assets; more homes, buy more government
debt, Walmart will become a bigger behemoth. In a way the rich gets
paid twice, not only did they end up with the direct aid, they now
gobble up more assets, making more money with money.</p>

<p>Reuters: "Prabowo becomes Indonesia's eighth president.. from being a
former military commander.. to sweeping the polls and now leading the
country of 280 million people... In a wide-ranging speech lasting
about an hour, Prabowo said self-sufficiency for food was possible
within five years, while also pledging to become self-sufficient in
energy.</p>
<p>Prabowo also touched on foreign policy during his speech, saying
Indonesia was non-aligned on the global stage, but that he stood in
support of the Palestinian people and said Jakarta was ready to send
more aid to Gaza"</p>
