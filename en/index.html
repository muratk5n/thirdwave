<p>"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Earth‚Äôs lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.</p>
<p>Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"</p>

<p>Werdmuller: "For the last few years, AI vendors have had an
interesting marketing playbook: they‚Äôve described the potential power
of the technologies as being so great that it could lead to an
artificial general intelligence that could either kill humanity or
leave us behind and head for the stars. We ignore its power at our
peril.</p>
<p>As it turned out, OpenAI and Microsoft‚Äôs definition of 'artificial
general intelligence' was that the technologies would reach one
hundred billion dollars in revenue. It wasn‚Äôt tied to capabilities
around reasoning, and did not, in actuality, relate to a Terminator
future. It just meant that they‚Äôd be making a lot of money from
it. All the talk of humanity-destroying intelligence and the
existential questions that derived from it just served to draw
attention to their services"</p>

<p>The Verge: "'I have no idea what‚Äôs going on in this industry right
now,' Ford CEO Jim Farley said during his company‚Äôs capital markets
event Monday. He referenced electric vehicles .. 'Higher ranges will
necessitate bigger batteries', he noted, adding, 'These batteries are
huge'"</p>

<p>"Department of Government Efficiency [staffer] resigned on Thursday
after now-deleted racist social media posts were resurfaced... Marko
Elez, a 25-year-old software engineer, was working inside the Treasury
Department.. 'Normalize Indian hate,' [he posted].. In July of last
year, the account posted: 'Just for the record, I was racist before it
was cool'"</p>

<p>RSF vs SAF in Sudan - which is preferable? Neither is democratic, but
one is at least the official military, so given all else equal SAF
is. Egypt is behind them, so that's a plus (Egypt's stability is
crucial for ME).</p>

<p>F24: "Donald Trump bans transgender athletes from participating in
women's sports.. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order
banning transgender athletes from women's sports, citing the need to
protect female athletes. The order, which could strip schools of
federal funding for non-compliance, was signed at the White House amid
applause from supporters, including key Republicans. Trump declared
the move a defense of women's sports traditions"</p>

<p>TASS: "Ukrainian settlement is Trump‚Äôs top priority, US diplomat
says.. Russian President Vladimir Putin has previously listed the
conditions for resolving the conflict, including the withdrawal of
Ukrainian forces from Donbass and Novorossiya, Kiev's refusal to join
NATO, the lifting of all Western sanctions against Moscow, and the
establishment of Ukraine's non-aligned and nuclear-free status"</p>

<p>It's a long shot. Nice try, but unlikely to work.</p>
