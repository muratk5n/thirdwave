on its merry way to Venezuella... Nimitz, compared to previous week,
appears to be pulled off from the "Iranian Theater", it is now in the

<p>Pettis, <em>Trade Wars are Class Wars</em>, 2020: "There is no guaranteed way
to identify the origin of an imbalance, but market prices can provide
clues.. The current account deficit country is..  the likely source of
the imbalance if its interest rates rise (or the international value
of its assets goes down) as its external financing need rises. This is
a frequent phenomenon for countries on the periphery of the
international financial system.</p>
<p>Consider Turkey over the past few years. Between 2010 and 2018, the
country went on an investment binge funded by borrowing from
abroad. Turkey’s current account deficit was consistently worth about
6 percent of its domestic income. This boosted output at the cost of
rising debt.  Attracting foreign money to cover this excess of
spending over income required persistent currency depreciation beyond
what would have been implied by differences in inflation: the real
value of the Turkish lira fell by half between 2010 and the middle of
2018. Unsurprisingly, foreign savers grew increasingly skeptical of
Turkey and mostly lent in debt that could only be repaid with
U.S. dollars, not Turkish lira. (Think of Argentina’s
nineteenth-century gold-backed debts.)</p>
<p>Interest rates also had to rise. The cost of a dollar-denominated
business loan rose from about 4 percent in 2010 to 6 percent by the
second half of 2018. Over the same period, interest rates on
lira-denominated ​business loans soared from 9 percent to 28
percent. Eventually, foreign revulsion with Turkish assets slashed
Turkish spending power, which in turn forced Turks to cut their
consumption and investment to the point that they moved into a current
account surplus by the middle of 2019."</p>
