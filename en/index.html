<p>Houston Chronicle: "Spacecraft company SpaceX and its contractors are
overdue on bills from builders and suppliers for work done in South
and Central Texas. It’s led to dozens of outstanding liens since

<p>EFF: "Big Tech to EU: 'Drop Dead'.. The European Union's new Digital
Markets Act (DMA).. aims to make it easier for the public to control
the technology they use and rely on... DMA is meant to push us toward
a world where you decide which software runs on your devices, where
it's easy to find the best products and services, where you can leave
a platform for a better one without forfeiting your social
relationships, and where you can do all of this without getting spied
on.</p>
<p>If it works, this will get dangerously close to better future we've
spent the past thirty years fighting for. There's just one wrinkle:
the Big Tech companies don't want that future, and they're trying
their damndest to strangle it in its cradle"</p>

smart people somewhere really <em>are</em> figuring out a solution, while
rich and powerful people are figuring out ways to shut them up"</p>
