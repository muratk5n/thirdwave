<p>Forbes: "Hydrogen Crane Deployment At The Port Of Los Angeles.. The
Port of Los Angeles will serve as one of the primary locations for the
ARCHESH2 projects, known as the California Hydrogen Hub, which was
recently designated by the Department of Energy. The California
hydrogen hub is expected to receive a substantial amount of funding,
up to $1.2 billion from DOE, facilitating an overall investment of up
to 15 billion in hydrogen technologies. Pioneering projects like
PACECO's hydrogen-powered crane are indicative of the exciting
deployments to come in decarbonizing ports in Los Angeles and reducing
pollution in the region as a whole"</p>

<p>After "the deluge" the BEV makers probably won't be completely
crushed. They have powertrain technology, they can simply swap out the
battery with H2 gas tank, connect it to their powertrain, power the
electric motor that way. All their efforts were not in vain, but they
cannot stay around in their current form and expect not to be (partly)
crushed. They bet on an inferior technology. There will be a price to
pay.</p>

<p>Cyberscoop: "Microsoftâ€™s Recall puts the Biden administrationâ€™s cyber

<p>The statement below assumes extracted carbon = newly deposed carbon
which cancels out, we get net zero. But after carbon is extracted to
make synthetic methane, the produced methane needs to be tracked
seperately from carbon, methane is its own GHG, 20 times more potent
than carbon. The budgeting makes incorrect assumptions.</p>
<p>I am not a big fan of synthetic fuels made by recycling carbon. The
world needs the cleanest solution, in its purest form. We need to cut
the knot, like Alexander, not untie it. Attempting to extend existing
systems, like "the grid", or fossil fuels by supposedly making
synthetic versions of the latter while "being careful about their
carbon budgeting" will result in a fragile system and be too open to
cheating. Imagine the Volkswagen situation multiplied by 10. </p>

<p>"Combined with carbon extracted from the atmosphere, biomass or
industrial emissions, [we can produce] methane, synthetic oil,
ammonia, methanol or other net-zero-emissions fuels"</p>
