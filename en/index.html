<p>Ukraine keeps extending the frontline - incursion in Kursk, additional
areas west of it.. But I don't think it matters for Russia - it is
meat grinder work for them all the same, degrading Ukrainian forces,
so it is de-facto demilitarized.</p>

<p>Isaacson, <em>Einstein</em>: "By now the siren song of a unified theory had
come to mesmerize Einstein... On his steamer ride through Asia, he
polished a new paper and, upon arriving in Egypt in February 1923,
immediately mailed it to Planck in Berlin for publication. His goal,
he declared, was 'to understand the gravitational and electromagnetic
field as one.'  Once again, Einstein’s pronouncements made headlines
around the world.  'Einstein Describes His Newest Theory,' proclaimed
the New York Times.  But this approach led nowhere, just like the
others...</p>
<p>In the world of physics, where quantum mechanics was now accepted,
Einstein and his fitful quest for a unified theory were beginning to
be seen as quaint. But in the popular imagination, he was still a
superstar. The frenzy that surrounded the publication of his January
1929 five-page paper, which was merely the latest in a string of
theoretical stabs that missed the mark, was astonishing. Journalists
from around the world crowded around his apartment building, and
Einstein was barely able to escape them to go into hiding at his
doctor’s villa on the Havel River outside of town. The New York Times
had started the drumbeat weeks earlier with an article headlined
'Einstein on Verge of Great Discovery: Resents Intrusion.'.. </p>
<p>Even before his little paper was published, he gave an interview about
it to a British newspaper. 'It has been my greatest ambition to
resolve the duality of natural laws into unity,' he said. “The purpose
of my work is to further this simplification, and particularly to
reduce to one formula the explanation of the gravitational and
electromagnetic fields. For this reason I call it a contribution to ‘a
unified field theory’... Now, but only now, we know that the force
that moves electrons in their ellipses about the nuclei of atoms is
the same force that moves our earth in its annual course around the
sun.' Of course, it turned out that he did not know that, nor do we
know that even now.</p>
<p>When [the paper] was released on January 30.. The New York Herald
Tribune decided to print the entire paper verbatim, but it had trouble
figuring out how to cable all the Greek letters and symbols over
telegraph machines.  So it hired some Columbia physics professors to
devise a coding system and then reconstruct the paper in New York,
which they did. The Tribune’ s colorful article about how they
transmitted the paper was a lot more comprehensible to most readers
than Einstein’s paper itself. The New York Times, for its part, raised
the unified theory to a religious level by sending reporters that
Sunday to churches around the city to report on the sermons about
it. 'Einstein Viewed as Near Mystic,' the headline declared...</p>
<p>Theologians and journalists may have been wowed, but physicists were
not. Eddington, usually a fan, expressed doubts. Over the next year,
Einstein kept refining his theory and insisting to friends that the
equations were 'beautiful.'  But he admitted to his dear sister that
his work had elicited 'the lively mistrust and passionate rejection of
my colleagues.'  Among those who were dismayed was Wolfgang
Pauli.</p>
<p>[Later] he turned his attention to yet another revised approach that
would make more headlines but not more headway in solving the great
riddle he had set for himself. 'Einstein Completes Unified Field
Theory,' the New York Times reported on January 23, 1931, with little
intimation that it was neither the first nor would it be the last time
there would be such an announcement. And then again, on October 26 of
that year: 'Einstein Announces a New Field Theory.'.. And so it went,
for another two decades. None of Einstein’s offerings ever resulted in
a successful unified field theory"</p>
<hr />
<p>After he arrived to America they turned him into a celebrity, that
probably did not help his work... He'd made a mistake with GR and that
mistake became entrenched, not reversed, to top it off the next
generation of scientists would try to connect with that broken theory
rather than go back to drawing board and try something else.
Einstein's undeserved celebrity status and US culture's treatment /
expectation of science held back fundamental research for nearly a
century now.</p>
