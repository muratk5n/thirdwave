<p>PJ Onori: "Itâ€™s 2025. Read.cv is shutting down. WordPress is on
fire. Twitter has completely melted down. Companies are changing their
content policies en masse. Social networks are becoming increasingly
icy towards anything outside of their walled garden. Services are
using the content you post to feed proprietary LLMs. Government
websites appear to be purging data. Itâ€™s a wild time.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s hard to know where this bottoms out. And those who rely on these
services are just along for the ride. Web 2.0 seemed like such a great
idea in a more innocent time. Weâ€™re at a point where itâ€™s only prudent
to view third-parties as guilty until proven innocent. Not as some
abstract, principled stance, but for our own direct benefit.</p>
<p>Now, more than ever, itâ€™s critical to own your data. Really own
it. Like, on your hard drive and hosted on your website. Ideally on
your own server, but one step at a time"</p>

<p>"Scraping" is the term used for the kind of code that fetches a Web

part of it, like scraping the outer paint off a wall, you see?</p>
