<p>Meanwhile, the old Irish duopoly also stumbles, with Fianna Fáil and
Fine Gael polling at 17% and 18% respectively, and the broad-left

<p>Xi's "princeling status" is lower than some of the other princelings?
I don't think so. Let's think CCP history, after the "Long March" Mao
went to Yan'an, the Red Army was in a bad shape, who gave them refuge?
Xi Jinping's father. That is some legendary stuff right there.</p>

<p>The CCP party conf is over, the result seems to be Xi lives to fight
another day, but according to the infighting scenario power is still
divided.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Epoch Times: "Gen. Zhang Shengmin, a veteran political commissar,
was officially promoted on Oct. 23 to the post of second-ranked vice
chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) agency that controls the armed forces.. The
newly appointed vice chair of the CMC appears not to belong to a
political faction loyal to Xi.. This contrasts with his direct
predecessor, He, who was described by some China observers as Xi’s
No. 1 confidant in the military."</p>
<hr />
<p>The Epoch Times: "Xi’s Power Tested as 7 Officials Snubbed in CCP
Leadership Shuffle.. One of the most striking signs was the quiet
sidelining of seven alternate Central Committee members who were
passed over for promotion—a rare move in party protocol that may
signal their political downfall. The omissions, which include some of
Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s longtime allies from the military and his
home province of Shaanxi, point to intensifying internal conflict"</p>

Over the weekend, a group of armed Israeli settlers in the West Bank

the attack, he was told that his own government could not protect him."</p>

<p>If Ukraine falls Poland can take its Western section that are
"historically Polish", and Hungary can probably take Transcarpathia -
there is a Hungarian speaking minority there, and it is right across
the border, right? It can happen... RU beats it, and UA becomes a rump
state its neighbors dismember it. </p>
