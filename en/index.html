<p>Happy Past January 6. Insurrectionists: be better prepared next time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Obviously serious researchers seeking alternatives means human level
AI will not be reached via existing approaches. They are just wasting
energy, creating bunch of junk.</p>
<hr />
<p>I would call the empty-patch approach supervised learning, it
seemingly does not require labels, but the labels are generated from
the data itself. Clustering, PCA are unsupervised, at a fundamental
level. </p>
<hr />
<p>New "AI" idea is working on a layered architecture where vision based
training starts first, a net is trained by taking out patches from
real-world images, and machinery tries to predict those empty
patches. That way the necessary internal connections are formed
representing the outside world, visually, then other learning is
layered on top...</p>
<p>Will motor function be part of that training? A big part of how we
learn the world is tied to how we move in it. When I take a big step
vs small one, I see certain visual changes in the outside world (far
points move little, near ones a lot), that is part of my understanding
of the outside world.</p>

<p>Bloomberg: "NTPC’s Clean Energy Arm to Build $21 Billion Green
Hydrogen Hub..  The clean energy unit of NTPC Ltd., India’s largest
thermal power producer, is developing a green hydrogen hub at an
estimated cost of 1.8 trillion rupees (21 billion dollars) as the
country seeks to add more carbon-free fuel to meet its needs"</p>
<hr />
<p>As easy sources of oil become depleted, more risky, harder to drill
areas will be tried... That means more oil spills. Expect more
frequent occurences of such events.</p>

<p>Why did Trump do it? Voters, politicians of all stripes in those
states like it. </p>
<hr />
<p>WaPo: "[2020] In reversal, Trump to ban oil drilling off coasts of
Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.. The move comes after the White
House previously proposed a huge expansion of drilling off
U.S. coasts. Democratic and Republican governors have resisted
offshore oil exploration"</p>
<hr />
<p>CleanTechnica: "[Another admin] cannot simply undo [an environmental]
EO with a countermanding order.. [such EOs are] similar to other
permanent protective orders issued by Republican and Democratic
presidents alike under the authority of the 1953 Outer Continental
Shelf Lands Act, including Dwight Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush"</p>
<hr />
<p>AP News: "Biden issues ban on offshore oil and gas drilling in most
federal waters."</p>
