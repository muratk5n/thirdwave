<p>"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Earth’s lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.</p>
<p>Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"</p>

<p>He is in treasuries obviously, not cash cash. The amount is staggering
isn't it, this is all government debt. There is money, accumulated
somewhere, and it can easily buy that government debt. Gov spends
spends, rich buys buys. Governments gradually lose assets, lose income
bcz they don't tax, and they will fall furter in debt eventually they
will cut services.</p>

<p>Wealth won't trickle down, it will just sit there accruing interest,
that's why it has to be taxed.</p>
<p>Ludwig, <em>The Vanishing American Dream</em>: [I]n 2018.. [a]mid a raft of
seemingly very positive economic indicators — a low unemployment rate,
strong GDP growth, buoyant market benchmarks — I had concluded that
too few policymakers were taking heed of the fact that many
communities were being left behind. Too frequently, Washington
insiders seemed sanguine that wealth accruing at the top of the income
scale would eventually 'trickle down' to the rest of the country. A
closer look at localities like the place where I grew up—York,
Pennsylvania—revealed that thinking to be entirely off base"</p>
