<p><em>Careless People</em>: "Just a few weeks after [Joel Kaplan] takes over
[the Facebook global public policy, 2011] job, Joel starts hiring a
political sales team to push politicians—here and abroad—into becoming
advertisers. The idea is, if politicians depend on Facebook to win
elections, they’ll be less likely to do anything that’ll harm
Facebook. If Facebook is the goose that lays the golden egg, no one
wants to kill the goose. Get them hooked on those golden eggs.</p>
<p>Political advertising is a way to change that. And elections are the
biggest opportunity. Fresh-faced Harvard grads start moving into the
Washington, DC, office to sell ads to politicians and political
campaigns.</p>
<p>I find this all repugnant. I feel alienated from this new regime from
the outset. As a foreigner, I have a very different perspective on
money in elections. New Zealand, like so many other countries, has
strict limits on electoral spending: under 27,500 New Zealand dollars
per candidate. I’m astounded at the role money plays in elections in
the US. It determines so much about whose voice gets heard on every
issue... I’m also against exporting this value system. But Facebook is
effectively bringing this in globally by stealth"</p>

<p>[Cost to recreate] is ~$4.15B, but demand-side (value to firms) is
  8.8T dollars [yes that's a <em>trillion</em>]. Shows massive cost savings &amp;
  productivity boost from OSS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If OSS didn't exist, firms would need to spend an estimated 3.5
  times more on software than they currently do. OSS provides a
  massive, often invisible, productivity boost...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firms should not just "free ride" on OSS but actively contribute to
  the ecosystem, as this is far cheaper than recreating the software
  themselves"</p>

<p>I'd love to see US excommunicated from everything, coupled with a
reverse brain drain and total ban against their products,
esp. military. They are supporting terrorism (Zionist expansionism)
and their support for free speech is in duldrums, see the Mahmoud
Khalil case.</p>

<p>Wynn-Williams, <em>Careless People</em>: "Facebook had planned to launch a
Facebook for children codenamed 'Project Family,' and Sheryl
[Sandberg] would occasionally remind the policy team of their 'failure
to do this while we had the opportunity,' blaming the policy team for
missing the chance to get kids on Facebook but she, like most of the
leaders at Facebook with younger children, severely limits her kids’
access to screens, let alone social media accounts. And she never
shares images of her children on social media. Silicon Valley is awash
in wooden Montessori toys and shrouded in total screen bans. Parents
at work talk about how they don’t allow their teens to have mobile
phones, which only underscores how well these executives understand
the real damage their product inflicts on young minds.</p>
