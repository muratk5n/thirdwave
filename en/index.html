<p>Summary: The US bombing of Serbs was a show, to cover up the Bosnian
concessions made to them later. I would not expect anything less from
a Clinton.</p>

<p>Some notes from Robert Masse's criticism of the Copenhagen
Interpretation of QM</p>

<p>Hinton, "the godfather of AI" is mostly talking out of his ass these
days.. What happened to one innovation of his, the so-called
"capsules"?  He had declared regular NN aproaches dead back in 2017
and was promoting it ad nauseam, capsules, that would revolutionize
everything... it didn't go anywhere. His best days are clearly behind
him. He is a just a rambling man now.. talking crazy.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Long considered a system reserved for insiders, Linux is experiencing
a real boom in France. According to an analysis.. based on web traffic
data published by Cloudflare Radar, more than 2.2 million French
people regularly use Linux on their personal computers"</p>
<hr />
<p>It needs to be stressed, LLMs operate in a "latent space", in the
compressed knowledge representation of the world, and when asked
something they can <em>always</em> generate something from that latent
space. I can factorize a matrix $A$ into various components even with
missing data, get a "reduced dimension" representation, and always
recreate the whole matrix from those components even fill in the
missing values whether the prediction is completely right or not. The
generation can be close, but not always necessarily accurate. This is
what they mean when the hallucination is embedded in the math.</p>
<hr />
<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a good idea.. you can have LLM index
your personal notes, personal documents (obviously orgs can do the
same on their internal knowledge base), just like LLMs indexed the
whole Internet and books, they can just add your stuff on top of that,
then you can "ask", or query that knowledge base silo in plain
English.</p>
<hr />
<p>LLM is glorified search.. LLMs are ok at that, I never said they
weren't, but remember for regular search we don't expect perfection,
or crazy accuracy, simply the top 10 or 20 items be relevant, same is
true here.</p>

inevitable, not just engineering flaws"</p>

<p>The Guardian: "About 5 million British computer users risk becoming
vulnerable to cyber-attacks and scams after Microsoft next week stops
updating its decade-old Windows 10 system, consumer campaigners have
warned.</p>
<p>One in four of an estimated 21 million UK people using a device that
runs the Windows 10 software intend to continue using it after updates
cease and so will be at risk of online security breaches including
malware and viruses..</p>
<p>The most straightforward move is to update to Windows 11 for free. If
your PC is less than four years old, it is likely to work [but some
hardware might not be enough to run 11] ...</p>
<p>Another solution is to convert your computer to a different operating
system, such as Linux or Googleâ€™s Chrome OS."</p>

<p>The actress is not Israeli herself, she is a chica. LatinX.</p>

<p>NCIS has a new spinoff, <em>NCIS Tony and Ziva</em>. The character Ziva is an
Israeli. Is this part of an attempt to make the Zio look good again?</p>

<p>Truth Social exists thanks to FOSS. They took their base code from
Mastodon. Every time Il Duce posts a message on TS he is expressing
how much he likes software socialism.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Internet boom of post 90s would be impossible if it had to rely on
Oracle, Microsoft commercial packages alone... Having a free software
stack as an alternative (now the main tech avenue) allowed many
projects to experiment with what worked what didn't, for
free. Startups did not immediately call up Jew Ellison to be charged
millions for gargentuan bloated Oracle database before they made any
money. They relied on open source, paid next to nothing for their
software stack.</p>
