<p>"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Earth’s lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.</p>
<p>Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"</p>

<p>Where are the shit commercial codes, like Windows based ones?
Micro$haft tried to compete in this space but it had its ass handed to
it. FOSS coding is simply better. The code is free and open, more eyes
look at it, anyone can contribute an improvement, or test.</p>

<p>SA is likely serious on their position, bcz Palestinians were ignored

<p>Sky News: "Riyadh has swiftly responded to Trump's comments, hardening
its position and insisting on Palestinian statehood in exchange for a
deal. That's not going to happen either... And so, are these faux
lines of negotiation being drawn? Artificial problems being created to
give the sides the spectre of something to climb down from?"</p>
