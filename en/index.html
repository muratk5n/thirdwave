<p>Government officials are worried about tiktok radicalizing young
people but I think calling in a militarized police force against their
friends who are peacefully protesting a genocide will probably do it"</p>
<hr />
<p>Getting slammed by North Korea - a new low. There is a lot of truth in
what they say.</p>
<p>TASS: "The situation in Ukraine serves the interests of the US
military-industrial complex and the administration of President Joe
Biden, both profiting greatly from the conflict, North Korean Deputy
Foreign Minister for Russia Im Chon Il said. '..at least a third of
the $60 billion US military aid to Ukraine remains in the US to
replenish the army's equipment and ammunition. This once again
blatantly reveals the cunning and despicable nature of the 'helping
hand' the US offers to Ukraine with its military aid. Its goal is to
use the Ukrainian conflict to serve the interests of the US military
monopolies and at the same time to subjugate the puppet regime of
[Ukrainian President Vladimir] Zelensky to use it as a conduit and
henchman for the implementation of its strategy to contain Russia,'
the diplomat said in a statement quoted by the Korean Central News
Agency.</p>
<p>'It is not surprising that experts assess that it is the US that is
reaping the maximum benefit from the situation in Ukraine, and the
Biden administration is drinking "blood wine" and receiving large
revenues,' the deputy foreign minister said"</p>
<hr />
<p>Advanced Science News: "Researchers from the University of Nottingham
have discovered that the surface of swarf, the waste metal ringlets
discarded by the metal machining industry, is textured at a nanoscale
level in a way that boosts the catalysis [for H2 electrolysis]
reducing the need for rare metals.</p>
<p>The authors of the study, published in the Journal of Material
Chemistry A, claim it overcomes two major challenges. “Firstly, it
enables the production of green hydrogen using the least amount of
precious metal possible, and secondly, it upcycles metal waste from
the aerospace industry, all in a single process,” said one of the
study’s authors, Andrei Khlobystov"</p>

<p>Rowan Atkinson, The Guardian: "[2023/06] Electric motoring is, in
theory, a subject about which I should know something. My first
university degree was in electrical and electronic engineering, with a
subsequent master’s in control systems.. In advance of the Cop26
climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, Volvo released figures claiming
that greenhouse gas emissions during production of an electric car are
nearly 70% higher than when manufacturing a petrol one. How so? The
problem lies with the lithium-ion batteries fitted currently to nearly
all electric vehicles: they’re absurdly heavy, huge amounts of energy
are required to make them, and they are estimated to last only upwards
of 10 years. It seems a perverse choice of hardware with which to lead
the automobile’s fight against the climate crisis...</p>
<p>If the lithium-ion battery is an imperfect device for electric cars,
concerns have been raised over their use in heavy trucks for long
distance haulage because of the weight; an alternative is to inject
hydrogen into a new kind of piston engine. JCB, the company that makes
yellow diggers, has made huge strides with hydrogen engines and hopes
to put them into production in the next couple of years. If hydrogen
wins the race to power trucks – and as a result every filling station
stocks it – it could be a popular and accessible choice for cars...</p>
<p>Increasingly, I’m feeling that our honeymoon with electric cars is
coming to an end, and that’s no bad thing: we’re realising that a
wider range of options need to be explored if we’re going to properly
address the very serious environmental problems that our use of the
motor car has created"</p>

<p>I dont think it's his fault. The tech is crooked</p>
<p>Yahoo News: "[2024/02] Rowan Atkinson blamed for poor electric car sales"</p>
<hr />
<p>Euronews: "Car sales in Europe decline: Is the future of electric vehicles at stake?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Reuters: "[2024/01] Tesla slashes electric car range amid claims it
exaggerated mileage.. Tesla has cut back claims about how far its
electric cars can travel as it faces scrutiny from the US government."</p>
<hr />
<p>I think this is what the private complex, the surface state is afraid
of.. You can't question militarism - it's a product. Do you question a
burger? That's crazy talk!</p>
<p>Wapo: "[2023/11] On Monday, a TikTok user with 371 followers, using
the screen name '_monix2,' posted a video where she read parts of
Osama bin Laden’s 'Letter to America,'..  By Wednesday night, the
letter had become a point of discussion among left-wing creators on
the video app, with some saying its critiques of American foreign
policy had opened their eyes to a history they’d never learned"</p>

<p>"Holocaust Survivor Message to US Campus Protesters:</p>
<p>This survivor of the Holocaust is against Genocide in Gaza &amp;
conflating Jewishness with Zionism, which does nothing but increase
antisemitism.</p>
<p>Your protests are so persistent, large and global that eventually the
Western leadership, which are trying to deny what’s going on, will be
forced to face up to it.</p>
<p>There is a historic responsibility towards injustice, genocide and
fascism.</p>
<p>Thank you for being brave and on the right side of history.</p>
