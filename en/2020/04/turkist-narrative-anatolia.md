# Turkist Narrative, Culture

People have an Asia Minor do have a culture, but they name that
culture incorrectly. The migrants who arrived in Anatolia melted away,
assimilated into, and became part of the larger culture they arrived
in. Their effect was minimal, proportional to their size [1]. Current
narrative has them arriving, finding the place empty [4], and
remaining as they were for a thousand years, bringing "civilization"
to Anatolia.

I estimate the arrival of new ppl starting from 600s and continuing
for a few centuries seems to be around 1 million arriving into a
population of 8 million.

Genetic research proves [2] biologically only 9% of genetic structure
(95% CI 7-11) of today's Anatolia is of Asiatic origin. Culture effects
are always proportional with size, 90% of the culture of today's culture
in non-Turkic.

A new label is needed, one is not as retarded and full of misinformation
as the one in use now.

### Similarities

Food

Organized agriculture was invented in Anatolia and its nearby regions,
over 10,000 years ago ("Turk" migration is little over 1000 yrs
old). So it should be no surprise inventions around food, tasty
recipes, preservation methods were first invented there, not by nomads.

<a name='yogurt'/>

Yogurt was invented in the Mediterrenian region, Herodotus talks about
it in the 5th century B.C. 

The Turkish coffee is a Yemenese invention. I'm talking about using
coffee beans ground into a fine powder, then boiled in a little [brass pot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FB9mjc0XMAU_YNS?format=jpg&name=small).
This product is called different names by countries, with many laying
claim on its discovery. But since the first-use was in Yemen, it should
be called Yemenese coffee.

Asia Minor *tarhana* soup is actually one of the oldest foods in the
Eastern Mediterranean called in Greek *trahana*, it was traditionally
made in August as an ingenious method of preserving milk for the cold
winter months by combining the dairy with the wheat and leaving in the
hot summer sun to dry over a few days.

*Döner* (meaning 'it turns') is similar to Greek *gyro*, Arabic
*shawarma*, or Armenian *tarna* (which literally means *to turn*)
are all variations of the same idea that were served all over the place in
Eastern Europe and Middle East, for thousands of years.

Music

Below is Byzantine music which sounds awefully similar to "Turkish art
music", *sanat müziği*.

### Why the Subterfuge

The reasons are many.

- The collapse of the empire required an identity-rethink: the
collapse was blamed on back-stabbing neighbors, and the ancient
locals. The unblemished migrant (who was ignored, taken advantage of
by others) had to be brought to the fore, in order to create a new
republic.

- The last dominant sultan led a pan-Islam policy, the officers who
rose up against him and later founding the Republic wanted to rock'n
roll, they made the pure, unblemished migrant also a non-Islamic,
shamanistic person. They would achive secularism indirectly, now
the Turk had something he was connected to before Islam, and
the narrative had the double side effect of ignoring the religion
of the region, especially of the "backstabbers".

- Turk always meant Muslim in the Balkans, for recent migrants from
Balkans who were Muslim this identity wasn't too off-putting. But per
above founders pushed Islam in the background, creating a
contradiction.

- The identity worked best for migrants who had truly arrived
recently, Circassians, Tatars, and others. In the case of Tatars the
identity worked even better - they looked Asiatic. However as the
"scratch a Tatar you get a Russian" comment suggests the newly
arrivals weren't exactly Turkic, then they assimilated into Anatolia
which wasn't Turkic either. Their story became another tragic example
of labeling gone wrong.

- Ever-present Russian danger necessitated strong allies. Britain was
such an ally. Britain always fought against Russia in The Great Game,
they wanted a bulwark against them. The "Turk" who is unblemished
therefore still connected to Asia who could stir up trouble there
among other Turkic nations causing trouble for Russia was a God-sent
for Brits. In this narrative the nomadic Turk who is foreign to this
"new land" could be the perfect frontier infantry, always ready to
attack Russia or whoever causes trouble for him (creating additional
animonsiities which could be exploited such as in Cyprus) with the
chaos potential reaching all the way into Central Asia, Caucuses, and
even Xinjang.

- Old neighbors becoming enemies reinforced the narrative. As all good
Ponzi schemes go, the narrative allowed a way in for everyone,
bizarrely constructed as it was, if one said you were it, you could
become it. But the story, rationalization of the identity had gone so
beyond odd, most of the notable "other" natives found it absurd, and
would never accept it. They were demonized for this reason, Kurds were
labeled as being "mountain Turks" for example who just did not know
what they truly were, since they were this stupid they could be jailed
or killed. Attacks toward other "non-Turks" also increased. Opression
led to rebellion, which caused Kurds to see themselves more and more
distinct. Now, sadly, even some Kurds want Turks to be Turks - because
it reinforces their seperatist wishes, them being a seperate Kurd.

- Same dynamic worked with Greeks - surely a people of Christian
denomination, but in cultural matters, especially in Anatolia, that
matters little. However the War of Independence caused the two people
to demonize eachother, now they also need the other to be what they
are so they can tell themselves fairy tales about hordes coming in
from wherever causing terror in the lands therefore one must be
on guard to protect the Greek nation at all times.

<a name='islamoturkist'/>

- After the 80 fascist coup the narrative was expanded to include
Islam. But the Islamoturkist Synthesis was also strategically crafted
to fit the needs of the US, Brits and the outer alliance in
general. In the 80s Islamist Mujaheddin was fighting in Afghanistan
against the Godless Soviets, religion was needed now, it was back en
vogue in Pakistan, and neighboring countries as well. However this
synthesis increased the internal inconsistencies of the Turkist
narrative even further. What Founder Kemal ignored was back, according
to earlier story the Turk was a shaman, now a bizarre combo was being
offered. Expansionist Ottomans were now good along with its Khalif, in
opposition to non-expansionist secular Republic. The reception of the
synthesis was lukewarm, older city Anatolians brought up by the old
system continued to believe in it, new ones pushed and pulled it into
bizarre new directions, making it into everything, which implied
previously already defective narrative now also meant nothing.

<a name='antiislamo'/>

- The 80s coup leaders, while creating an Islamoturkist Synthesis,
also "activated" the Turkist, Kemalist crowd alerting them to be "on
guard" against the other elements of the Synthesis who might misbehave
and do things secular folk might not like.. This act ushered in
decades of internal conflict in an Anatolian version of US culture
war, ignore the economic issues, just fight over hijab, "women's
rights". Well-to-do Turkist Kemalist would fight to force women to
take off their hijab, whereas conservative from usually poorer
background tried to "defend their identity" by refusing.. This fight
partly helped helped to cover up the excesses of the go-go years of
late 80s and the 90s, as an added bonus, also helped to cover the
crooked foundation of the Republic even longer. The work here [5]
talks about the symbolism aspects of the Kemalist resurgence 
post 80s.
