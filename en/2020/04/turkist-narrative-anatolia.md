# Turkist Narratives, Culture

People have an Asia Minor do have a culture, but they name that
culture incorrectly with the T-word. The migrants who arrived in
Anatolia melted away, assimilated into, and became part of the larger
culture they arrived in. Their effect was minimal, proportional to
their size [1]. Current narrative has them arriving, finding the place
empty [4], and remaining as they were for a thousand years, bringing
"civilization" to Anatolia.

I estimate the arrival of new ppl into Asia Minor (Anatolia) starting
from 600s and continuing for a few centuries seems to be around 1
million arriving into a population of 8 million.

Genetic research proves [2] biologically only 9% of genetic structure
(95% CI 7-11) of today's Anatolia is of Asiatic origin. Culture effects
are always proportional with size, 90% of the culture of today's culture
in non-Turkic.

### Similarities

Food

Organized agriculture was invented in Anatolia and its nearby regions,
over 10,000 years ago ("Turk" migration is little over 1000 yrs
old). So it should be no surprise inventions around food, tasty
recipes, preservation methods were first invented there. 

Yogurt was invented in the Mediterrenian region, Herodotus talks about
it in the 5th century B.C. 

The Turkish coffee is a Yemenese invention. I'm talking about using
coffee beans ground into a fine powder, then boiled in a little [brass pot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FB9mjc0XMAU_YNS?format=jpg&name=small)
is called different names by countries, with many laying claim on its
invention. But that style of coffee making was first invented in Yemen; so it
should be called Yemenese coffee.

Asia Minor *tarhana* soup is actually one of the oldest foods in the
Eastern Mediterranean called in Greek *trahana*, it was traditionally
made in August as an ingenious method of preserving milk for the cold
winter months by combining the dairy with the wheat and leaving in the
hot summer sun to dry over a few days.

*Döner* (meaning 'it turns') is similar to Greek *gyro*, Arabic
*shawarma*, or Armenian *tarna* (literally means to turn) are all
variations of the same idea that were served all over the place in
Eastern Europe and Middle East, for thousands of years.

Music

Below is Byzantine music which sounds awefully similar to "Turkish art
music", (*sanat müziği*).

### Why the Subterfuge

The reasons are many.

Foundation

- The collapse of the empire required an identity-rethink: the
collapse was blamed on back-stabbing neighbors, and the ancient
locals. The unblemished migrant (who was ignored, taken advantage of
neighbors, and ancient locals) had to be brought to the fore,
in order to create a new republic. The founders did not know how
culture works. 

- The last dominant sultan led a pan-Islam policy, the officers who
rose up against them and later founding the Republic wanted to rock'n
roll, they made the pure, unblemished migrant also a non-Islamic,
shamanistic person. This was their foray into secularism.

- Turk always meant Muslim in the Balkans, for recent migrants from
Balkans who were Muslim this identity wasn't too off-putting (but
founders pushed Islam in the background, creating a contradiction).

- Ever-present Russian danger necessitated strong allies. Britain was
such an ally. Britain always fought against Russia in The Great Game,
they wanted a bulwark against them. The "Turk" who is unblemished
therefore still connected to Asia who could stir up trouble there
among other Turkic nations causing trouble for Russia was a God-sent
gift for them.
