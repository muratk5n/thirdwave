# Are Black People a Monolith?

It may not be politically correct, but so what if blacks act this way
for serious political reasons. See [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/why-black-voters-will-vote-biden/592573)

"There are good reasons why, even in Democratic presidential primary
campaigns, large majorities of black voters do end up supporting the
same candidate.Political solidarity is not an innate characteristic of
black America; it is a survival tactic that adverse experience has
reinforced time and time again. Chattel slavery and Jim Crow paid
little mind to the specific talents, abilities, and aspirations of
each black person. Simply being a member of the race was sufficient to
be disenfranchised and oppressed. Black Americans have been made
acutely aware that their individual fates are linked to the wellbeing
of the whole group"
