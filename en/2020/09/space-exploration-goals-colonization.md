# Space Exploration Goals, Human Colonization

Venus

<a name='venus'/>

Venus is relatively close, has the right gravity and its upper atmo,
with the proper engineering, can be made habitable.

NASA has been clearly thinking about this possibility, with its High
Altitude Venus Operational [Concept](https://sacd.larc.nasa.gov/smab/havoc/):
"The upper atmosphere of Venus, with similar pressure, density, gravity,
and radiation protection to that of the surface of the earth, is relatively
benign at 50 km. A lighter-than-air vehicle could carry either a host of instruments and
probes, or a habitat and ascent vehicle for a crew of two astronauts
to explore Venus for up to a month. Such a mission would require less
time to complete than a crewed Mars mission"

Great idea but a new name with a different acronym than HAVOC might be
called for, I propose **L**evitating **A**irbor**N**e **DO**me -
LANDO, also the name of a character in *Star Wars*, the leader of a
floating city.

O'Neill Cylinders

Informative tweet storm

<blockquote width="340" class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So today we&#39;re talking about O&#39;Neill Cylinders! Space settlements have always been something straight out of sci-fi, but cool to talk about nonetheless.

Good thng about O'Neill Cylinders is that Earth-like gravity can be
created on them, and they can be built close to Earth. Jeff Bezos
talked about the idea at length at a presentation (apparently he was
once one of O'Neill's students)

Note the "planetary chauvinism" comment by Isaac Asimov.

Bezos is infrastructure-minded, talks about building the necessary
elements so more people, organizations can explore space, in the same
way he was able to build Amazon on elements that were available to him
when he started in the 90s.
