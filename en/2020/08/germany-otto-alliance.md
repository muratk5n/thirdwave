# Germany - Ottoman Alliance

No, German-"Otto" alliance was not the result of a single "unexpected"
event, organized by a small cadre through the
[bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sea_Raid) of a Russian
port. Otto had no other choice. See

>If the Germans had reasons to look glum in 1914, the Ottomans were
 even more justified to be disheartened. The Empire appeared in the
 process of dissolution... Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 had almost
 terminated Ottoman presence in South-Eastern Europe — which in some
 places had lasted well over 500 years. The Ottoman government was
 well aware that for much of the 19th century Great Power rivalry, not
 Ottoman military and diplomatic strength, had maintained the
 Empire. The reckoning was simple: as long as the “Concert of Europe”
 existed, in the sense of an equilibrium between the Great Powers, the
 Empire was reasonably safe. Should war break out, the future was
 bleak: regardless which camp (Triple Entente or Triple Alliance)
 would emerge victorious, the Empire’s days would be numbered: the
 victors would share the spoils among themselves. Thus it was vital
 for the Empire to conclude an alliance with a strong industrial and
 military power, which would serve as a protector after the war.

>Finding allies was easier said than done: the Empire seemed to have
 nothing to offer either economically or militarily. Russia declined
 the offer; France did likewise. Germany, however, accepted: alliance
 was concluded on August 2, 1914.

The reason wasn't an ideological similarity that all of a sudden
changed from one regime to the next either, just plain ol' need and
desparation..
