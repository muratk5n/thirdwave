Butkus et al: "[W]e found a significant U-shaped debt-growth link when
estimated in the sample of countries with to some extent similar
institutional quality as measured by government
effectiveness. However, counties with high (low) government
effectiveness can start facing negative impact at very different
ratios of public debt to GDP. Depending on estimation technique, debt
turning point varies from 46% to 229% and from 8% to 145% of GDP in
countries with respectively high and low government effectiveness.
Such extreme variation is sharply reduced if we take trade balance
into account. Relaying on the trade and budget deficit relationship
(“twin deficit” hypothesis) and expenditure multiplier effect, in this
paper we assume that besides government effectiveness, a trade balance
is another crucial factor determining debt threshold level. While
exact debt turning point still varies depending on estimation method,
when we consider both factors, that is, government effectiveness and
trade balance, all specifications confirm the main idea, that
countries with better quality of governance and lower level of trade
deficit have higher debt threshold level"

To summarize: you can't simply pull out money out of your ass and have
it be a positive effect on government level, there is a point the
trick loses its effect.

Sure crisis is a different situation.

US, as the printer of the world's reserve currency is a different
beast as well.

Noone is arguing not giving money to who needs it the most. If u
exceed the ceiling of debt effectiveness, then go to the rich, and tax
their ass.

"Oh but don't you know governments can print money for
themselves". Again, different for US. Everyone else has to worry about
inflation, and the price of their currency. We can't make coarse
statements about austerity, money printing wout refering to
thresholds, inst situation of each counntry.
