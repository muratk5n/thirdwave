# Crowd Wisdom

"At a country fair .. 800 people participated in a contest to estimate
the weight of a slaughtered and dressed ox. Statistician Francis
Galton observed that the median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate
within 1% of the true weight of 1198 pound"

It sounds magical, bunch of people seemingly throwing out numbers and
their average works. How come? Here is how. Humans already have
built-in knowledge about the visual-look-weight connection on many
items, so their guesses will be already close enough to the real
thing, with some noise associated. The distribution of that noise will
be bell-shaped (Gaussian). This is important, bcz if normally
distributed, averaging such guesses, even with erros, fixes the error.

This technique even works internally sometimes, it is called "the
wisdom of the crowd within". "[Researchers] asked participants for
point estimates of continuous quantities associated with general world
knowledge, such as '[w]hat percentage of the world's airports are in
the United States?' [then] half of the participants were immediately
asked to make a second, different guess in response to the same
question [..t]he average of a participant's two guesses was more
accurate than either individual guess"

"Can't we use the same idea for policy, like millions making policy?"

No. For judging the weight of something, we already have perhaps
inborn, at the very least life-long experience there... During our
lives we have handled, touched, carried things, so looking at an
object we can make weight guesses. The estimate will have noise but it
won't be far off from the truth which can be corrected
statistically. Policy is not something people are engaged in
daily. Which makes it a speciality. Averaging among specialists will
work, not among everyone.

The Mechanism of Averaging

To elaborate more on how consensus among (knowledgeable) people can
result in correct decisions.. Remember earlier we said 800 people
estimated the weight of an ox correctly. Statistician Francis Galton
observed that the median guess, 1207 pounds, was accurate within 1% of
the true weight. Magic.

The reason is, guesses have noise, the right kind of noise, around the
right answer. Averaging removes noise.

The noise distribution is bell-shaped, "normal" or a "Gaussian" (a
dist is the formulaic form of a histogram, occurence count, frequency).

Normal distribution is weird; it shows up everywhere. Take a group of ppl,
their height dist is normal.

Have someone shoot at a target, measure distance from each hit to
bulls eye, dist is normal.

Whenever many factors *contribute* to a thing, normality occurs.. bcz
sums of anything (random) approaches normal. And there are many things
like that in nature

Demo. Throw a 6-sided die 1000 times (numbers below are from software
generator), histogram rolls,

```python
import random
n = 1000; b = 6
rolls = [random.randint(1,6) for i in range(b*n)]
rolls = np.array(rolls)
plt.hist(rolls,bins=6)
plt.savefig('dice2.png')
```

Nearly uniform (not normal), all equal chance,

But if I sum every 6 die throws and histogram,

```python
rolls = [random.randint(1,6) for i in range(b*n)]
rolls = np.array(rolls).reshape(n,b)
s = np.sum(rolls,axis=1)
plt.hist(s,bins=12)
plt.savefig('dice1.png')
```

<img width="200" src="../../tweets/2021/dice1.png"/>

Bell shaped. Normal.

Why? Bcz more sums result in a 6 than 2. I can get 6 with
4+2,2+4,1+5,3+3,etc.. More chance to hit it. Very low, very high nums
are harder. Easy sums form the bulk in the middle.

Anyway; then, if shooting errors, weight guesses are `true value + normal noise`,
averaging removes noise, bcz average of zero-centered
Gaussian (which is noise) is zero. This is the magic.

(Height is normal of course.. many factors contribute to height. Some
ppl might have a fat ass, small back, others large back, skinny
ass. Large or small head.. All cld lead to same height)

Both shooting, and weight guessing involves knowledge / skill BTW,
very important. Good noise around bullseye means person knows how to
shoot.  Judging weight by naked eye is possible bcz we have innate
knowledge of weights of things, through evolution, and part of growing
up, so the noise is normal. Stat ppl know this, when they apply a
model to data, they determine whether it is good by looking at its
mistake, its "residual" (diff between model pred, and real data). If
resid is gaussian, they are happy. Bad models leave patterns in
data. When unskilled (or dumb) people eff up you know why. There is
pattern in their eff ups (usually due to some bias).
