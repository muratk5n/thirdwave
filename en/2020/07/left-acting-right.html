<h1>Left Acting Right</h1>
<p>After the fall of the Berlin Wall, with all that "euphoria", there was
no way US would not end up tilting to right especially since Reagan
and HW were seen who crushed the Soviets, two Republican presidents
(just like Democrats winning WWII gave their slant of governance
legitimacy). Afterwards left would go right, right would go insane,
<a href="../../2018/05/polarization.html">polarization</a> would increase.. on and
on.. This rightward shift pervaded everything. Why did Dems become
interventionist? Why did left start acting right on war too? See

<p>Dukakis was destroyed by that image. At least that was the conclusion
at the time. Reagan "the cowboy" along with HW had won the Cold War
and here is this guy looking like a wimp..  Clinton must have woved
never to be in that position..</p>
<p>This is the environment where Margaret Thatcher says "There Is No
Alternative", which is picked up by the liberal Ozal ("There Is No
Alternative To Us") to all the way to now where Merkel can repeat
similar ideas, which should not be too surprising, she is the product
of the fall of the Berlin Wall. </p>
