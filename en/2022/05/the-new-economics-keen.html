<h1>The New Economics</h1>
<p>Steve Keen</p>
<p><a name='moneycreate'/></p>
<p>The Bundesbank made [that] pronouncement in 2017.. It suffices to look
at the creation of (book) money as a set of straightforward accounting
entries to grasp that money and credit are created as the result of
complex interactions between banks, non-banks and the central
bank. And a bank’s ability to grant loans and create money has nothing
to do with whether it already has excess reserves or deposits at its
disposal...</p>
<p>Since then, Neoclassical textbooks have continued to teach the
Loanable Funds and Fractional Reserve Banking models of banking.. as
if there’s nothing wrong with teaching factually incorrect models – as
if the change from a model in which banks do not create money, to one
in which they do, makes no difference to macroeconomics.  However, the
fact that banks create money when they lend has an enormous impact on
macroeconomics, and models which pretend that banks don’t create money
are utterly inaccurate models of capitalism..</p>
