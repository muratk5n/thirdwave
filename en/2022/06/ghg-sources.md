Methane

"Today, about 60 percent of the methane in the atmosphere comes from
sources scientists think of as human caused...

Most of methane’s natural emissions come from a soggy source:
wetlands, which includes bogs. Many microbes are like mammals in that
they eat organic material and spit out carbon dioxide—but many that
live in still, oxygen-deprived spots like waterlogged wetland soils
produce methane instead, which then leaks into the atmosphere. Over
all, about a third of all the methane floating in the modern
atmosphere comes from wetlands"

"There are 1.4 billion cattle in the world, and that number is growing
as demand for beef and dairy increases; together with other grazing
animals, they contribute about 40 percent of the annual methane
budget..

Rice paddies are a lot like wetlands: When they’re flooded, they’re
filled with calm waters low in oxygen, which are a natural home for
methane-producing bacteria"
