# Ferming Over Farming, Lab-Grown Meat

Lab-grown food will soon destroy farming – and save the planet..

It sounds like a miracle, but no great technological leaps were
required. In a commercial lab on the outskirts of Helsinki, I watched
scientists turn water into food. Through a porthole in a metal tank, I
could see a yellow froth churning. It’s a primordial soup of bacteria,
taken from the soil and multiplied in the laboratory, using hydrogen
extracted from water as its energy source. When the froth was siphoned
through a tangle of pipes and squirted on to heated rollers, it turned
into a rich yellow flour...

This flour is not yet licensed for sale. But the scientists, working
for a company called Solar Foods, were allowed to give me some while
filming our documentary *Apocalypse Cow*.

"Ferming is the new farming"

"Wildtype is on a mission to create the “cleanest, most sustainable
seafood on the planet” – starting with salmon. Through 'cellular
agriculture', it’s creating 'sushi-grade' cuts of salmon by raising
cells from Pacific salmon in bioreactors, where they are programmed to
organise and mature in the same way that they would within the fish.

Aryé Elfenbein, cardiologist and co-founder of Wildtype, compares the
mechanics to that of a brewery. Not only will Wildtype salmon be
healthier for humans (it won’t contain any microplastics, mercury or
parasites) but it will be better for the planet, too, because it will
be produced in “closed, animal-free systems designed to keep fish in
the water and out of farms”. It will also be far less cruel"
