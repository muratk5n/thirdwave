# Ferming Over Farming, Lab-Grown Meat

Lab-grown food will soon destroy farming – and save the planet..

It sounds like a miracle, but no great technological leaps were
required. In a commercial lab on the outskirts of Helsinki, I watched
scientists turn water into food. Through a porthole in a metal tank, I
could see a yellow froth churning. It’s a primordial soup of bacteria,
taken from the soil and multiplied in the laboratory, using hydrogen
extracted from water as its energy source. When the froth was siphoned
through a tangle of pipes and squirted on to heated rollers, it turned
into a rich yellow flour...

This flour is not yet licensed for sale. But the scientists, working
for a company called Solar Foods, were allowed to give me some while
filming our documentary *Apocalypse Cow*.

"Ferming is the new farming"

"Wildtype is on a mission to create the “cleanest, most sustainable
seafood on the planet” – starting with salmon. Through 'cellular
agriculture', it’s creating 'sushi-grade' cuts of salmon by raising
cells from Pacific salmon in bioreactors, where they are programmed to
organise and mature in the same way that they would within the fish.

Aryé Elfenbein, cardiologist and co-founder of Wildtype, compares the
mechanics to that of a brewery. Not only will Wildtype salmon be
healthier for humans (it won’t contain any microplastics, mercury or
parasites) but it will be better for the planet, too, because it will
be produced in “closed, animal-free systems designed to keep fish in
the water and out of farms”. It will also be far less cruel"

Lab-grown Fat, Hoxton Farms

Cultivating animal fat for plant-based meat..

Hoxton Farms says plant-based meat alternatives are missing 'one
crucial ingredient': fat.. [S]tart-up Hoxton Farms is cultivating
animal fat for plant-based meat alternatives. What is the secret to
the duo’s competitive edge? Computational biology, the founders tell
FoodNavigator. The global meat market is worth some 1.3trn. The newer,
plant-based meat alternative market is valued around the 4.3bn
mark. Yet despite their sizeable values, entrepreneurs Ed Steele and
Dr Max Jamilly say both industries have serious flaws. “The global
meat market is broken. It’s killing us, it’s killing the planet,” ​said
Dr Jamilly.“2020 was a great example of how global food security is at
an all-time low.

Food supply is fragile and traditional intensive agriculture has a big
role in the spread of animal-borne disease, antibiotic resistance, and
its enormous impact on climate.​ ​While demand for plant-based meat
alternatives is soaring – MarketsandMarkets expects the sector to be
worth $8.3bn by 2025 – the duo firmly believes that plant-based meat
alternatives still aren’t good enough. "And that’s because it is
missing this one crucial ingredient, which is fat.” ​Dr Jamilly told
FoodNavigator. "And that’s where we come in." ​The plant oil problem:
"Nobody wants a burger that tastes of coconut". ​The duo's start-up,
Hoxton Farms, makes cell-based animal fat. Its initial goal is to sell
its cultivated offering to plant-based meat companies as a replacement
of vegetable oil.

In doing so, industry can finally replace plant oils and create meat
alternatives that 'look, cook and taste just as good as the real
thing', said Dr Jamilly, 'if not better'. So what is Hoxton Farms'
beef with plant-based oils?

According to the co-founder, plant-based oils can be detrimental to
the environment and underperform on taste and functionality. “People
have been trying to get plant oils to perform like animal fat for over
150 years, since the French invented margarine, and we haven’t gone
far beyond that in the intervening time. The problem is that plant
oils are very bad for the environment – unsustainably sourced palm oil
and coconut oil in particular – and they have the wrong taste," ​said
Dr Jamilly. "... Plant oils have a low melting temperature, which can
make the finished product greasy rather than juicy, says Hoxton
Farms. From a functionality perspective, Hoxton Farms also find plant
oils lacking. "Their melting temperature is very low, which means that
if the fat hasn’t melted out of the product on the supermarket
shelves, then it definitely does when you put it in the pan or the
oven," ​the co-founder continued. This can result in a greasy, rather
than juicy, sensation. "And that’s not to mention the health impact of
plant oils, and the fact that to cover up their taste, plant-based
meat contains a huge amount of salt and other flavourings."..

Hoxton Farms' response to these ‘unsatisfactory’ plant-based fats is
to do somewhat of a U-turn and focus on animal fats. "Animal fats,
because of their structure and chemical properties, have a much better
melting temperature which makes them really juicy. They also have a
better taste, and that’s what we’re trying to deliver," explained Dr
Jamilly.

Rather than use plant oils, which the co-founder described as a ‘dodgy
substitute’, Hoxton Farms suggests food makers use its cultivated
animal fat. “It’s a product we know and love, and is the most
important sensory component of the meat we eat. ​“But we’re producing
it with none of the ethical or environmental hang-ups of traditional
meat.”​ Hoxton Farms' first product is a versatile cultured fat
intended for a variety of products. What is particularly exciting
about the technology, fellow co-founder Steele explained, is its
ability to meet customisation demands. "By feeding the fat cells
something different, we can get them to essentially create different
fats inside the cells. This means that we end up with different
flavours and taste compositions, for example, or different nutritional
profiles, densities, and melting properties" – all of which are really
important to plant-based meat companies.

Why Mission Barns believes cultivated fat is the key to better
plant-based meat In taste tests, CEO Eitan Fischer said more than 90%
of consumers preferred meat analogs made with cultivated fat over
plant equivalents...

Fischer thinks the public is ready for Mission Barns’ cultivated
fat. He first got involved in cultivated meat after he realized that
although people care about sustainability and animal cruelty when it
comes to food, they still want to eat what they want to eat.

As he thought about what products to create through cell cultivation
technology, Fischer considered the areas that no other companies had
been working on in the space...

All of those questions, he said, pointed at animal fat as the
answer. Fat cells grow more quickly than those for muscles, Fischer
said. Unlike muscle cells cultivated for meat cuts, which need a
precise amount of amino acids and other nutrients, fat cells can grow
on much cheaper nutrients like sugars. Fat cells don’t need to be in
any sort of defined shape or format, unlike meat cuts. And, Fischer
added, fat cells just like “to sit there and accumulate more and more
mass really quickly. We could grow, we believe, fat about 10x more
efficiently than muscle,” Fischer said. “And so for that reason, we
think we will have 10 times as much product and we’ll be at cost
parity 10 times faster.”

Only one other large company in this space is making cell-based fat:
Peace of Meat, which is a part of MeaTech 3D. The company is working
to scale up with a 21,530-square-foot plant under construction in its
home country of Belgium that is slated to begin operation next
year. Last month, Peace of Meat signed a joint development agreement
to provide avian cultured fat for the chicken analog products of
European mycoprotein-based meat maker Enough.

[The company's] first plant to produce their juicy holy grail will be
set in the Belgian city of Antwerp, where Peace of Meat is located
since 2019. In late 2021, the wholly own Belgian subsidiary was able
to produce a 700 gram jar of chicken fat biomass in a single
production cycle: “I think the decisions that we've made in the very
beginning to select a very specific cell type that nobody else was
using and nobody else is still using in the culture meatspace has
proven a good decision,” says Dirk Standaert, CEO of Peace of Meat...

The current bioreactor allows the company to work on such volumes:
“But our target obviously, is to upscale further. The new facility
will be used for R&D purposes and we will be able to house a lot more
people,” he explains, as his team has grown exponentially in just one
year...

In total, with just its first plant, MeaTech could produce around 20
tons of biomass per year, to be added as an ingredient to hybrid meat
alternatives... MeaTech plans to establish between four to five
factories worldwide by 2025, which could produce around 560 tons of
biomass per year. Adding just one single ingredient able to give
meatier and juicy features would be an asset for companies that wish
to find solutions to enhance the taste and mouthfeel of their
products, while lowering costs and ingredients lists.

The company is further extending their collaboration with the Dutch
based mycoprotein start up ENOUGH, which will combine the chicken
biomass within their plant based matrix...
