# The End of the World is Just the Beginning

Peter Zeihan

Between 1500 and 1778, France suffered several national famines (and
dozens of regional famines). Yes, that France—the country that has
been Europe’s largest and most reliable food producer stretching back
a millennium, the country that has three SEPARATE agricultural
regions, the country that had, bar none, the best internal transport
system of the preindustrial world.

Moving things overland *sucks*.

So we figured out how to move stuff a different way. We figured out how
to float.

While a camel could move a quarter ton and ox-drawn carts around a
ton, even the earliest bulk ships could move several hundred tons at a
fraction of the price per ton. The Romans famously imported most of
their capital’s food from Egypt. Remember those
better-than-world-class Roman roads? In 300 CE it cost more to move
grain 70 miles on those roads than it did to sail it some 1,400 miles
from Egypt to Rome. The economics of water transport were so lopsided
that some cultures (see: government; Dutch, Aztec, Chinese) would
rearrange their entire governing systems around the capacity to
mobilize labor to dig canals stretching hundreds of miles through
rocky, undulating landscapes with little more than stone picks. All to
float what was the pinnacle of human transport technology well into
the second millennium CE: the lowly barge.
