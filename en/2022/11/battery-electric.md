# Battery Electric Vehicles, Storage, Electrification

The first rule for determining suitable tech is a tech's ability of to
provide the most with the least. A basic, abundant material that
allows storage, transport and fuel applications at the same time will
be preferable than a rare-earth one that creates heavy, toxic,
single-use technology.  The latter tech, lithium ion batteries will
not suitable for wide adoption. Candidate tech should be allow
low-end, and high-end applications that will translate to lower TOC,
lower costs for training, maintanance.

### The Battery

Weight

Lithium-ion batteries' energy density ranges between 260-270 Wh/kg,
a high number which makes them unsuitable for high-end applications.
