# Dried Poultry + Veg

Ingredients

* 1 kg Turkey (or Chicken) Meat
* 1/2 Bunch Swiss chards 
* 2 Oranges
* 1 Diced Onion
* 1 Teaspoon Turmeric
* 1 Teaspoon Pepper Flakes
* 1 kg yogurt

Cut meat into chunks and place on aliminum foil sheet. Add the
turmeric, diced onions, peppers on top, wrap the foil around close off
all sides. Place pocket in oven at 200 C for 1/2 hours or until meat
is well cooked.

Once done open foil, drain away any fat, water, onions, only keep the
meat. Put in bowl, add chards. Cut orange into 8 pieces each, add the
flesh in the bowl as well. Now blend.

Put the mix in spoon-sized pieces on a drier at 55 degrees C and dry
for 7-8 hours.

Seperately, dry yogurt in the oven at 100 C or so until it loses all
water.

Now put dried meat + chard + orange mix in a dry bowl, add the dried
yogurt, mix it well. 

That's it. 

Note: Adding veg and fruit as raw eases the blending process, through
their water which will be dried anyway. Once the veg+fruit are mixed
well with the meat, drying expands the whole mix into into a small
chewable pieces.

Note: If swiss chards are not available, similar green veg low in iron
can be used (ie not spinach, or purslane).
