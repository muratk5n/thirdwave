# Dried Poultry + Veg

Ingredients

* 1 kg Turkey (or Chicken) Meat
* 2 Cups Shredded Swiss chards, or Cabbage
* 2 Oranges
* 1 Diced Onion
* 1 Teaspoon Turmeric
* 1 Teaspoon Pepper Flakes
* 1/2 kg high-fat dry cheese

Cut meat into chunks and place in dish add the turmeric, diced onions,
peppers on top. Place in oven at 200 C for 1/2 hours or until meat is
well cooked. Once done throw away any fat, water, onions. Put turkey
meat in bowl, add chards, orange flesh. Now blend (hand-held blender
works well). Put the mix in spoon-sized lumps on a drier at 55 degrees
C and dry for 7-8 hours.

Now put meat mix in a dry bowl, add cheese, mix.

That's it. 

Note: Adding veg and fruit as raw eases the blending process, through
their water which will be dried anyway. Once the veg+fruit are mixed
well with the meat, drying expands the whole mix into into a small
chewable pieces.

Note: Instead of yogurt, tallow is fine, melt, pour on dried meat,
mix. Or high-fat dry cheese eg brynza, mix as-is since such cheeses
are already pretty dry.
