# Dried Poultry Meat with Fruit and Veg

Ingredients

* 3/4 kg Turkey (or Chicken) Meat
* 1/2 Bunch Swiss chards 
* 2 Orange
* 1 Diced Onion
* 1 Teaspoon Turmeric
* 1 Teaspoon Pepper Flakes
* 1 kg yogurt

Cut meat into chunks and place on aliminum foil sheet. Add the
turmeric, diced onions, peppers on top, wrap the foil around close off
from all sides. Place pocket in oven at 200 C for 1/2 hours or until
meat is well cooked.

Once done open foil, drain away any fat, water, onions, only keep the
meat. In a bowl add chards. Cut orange into 8 pieces each, add the
flesh in the bowl as well. Now blend. Place the mix in spoon-sized
pieces on a drier at 55 degrees C and dry for 7-8 hours.

Seperately, dry yogurt in the oven at 100 C or so until it loses all
water.

Now put dried meat + chard + orange mix in a dry bowl, add the dried
yogurt, mix it well. 

That's it. This is durable portable food with all necessary ingredients.
50C drying will make sure all vitamin did not evaporate, but everything
still became dry. Yogurt provides animal fat, calcium. The poultry
obivouly gives protein and B-complex nutrients. 

Note: It is critical veg and fruit are added raw into the blending,
because they ease the blending process through their water (cooked
poultry is still to pretty tough shred) and once the veg+fruit are
enmeshed with the poultry, drying expands the whole mix into into a
small chewable pieces.

Replacements

Swiss chards are used as they are low in iron, and nutritious. If not
available, similar green leaf veg can be used, that isn't too high in
iron (ie not spinach, or purslane).
