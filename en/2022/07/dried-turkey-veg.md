# Dried Poultry Meat with Fruit and Veg

Ingredients (for three patties)

* 3/4 kg Turkey (or Chicken) Meat
* 1/2 Bunch Swiss chards 
* 2 Orange
* 1 Diced Onion
* 1 Teaspoon Turmeric
* 1 Teaspoon Pepper Flakes
* 1 kg yogurt

Cut meat into chunks and place them in aliminum foil. Add the turmeric,
diced onions, peppers on it, wrap the foil around close off all sides.
Place in oven at 200 C 1/2 or until meat is well cooked.

Once done open foil, drain away the fat, water, onions, only keep the
meat. In a bowl add meat, chards. Cut orange into 8 pieces each, add
the flesh in the bowl. Blend. Place on a drier at 55 degrees C and dry
for 7-8 hours.

Seperately dry yogurt in the oven at 100 C or so until it loses all water.

Put dried meat + chard + orange mix in a dry bowl, and mix in the
dried (but fatty) yogurt. Can do this part by hand as long as hands
washed previously and dried (the whole point of drying it to get rid
of pesky bacteria, no point of adding them back in!).

That's it. This is durable portable food with all necessary ingredients.
50C drying will make sure all vitamin did not evaporate, but everything
still became dry.
