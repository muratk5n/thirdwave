# Dried Poultry + Veg

Ingredients

* 1 kg Turkey (or Chicken) Meat
* 2 Cups Shredded Swiss chards
* 2 Oranges
* 1 Teaspoon Turmeric
* 1 Teaspoon Pepper Flakes
* 1/2 kg high-fat dry cheese (brynza)

Cut meat into chunks and place in dish add the turmeric,
peppers. Place in oven at 200 C for 1/2 hours or until meat is well
done. Once done throw away any fat, water. Put it in bowl, add chards,
orange flesh. Now blend (hand-held blender works well). Put the mix in
drier at 55 degrees C and dry for 7-8 hours.

Once done add high-fat cheese, mix.

Notes:

- Adding veg and fruit as raw eases the blending process, through their water.
- Instead of cheese, tallow is fine; melt, pour on dried meat, mix. 
- For flavor, instant soups in powder form can be added after drying. Some
  products even have broth in them, also can contain fats, and milk or
  yogurt in dried form (such as the Greek *trahana*). If their fat
  amount is enough, the cheese listed above could perhaps be omitted.
