apple, beetroot, blend (hand-held blender works well, note adding
veg/fruit raw eases the blending process, through their water). Put
the mix into the drier at 55 degrees C and dry for 10 hours until
whole thing becomes dry kibbles.

Once done seperately mix olive oil and tallow, place in oven 5 mins,
melt, now pour the mix on on dried poultry [2].
