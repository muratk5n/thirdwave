<h1>H2 Production via Biology</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/hydrogen-production-microbial-biomass-conversion">DOE</a></p>
<p>In fermentation-based systems, microorganisms, such as bacteria, break
down organic matter to produce hydrogen. The organic matter can be
refined sugars, raw biomass sources such as corn stover, and even
wastewater. Because no light is required, these methods are sometimes
called "dark fermentation" methods...</p>
<p>Why Is This Pathway Being Considered? Biomass is an abundant domestic
resource, and many microbes have evolved to efficiently break down
biomass to produce hydrogen and other products. Fermentation has
already been used as an industrial technology to generate biofuels and
other products, and many of the challenges to scaling up systems have
been addressed for different products, allowing hydrogen researchers
to focus on the challenges unique to hydrogen production. MEC-based
systems have the potential to produce hydrogen from resources that
otherwise can’t be used for fuel production, and could reduce the
large amount of energy normally needed for wastewater treatment while
producing a valuable fuel in the form of hydrogen. These two pathways
can be combined to maximize the hydrogen yield from the starting
biomass feedstock.</p>

<p>Designer bacteria could fuel the future with cheap
hydrogen.. Macquarie synthetic biologists have made a breakthrough in
renewable energy production by creating genetically-engineered
sugar-loving bacteria that can produce on-demand, zero-emission
hydrogen fuel..</p>
<p>The genetic engineering of the microbes is partly funded by a $1.1
million grant from the Australian Government’s Renewable Energy Agency
(ARENA) and supported by industry partners BOC Australia and
Bioplatforms Australia.</p>
<p>'This is renewable energy that uses a two-part system; first, the
bacteria consume the sugar and as it digests the sugar it produces the
hydrogen gas,' [researcher] explains...</p>
<p>Farming bacteria to produce hydrogen also has economic and
environmental advantages – in the right setting, bacteria rapidly
multiply, they are cheap to create and don’t need much space...</p>
<p>The University team has used genetic engineering approaches to change
the DNA of certain strains of E. coli bacteria to produce hydrogen
from sugars.</p>
<p>By accelerating the metabolism of the bacteria and finding the optimum
conditions for production, they have produced a strain that makes
hydrogen at rates higher than any previous published rates of
bacterial bio-hydrogen.</p>

<p>There is an evergrowing demand for environment-friendly processes to
synthesize ammonia (NH3) from atmospheric nitrogen (N2). Although
diazotrophic N2 fixation represents an undeniably “green” process of
NH3 synthesis, the slow reaction rate makes it less suitable for
industrially meaningful large-scale production. Here, we report the
photoinduced N2 fixation using a hybrid system composed of colloidal
quantum dots (QDs) and aerobic N2-fixing bacteria, <em>Azotobacter
vinelandii</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.anthropocenemagazine.org/2022/02/ammonia-secreting-bacteria-bring-us-closer-to-a-world-free-of-industrial-fertilizers%EF%BF%BC/">Link</a></p>
<p>Researchers have engineered a common soil bacteria to steadily secrete
ammonia... One day, these novel engineered microbes could replace the
chemical fertilizers that are ubiquitous on farmland.. the researchers
introduce their star candidate: a bacteria called Azotobacter
vinelandii which is part of the diazotroph family. Diazotrophs are
biologically equipped to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, turning it
into the compound known as ammonia, which it leaches out in varied and
typically low concentrations.</p>
<p>Because ammonia is so fundamental to the growth of plants,
A. vinelandii has long been of interest to researchers, who had also
identified a particular gene in this bacteria that seems to be
involved in regulating its natural ammonia production. But, until now
no one has understood exactly how this gene drives the
ammonia-excreting behavior—which would be the key to controlling it,
and perhaps boosting ammonia production to make it functionally useful
for crops.</p>
<p>The researchers set out to discover this by experimentally tweaking
the gene to see how that impacted its functioning. Through this they
discovered they could influence the bacteria to start producing
ammonia—and critically, they could dial up its production to create
larger quantities than before..</p>

<p>Biohydrogen is H2 that is produced biologically..The biological
hydrogen production with algae is a method of photobiological water
splitting which is done in a closed photobioreactor based on the
production of hydrogen as a solar fuel by algae. Algae produce
hydrogen under certain conditions. In 2000 it was discovered that if
C. reinhardtii algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the
production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production
of hydrogen.</p>
