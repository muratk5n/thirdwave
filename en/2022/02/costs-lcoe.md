# Energy Production Costs, LCOH, LCOE

Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)

[DOE](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/08/f25/LCOE.pdf)

LCOE measures lifetime costs divided by energy production. Calculates
present value of the total cost of building and operating a power
plant over an assumed lifetime. Allows the comparison of different
technologies (e.g., wind, solar, natural gas) of unequal life spans,
project size, different capital cost, risk, return, and capacities.

Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH)

Similar to LCOE but for pure hydrogen generation. Since there are
other routes to H2 generation other than electrolysis (therefore using
electricity) such direct demonstration of a cost can be beneficial.

Simple LCOE Concept

Calculating and comparing LCOE can: Measure value across the longer
term, showing projected life-cycle costs.. Highlight opportunities for
Tribes to develop different scales of projects (facility, community,
or commercial).. Inform decisions to pursue projects on an economic
basis, compared to utility rates

Overnight cost

The overnight cost is a part of the capital cost. It includes
construction, system cost, procurement cost, engineering cost, cost of
equipment, frst fuel load, and other costs (

Some Data Points

* Avi Shultz (DOE) on CSP: "Our benchmark is based on a plant of
approximately 100 MW with 14 hours of thermal energy storage. We model
that plant would have an LCOE of 9.5 cents/kWh (with no incentives) if
built in the US today"

* Conversion Factors, H2 143 MJ/kg, 0.143 GJ/kg
