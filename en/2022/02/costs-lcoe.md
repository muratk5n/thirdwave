# Energy Production Costs, LCOE

Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) - DOE, [PDF](https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/08/f25/LCOE.pdf)

LCOE measures lifetime costs divided by energy production

* Calculates present value of the total cost of building and operating
a power plant over an assumed lifetime.

* Allows the comparison of different technologies (e.g., wind, solar,
natural gas) of unequal life spans, project size, different capital
cost, risk, return, and capacities.

Simple LCOE Concept

Calculating and comparing LCOE can:

* Measure value across the longer term, showing projected life-cycle
costs

* Highlight opportunities for Tribes to develop different scales of
projects (facility, community, or commercial)

* Inform decisions to pursue projects on an economic
basis, compared to utility rates

Info Points on various energy source costs

Avi Shultz (DOE) on CSP: "Our benchmark is based on a plant of
approximately 100 MW with 14 hours of thermal energy storage. We model
that plant would have an LCOE of 9.5 cents/kWh (with no incentives) if
built in the US today"
