# Ammonia

How do we transport hydrogen? Usually pressurized tanks are used as a
solution. For a cheaper alternative researchers are looking at
"hydrogen carriers", substances which contain H2, but can be carried
efficiently.

Among these products ammonia stands out. Ammonia is advantageous in
transportation and storage because it has large hydrogen content per
unit volume, and is easily liquefiable (8.46 atm at 20°C). So existing
liquid transportation methods can carry it. The formula is for ammonia
NH3, hydrogen H2. Two H's as we see are in NH3.

There is already a huge infrastructure for producing ammonia. It is
produced about 150 million tons per year. Ammonia is used in cleaning
products, known for its sharp smell and ability to clean any kind of
grease. In movies, if dude passed out, someone brings a cloth to his
nose, he smell it, and wakes right the f--k up. That's ammonia.

Clean production methods: Folks at George Washington University came
up with an approach that uses air and water as a source of H2 . Air is
made up of 78% N2 . In their process the bubble of wet air is passed
through a mixture of tiny particles of iron oxide and molten NaOH and
KOH. When electricity is applied H2 is extracted from water and allows
H2O and air to interact directly to form NH3.

How to use ammonia as fuel: either convert it to hydrogen as needed
and use H2 fuel cells for power. Some are also looking at ammonia fuel
cells to use NH3 directly in the FC. No carbon emissions in either
case.

[Danish company] Haldor Topsoe has greatly improved the near-term
prospects for green ammonia by announcing a demonstration of its
next-generation ammonia synthesis plant. This new technology uses a
solid oxide electrolysis cell to make synthesis gas (hydrogen and
nitrogen), which feeds Haldor Topsoe’s existing technology: the
Haber-Bosch plant. The product is ammonia, made from air, water, and
renewable electricity ...

“We expect that ammonia can be used for transportation and efficient
storage of energy. The greatest advantage of ammonia is that it has a
high energy density which makes it an effective fuel and energy
storage option – and it can thereby solve some of the most important
challenges of creating a sustainable energy system of the future,”
says project leader, Senior Principal Scientist John Bøgild Hansen. ...

In conventional plants today, ammonia is made by combining hydrogen,
produced from coal or natural gas or another polluting fuel, with
nitrogen, produced by an air separation unit (ASU). Polluting
hydrocarbons aren’t the only viable source of hydrogen but, in most
places, they are the cheapest. I’ve previously written about how
today’s natural gas-fed Haber-Bosch plant is almost perfectly energy
efficient, due to decades of incremental innovation co-optimizing the
steam methane reformation (SMR) units, which produce hydrogen from
natural gas, and the HB units.

Since the start of the 20th Century, however, ammonia plants around
the world have used electrolyzers to produce hydrogen from water,
making industrial quantities of carbon-free “green” ammonia. Due to
economics, only a couple of these plants still operate today. This
technology always uses alkaline electrolysis cells (AEC) to produce
the hydrogen that is fed to the HB unit. AEC is a mature technology
but, unlike SMR, it did not evolve alongside HB; it has not been
integrated and co-optimized over decades into the design and
engineering of an ammonia plant. ...
