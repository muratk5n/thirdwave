# Methyl Cyclohexane for H2 Storage

[The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/08/the-perfect-storm-woodside-energy-and-siemens-invest-in-australias-hydrogen-economy?CMP=share_btn_tw)

In March, the Queensland University of Technology [QUT] made history
when it achieved the first export of a small quantity of clean, green
hydrogen produced in Australia from renewable energy, to Japanese
energy giant JXTG – proving that it was in fact possible.

The actors involved; JXTG, is Japan’s largest petroleum
conglomerate. QUT provided solar panels that can work with salt
water. The second link above also says:

"[H2] was created by adding water and acid to a chemical called
toluene in an electrochemical process using solar energy. The toluene
was converted into a substance called methyl cyclohexane (MCH) using
JXTG’s process powered by QUT’s solar arrays".

Methyl cyclohexane is a convenient carrier for H2, as liquid and at
normal temparatures.

"Methyl cyclohexane is a clear colorless liquid with a petroleum-like
odor. Flash point 25°F. Less dense than water and insoluble in
water. Vapors heavier than air".

On the receiving end,

"Once shipped to Japan, the MCH was converted back to toluene and
the hydrogen extracted for use in a suitable fuel cell or vehicle. The
toluene is then available for re-use in the transportation cycle."

Australia has the sunshine, ports, expertise and logistics in
transportation. The process described above uses a proprietry tech
developed by JXTG. If I was a country with lots of sunshine, I'd
invite them to set up shop in my country, let them produce, export H2
(to themselves in Japan) from sunshine, tax their ass, and use the
money for whatever. U'd literally be making money out of thin air.
