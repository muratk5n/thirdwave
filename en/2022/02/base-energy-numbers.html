<p>1 barrel of crude oil carries approximately 1700 kwh of energy.</p>
<p>As standard the 1 barrel (119 liter) of crude oil produce approximately
159 liters of gasoline / petrol.</p>
<p>8 kWh of heat can be generated from 1 kg of coal</p>
<p>H2 pipelines can carry 7 GW for 36 inch and 13 GW for 48-inch pipelines.</p>
<p><a name='lithium'></a></p>
<p>Lithium</p>
<p>There is &gt;60kg of lithium carbonate in a 70kWh battery. 400 liters of
water is used per kilo of lithium [7]. Water is a problem bcz while
lithium rich water is pumped, potable water resources also shift.</p>
<p>The entire world reserve for lithium is estimated to be ~17 million
tonnes.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_energy_consumption">EIA</a>,
estimated world energy consumption was 157,481 Terrawatt Hours in 2013, 
meaning 431 TWh/day. If we were to store today's energy consumption one
day in batteries,</p>
<pre><code class="python">consumed_one_day = 431 * 1e9 # Kwh
reserves = 17.0 # mtones
req = ((consumed_one_day / 70.0) * 60.0) / 1e9
print (&quot;%d mil. tons&quot; % req)
print (&quot;Can hold %0.2f percent of required energy&quot; % ((reserves / req)*100.0) )
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">369 mil. tons
Can hold 4.60 percent of required energy

<p>.. it would require over 20 times the amount of available lithium in
the world.</p>
<p>Grid and Pipelines</p>
<p>Pipelines can transmit 10 times the energy at one-eighth the costs
associated with electricity transmission lines [8]. </p>
<p>Gasoline</p>
<p>1 gallon is 2.56 kg. In Europe the gasoline price is about 9 dollar
per gallon, or 3.51 dollar / kg.</p>
<p>H2</p>
<p>Green ammonia production efficiency is over 74% [12]. "Crackers" that
generate H2 from ammonia are about 76% efficient [6].</p>
<p>Personal Consumption</p>
<p>10 KW / person, based on first world standards.</p>
<p>Typical energy requirements of household items</p>
<p>Single burner electric stove: 1500 Watts
TV: 80-400 Watts
Fridge: 100-250 watts</p>
<p>Electric heating / stove is 33% efficient [10]</p>
<p>HFC Cars</p>
<p>A Nexo tank carries 210 kWh of energy. The car can travel 756 km on a
full tank [3], the tank capacity is 6.33 kg. There are actually three
tanks, each at 10,000 psi [4].</p>
<p>For the Toyota Mirai, the energy capacity of the fuel-cell vehicle's 5
kilograms of hydrogen, compressed at 10,000 psi, is more than 150
kilowatt-hours [5]. Max range 500 km, 1848 weight, </p>

w = (F*500*1000) / 3600.

<p>Solar panels</p>
<p>Sun energy falling on Earth on average (accounting for day/night seasons)
at its highest point </p>
<p>300 W/m2</p>
<p>Solar panel efficiency is 20%</p>
<p>Electrolysis</p>
<p>Current best processes for water electrolysis (PEM or alkaline
electrolysis) have an effective electrical efficiency of 70–80%,
producing 1 kg of hydrogen requires 50–55 kW⋅h of electricity
[1]. </p>
<p>Storage in Pipelines</p>
<p>H2 pipelines can transmit energy efficiencly. But even when we are not
pumping in new H2, the pipes themselves would still have gas in them,
so they can be considered a form of storage. The capacity of the
German natural gas network is more than 200,000 GWh, which meets the
requirements for several months. In comparison, the capacity of all
the German pumped storage power plants only amounts to about 40 GWh [13].</p>
<p>Desalination</p>
<p>Energy consumption [2] of seawater desalination has reached as low as 4 kWh/$m^3$,</p>

<p>How much solar panel space would Saudi Arabia need to produce its
crude output's equiv energy,</p>
<p>Production is 9.01 million barrels / day (Nov 2020).</p>
<p>1 Barrel of oil is 136 kg. 1 barrel is 0.16 m3. Energy density of
crude oil 10.2 Kwh/kg. 1 million barrels of oil can produce half a
million barrels of gasoline. Gasoline energy density is 12.88 kwh/kg.</p>
