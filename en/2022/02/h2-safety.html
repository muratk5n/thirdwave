<h1>H2 Safety, Reduced/Zero Emissions</h1>
<h3>Safety</h3>
<p><a href="https://hydrogen-central.com/why-hydrogen-safer-you-might-think-bayotech/">H2 Central</a></p>
<p>Hydrogen is the lightest of all elements – it’s fourteen times lighter
than air and rises quickly in the event of a leak, dispersing
harmlessly into the atmosphere. Unlike gasoline, hydrogen will not
pool on the ground, potentially contaminating water sources and soil,
or creating a catastrophe if ignited.</p>
<p>Polluting fuels pose significant health and environmental safety threats
when leaked, spilled, or combusted. Hydrogen leaks are non-toxic, this
is in steep contrast to other fuels. If diesel gets into the
waterways, it can cause serious pollution to rivers, streams and
groundwater.</p>
<p>Hydrogen is less combustible. Gasoline in the air is flammable at a
lower concentration limit of 1.4%, compared to hydrogen’s 4%. To put
it another way, gasoline is two to three times more flammable in the
air. The optimal mixture for hydrogen combustion is 29%—which in
reality is quite unusual, since hydrogen rises and will generally
diffuse. Gasoline vapor’s optimal mixture for combustion is only 2%—a
ratio that is very easy to reach.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event of ignition, hydrogen burns faster than
gasoline and with a lower radiant heat due to the absence of
carbon. Therefore, the risk of secondary fires due to hydrogen is also
lower. BTW: Modern pressurized hydrogen storage tanks are designed to
make it impossible for sources of ignition (oxidizers) to come into
contact with the fuel...</p>
<p>Robust Safety Measures</p>
<p>Hydrogen has been safely used in a variety of applications for over
half a century—giving time for scientists and engineers to develop and
implement rigorous safety protocols.  </p>
<p>The Department of Energy and other global entities have created safety
codes and standards based on decades of research and testing by
private sector companies. These standards have helped build processes
that mitigate potential harms.</p>

<p>Citing a 2003 white paper, “Twenty Hydrogen Myths,” by American
physicist and Chairman/Chief Scientist of the Rocky Mountain Institute
Amory B. Lovins, Hydrogen Fuel News notes hydrogen burns quickly with
a nonluminous flame that “cannot readily scorch a person at a distance
as it emits only one-tenth the radiant heat of a hydrocarbon fire and
burns 7% cooler than gasoline.”</p>
<p>“In fact, to speak further to hydrogen safety compared to gasoline
safety, typically, victims of hydrogen fires are not typically burned
unless they are actually in contact with the flame,” the trade
publication wrote. “Furthermore, they’re also not choked by smoke.”</p>
<h3>Emissions</h3>
<p>Fuel-Cells</p>
<p>As there is no carbon in H2 molecule, it's use in fuel-cells will only
result in water as output. It is the cleanest fuel known to mankind.</p>
<p>Atmosphere</p>
<p>H2 is a light molecule if it in the atmosphere it will leak into space
[2]. Some observed [1] that hydrogen in the atmosphere can destroy a
molecule known as the hydroxyl radical that otherwise destroys
methane—a gas that contributes to greenhouse warming, but the real
problem here is methane itself, whose emission would be cut anyway due
to a clean alternative being available now, the alternative being
hydrogen.</p>
<p><a name='nox'></a></p>
<p>Combustion Engines</p>
<p>For the combustion scenario additional care must be taken to avoid NOx
emissions. The H2 car engine design described here [3] that enabled
the exhaust gas to be re-introduced / recirculated that results in NOx
emissions of 1 ppm (regular car NOx emissions is &gt; 300 ppm).</p>
<p>There are other techniques; a stratification technique used in new
diesel / hydrogen hybrid engines has varied concentration of hydrogen
gas within different sections of the combustion chamber, these
variations can affect the chemical reactions and control the amount of
NOx produced by the engine, then the timing of the hydrogen injection
is used to limit NOx production. 'We have shown in our system that if
you make it stratified—that is, in some areas there is more hydrogen
and in others there is less hydrogen—then we can reduce the NOx
emissions below that of a pure diesel engine,' said the UNSW
researcher [4].</p>
