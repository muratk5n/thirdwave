# H2 From Methane (Natural Gas)

[Article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196890422000413)

We investigated the costs and GHG emissions of three blue hydrogen
production technologies. Blue hydrogen cost ranges from $1.69-$2.55
per kg H2 depending on the production technology.

Autothermal reforming (ATR) with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and
natural gas decomposition with CCS produce H2 has the lowest and
highest cost, respectively. Blue hydrogen from ATR process has the
lowest GHG emissions, 3.91 kg CO2 eq/kg H2. The economics of a steam
reforming plant depends on the CO2 capture rate.

Interest in blue hydrogen production technologies is growing. Some
researchers have evaluated the environmental and/or economic
feasibility of producing blue hydrogen, but a holistic assessment is
still needed. Many aspects of hydrogen production have not been
investigated. There is very limited information in the literature on
the impact of plant size on production and the extent of carbon
capture on the cost and life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of
blue hydrogen production through various production pathways. Detailed
uncertainty and sensitivity analyses have not been included in most of
the earlier studies.

This study conducts a holistic comparative cost and life cycle GHG
emissions’ footprint assessment of three natural gas-based blue
hydrogen production technologies – steam methane reforming (SMR),
autothermal reforming (ATR), and natural gas decomposition (NGD) to
address these research gaps.
