# H2 FAQ

<a name="viafossil"></a>

Q: Some claim hydrogen is clean but most hydrogen today is created via
fossil fuels.

A: If H2 is used in cars, heating, energy storage and transport, those
domains become clean. There will not be emissions from cars, heaters,
air travel, and there is no danger of leakage, pollution during
transport (a big problem for oil and gas). Then, once the source of
hydrogen becomes clean, every point in the chain now becomes clean.

Different parts of H2 transition can take place in parallel. While we
clean up transport, distribution, we can aim to make production clean.
Since transport, and storage are needed anyway, it makes sense to
start work on that infrastructure now, whether or not the source of hydrogen
is 100% clean.
