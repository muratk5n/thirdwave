# H2 End Use Domains

Along with the ease of storage, transport, and generation, clean fuels
enjoy, they are also attractive due to the fact they can be applied
anywhere, e.g. in combustion engines for motor vehicles, creating
power in turbines or fuel-cells, heating, or making steel. 

### Steel Production

For some domains like steel production there is already no other way
other than hydrogen to make the process carbon free. In traditional
steel making, reduction of iron ore is done by heating it together
with coal, utilizing a chemical reaction that separates the oxygen
from the iron, forming and emitting CO2. In H2 based production,
hydrogen reacts with iron ore similarly to carbon, resulting in the
extraction of oxygen. But instead of creating CO2, the main by-product
is H2O [1].

"Industry sectors like steelmaking traditionally rely on fossil fuels
to produce the intense heat and feed the chemical process needed to
smelt iron ore. But switching from coking coal to a cleaner feedstock
like hydrogen offers a solution that produces only harmless steam
emissions" 

### Heating

Wherever natural gas is fed into homes and buildings for heating
purposes, H2 can replace it, even through dual-use boilers. The boiler
sold by Worcester Bosch is such a solution [2]
