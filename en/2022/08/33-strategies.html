<h1>33 Strategies of War</h1>

<p>Soviets in Afghanistan</p>
<p>A key country in the Russians' plans for expansion was Afghanistan, on
their southern border.  Afghanistan was rich in natural gas and other
minerals and had ports on the Indian Ocean; to make it a Soviet
satellite would be a dream come true...</p>
<p>The invasion itself went more easily than the Soviets had expected,
and for this military phase their leaders could confidently declare
"mission accomplished." But within weeks of Andropov's visit, they had
to adjust this assessment: the mujahideen were not intimidated by the
Soviet army..</p>
<p>To let the rebels alone was to give the mujahideen the time and space
to grow more dangerous, yet the army was too small to occupy whole
regions. Its answer was to repeat its police operations again and
again, but with more violence, hoping to intimidate the Afghans--but,
as Orgakov had predicted, this only emboldened them...</p>
<p>Years passed, and morale in the Soviet army dropped precipitously: the
soldiers felt the hatred of the local population and were stuck
guarding static positions, never knowing when the next ambush would
come. Abuse of drugs and alcohol became widespread... But the Soviet
leaders could not afford to pull out: besides creating a dangerous
power vacuum in Afghanistan, that would deliver a sharp blow to their
global reputation as a superpower.  And so they stayed, each year
supposedly the last.  The senior members of the Politburo slowly died
off-- Brezhnev in 1982, Andropov and Ustinov in 1984-- without seeing
the slightest progress.</p>
<p>In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary of the Soviet
Union. Having opposed the war from the beginning, Gorbachev started
phased withdrawals of troops from Afghanistan. The last soldiers left
early in 1989. In all, over 14,000 Soviet soldiers died in the
conflict, but the hidden costs--to the delicate Russian economy, to
the people's slender faith in their government--were far greater.
Only a few years later, the entire system would come tumbling down.</p>
<p><a name='mohammad'></a></p>
<p>Mohammad</p>
<p>Muslims then marched through the mountain valleys upon Mecca. Muhammad
divided his force into four columns....  Muhammad gave strict orders
that no violence was to be used. His own tent was pitched on high
ground immediately overlooking the town. Eight years before, he had
fled from Mecca under cover of darkness, and lain hidden three days in
a cave on Mount Thor, which from his tent he could now see rising
beyond the city. Now ten thousand warriors were ready to obey his
least command and his native town lay helpless at his feet.  After a
brief rest, he [..] entered the town [..]. Muhammad [..] was not
vindictive. A general amnesty was proclaimed, from which less than a
dozen persons were excluded, only four being actually
executed. Ikrima, the son of Abu Jahal, escaped to the Yemen, but his
wife appealed to the Apostle, who agreed to forgive him.... The Muslim
occupation of Mecca was thus virtually bloodless. The fiery Khalid ibn
al Waleed killed a few people at the southern gate and was sharply
reprimanded by Muhammad for doing so. Although the Apostle had himself
been persecuted in the city and although many of his bitterest
opponents were still living there, he won all hearts by his clemency
on his day of triumph. Such generosity [..] was particularly
remarkable among Arabs, a race to whom revenge has always been dear.</p>

<p>Galipoli</p>
<p>"World War I began in August 1914, and by the end of that year, all
along the Western Front, the British and French were caught in a
deadly stalemate with the Germans. Meanwhile, though, on the Eastern
Front, Germany was badly beating the Russians, allies of Britain and
France. Britain's military leaders had to try a new strategy, and
their plan, backed by [..]  Churchill and others, was to stage an
attack on Gallipoli, a peninsula on Turkey's Dardanelles
Strait. Turkey was an ally of Germany's, and the Dardanelles was the
gateway to [Istanbul..]. If the Allies could take Gallipoli,
[Istanbul] would follow, and Turkey would have to leave the war. In
addition, using bases in Turkey and the Balkans, the Allies could
attack Germany from the southeast, dividing its armies and weakening
its ability to fight on the Western Front. They would also have a
clear supply line to Russia. Victory at Gallipoli would change the
course of the war. The plan was approved, and in March 1915, General
Sir Ian Hamilton was named to lead the campaign. Hamilton, at
sixty-two, was an able strategist and an experienced commander. He and
Churchill felt certain that their forces, including Australians and
New Zealanders, would out-match the Turks. Churchill's orders were
simple: take Constantinople. He left the details to the general.</p>
<p>Hamilton's plan was to land at three points on the southwestern tip of
the Gallipoli peninsula, secure the beaches, and sweep north. The
landings took place on April 27. From the beginning almost everything
went wrong: the army's maps were inaccurate, its troops landed in the
wrong places, the beaches were much narrower than expected. Worst of
all, the Turks fought back [..] well. At the end of the first day,
most of the Allies' 70,000 men had landed, but they were unable to
advance beyond the beaches, where the Turks would hold them pinned
down for several weeks. It was another stalemate; Gallipoli had become
a disaster.</p>
<p>All seemed lost, but in June, Churchill convinced the government to
send more troops and Hamilton devised a new plan. He would land 20,000
men at Suvla Bay, some twenty miles to the north. Suvla was a
vulnerable target: it had a large harbor, the terrain was low-lying
and easy, and it was defended by only a handful of Turks. An invasion
here would force the Turks to divide their forces, freeing up the
Allied armies to the south. The stalemate would be broken, and
Gallipoli would fall [..].</p>
<p>Hamilton's style was to tell his officers the purpose of an upcoming
battle but leave it to them how to bring it about. He was a gentleman,
never blunt or forceful [..] Hamilton did have one request. Once the
Turks knew of the landings at Suvla, they would rush in
reinforcements. As soon as the Allies were ashore, then, Hamilton
wanted them to advance immediately to a range of hills four miles
inland, called Tekke Tepe, and to get there before the Turks. From
Tekke Tepe the Allies would dominate the peninsula. The order was
simple enough, but Hamilton, so as not to offend his subordinate,
expressed it in the most general terms. Most crucially, he specified
no time frame. He was sufficiently vague that Stopford completely
misinterpreted him: instead of trying to reach Tekke Tepe "as soon as
possible," Stopford thought he should advance to the hills "if
possible." That was the order he gave Hammersley. And as Hammersley,
nervous about the whole campaign, passed it down to his colonels, the
order became less urgent and vaguer still [..].</p>
<p>The attack began in the early morning of August 7. The next morning
Hamilton began to sense that something had gone very wrong. From
reconnaissance aircraft he knew that the flat land around Suvla was
essentially empty and undefended; the way to Tekke Tepe was open--the
troops had only to march--but they were staying where they
were. [..Hamilton decides to visit the front himself] He finally
located Hammersley--he was at the far end of the bay, busily
supervising the building of his temporary headquarters. Asked why he
had failed to secure the hills, Hammersley replied that he had sent
several brigades for the purpose, but they had encountered Turkish
artillery and his colonels had told him they could not advance without
more instructions [..] Although it was already night, Hamilton ordered
Hammersley to send a brigade immediately to Tekke Tepe. It would be a
race to the finish.</p>
<p>Hamilton returned to a boat in the harbor to monitor the situation. At
sunrise the next morning, he watched the battlefield through
binoculars--and saw, to his horror, the Allied troops in headlong
retreat to Suvla. A large [Otto] force had arrived at Tekke Tepe
thirty minutes before them. In the next few days, the Turks managed to
regain the flats around Suvla and to pin Hamilton's army on the
beach. Some four months later, the Allies gave up their attack on
Gallipoli and evacuated their troops.</p>
