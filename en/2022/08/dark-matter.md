# Dark Matter

[Pavel Kroupa](https://iai.tv/articles/dark-matter-doesnt-exist-auid-2180?_auid=2020)

The current cosmological model only works by postulating the existence
of dark matter – a substance that has never been detected, but that is
supposed to constitute approximately 25% of all the universe. But a
simple test suggests that dark matter does not in fact exist. If it
did, we would expect lighter galaxies orbiting heavier ones to be
slowed down by dark matter particles, but we detect no such
slow-down. A host of other observational tests support the conclusion:
dark matter is not there. The implications of this are nothing short
of a revision of Einstein’s theory of gravitation. Why the scientific
community is in denial about the falsification of the dark matter
model is a question that requires both a sociological and
philosophical explanation, argues Pavel Kroupa.

The List of Flawed Falsification Claims about MOND [modified theory of
Newton that can account data without dark matter hypothesis].. Modern
theories in physics need to be tested and, if they significantly fail
a test, discarded...

In this sense, the dark-matter based theories (case A above) have been
rigorously and robustly falsified to any high degree of standard in
the physical sciences (see previous and next post). What about MOND
(theory B above)? It too is a physical theory allowing predictions. It
too can be ruled out.

Srikanth Togere Nagesh has put a large effort to track down and
document the published falsifications of MOND. It turns out that the
claimed falsifications of MOND have all been shown, in the published
scientific research literature via rebuttals, to be flawed.

It is astonishing that there is a deep mystery and controversy about
something as apparently simple as the dynamics of our galaxy, the
Milky Way. This is not a problem with something esoteric like quantum
field theory or general relativity, this is a problem at the level of
simple high school physics, ie, Newton’s laws and gravity. It is not
about disagreements between theory and experiment of fractions of a
percent, but, rather, 5-to-10-fold errors.

I am referring to the problem of the rate of the rotational velocity
of gases at the outer fringes of spiral galaxies.  The steady state
rotational velocity is the resultant of the balance between the
centrifugal force and the gravitational force from the mass of the
rest of the galaxy. The observed velocity is greater by a factor of
two or more than is predicted from Newton’s laws and the known
experimental mass density of the stars, gases and dust. To account for
this using standard Newtonian theory, it is necessary to postulate
that there is some extra missing mass, representing about 75% of the
total galaxy gravitational mass, that is made of some exotic
particle(s) referred to as “cold dark matter” (CDM). Despite enormous
experimental efforts to directly detect CDM, representing hundreds of
sophisticated searches using everything from the large hadron collider
at CERN to exotic underground detectors, all have come up with
absolutely nothing..

The alternative, Modified Newtonian Dynamics, MOND theory was first
proposed in 1983 by Mordehai Milgrom (2-4). In place of postulating
missing mass to account for the rotational gravitational force,
Milgrom proposed that, for the extremely small gravitational force
(and resulting rotational acceleration) at the outer fringes of
galaxies, Newton’s second law (Force = mass x acceleration or F = m
a)) does not apply and should be replaced with the modified relation:

$$
F = m s^2 / a_0
$$

where $a_0 \approx 1.2 x 10^{-10} m/sec^2$. Compared to CDM, this
modification provides a much simpler (fewer adjustable parameters) and
more accurate description of the galaxy rotation..
