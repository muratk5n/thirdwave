# A Nostalgia for Modernism

The title is taken from a book written about the mood of post 90s
secular citizens of the Turkish Republic. The fascist coup of 80 had
created the Islamoturkist ideology but it also wanted to balance it,
so the leaders made sure to alert the followers of the existing pure
Turkist followers to be "on guard" against the new newcomers, just in
case they behaved too Islamist for their own good.. This act ushered
in a resurgence of all things related to Kemal, a remembarence of the
man through symbols, displays of devotion, protests. The author
Ozyurek chose one photograph from such a protest where hard-core
adherents put on masks with the founders face on it, creating an eerie
display using the long-gone leader's image, likely creating an effect
opposite than was intented.

These riled-up followers, gazing through the dead-looking eyes of the
founder's picture, were visibly trying too hard to do something that
was beyond possible. A type of culture war was in display, as in US
around useless issues to hide away the abnormalities of the uniparty
that destroyed all ideologies related to economy and well-being, so
did this culture war, pitting one group against another, while hiding
away its own beastiality, its mindless expansion in commerce, and
errant nationalism. The nostalgia was for the 1920s foundational
spirit, when the only ideology remaining by then was Kemal's
consisting of a bizarre concoction of purebread race who was both
always in Anatolia and arrived later, who was the bringer of
civilization at the same time forgotten (until Kemal who reminded
everyone who they were), and once local and remote. But the ideology,
and the nostalgia for it later would become a mere tool, helped the
Anglo alliance and it was something to be activated as it was seen
fit.
