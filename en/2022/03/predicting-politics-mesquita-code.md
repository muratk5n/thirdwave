# Code for Predicting Politics

An attempt to replicate Dr. Mesquita's [book](predicting-politics-mesquita.md) was
made by David Massad in this [repo](https://github.com/dmasad/Agents-In-Conflict).
I took his code collated it to one script. The China simulation mentioned
by Massad and Mesquita in his book are below,

```python
import bdm, pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('ch.csv')
```

[TBD]
