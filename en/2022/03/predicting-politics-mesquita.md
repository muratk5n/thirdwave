# Predicting Politics

Bruce Mesquita

The model itself depicts a game in which actors simultaneously make
proposals and exert influence on one another. They then evaluate
options and build coalitions by shifting positions on the issue in
question. The above steps are repeated sequentially until the issue is
resolved... Resolution or breakdown occurs when the costs of continued
negotiation are estimated to exceed the expected benefits from such
continued discussions.

The model assumes that each player has the same time discount
rate. When the shift in the median voter position (or position based
on some other pertinent decision rule) predicted from one round to the
next is small enough, given the time discount rate, then the model
assumes bargaining ends. The outcome predicted at this point depends
upon the decision rule in force. If majority rule (or some
supermajority rule) is in force, then the policy outcome that
corresponds with the rule (e.g., the median voter's policy position at
the end of bargaining if majority rule is in force) is the predicted
outcome...

In the game, each player knows three factors: the potential power and
stated or inferred policy position of each actor on each issue
examined, and the salience each actor associates with those
issues. The decision makers, stakeholders, or players do not know how
much others value alternative outcomes or what perceptions others have
about their risks and opportunities. Each decision maker chooses
based on his or her perceptions and expectations, with these
perceptions and expectations about the play of others and the general
situation sometimes being in error.

Strategies in the game consist of sequences of policy proposals
(including no proposal) from each player to each other player.. In the
model discussed here, .. players are interested in maximizing their
welfare on [policy].

Decision makers care about the policy choice on the issue continuum
and so, from that perspective, are reluctant to move from the position
with which they have associated themselves to a position on the
opposite side of the median voter. However, they also are interested
in enhancing their personal welfare by being seen as instrumental in
helping to form a winning coalition. Naturally, the location of the
winning coalition may not be constrained to fall on the same side of
the issue continuum (relative to the median voter's position) as their
own stated negotiating stance. If a player values credit for helping
to forge a winning coalition sufficiently, then the player will be
prepared to shift positions, even moving to the opposite side of the
policy space provided doing so supplies sufficient utility regarding
credit for helping to "make a deal." Such a player can be attracted to
a new position without being coerced. Such a player may strike a
policy compromise with others in order to gain credit as the broker of
an agreement.

The issue examined in Table 3.1 [inputs are for political reform in
China, assuming the death of Deng Xiao Ping, the stances of each actor
on what to do next] greater centralization (position 0 on the scale)
or greater democratization (full democracy at position 100 on the
issue scale) in China..  The data were collected in October 1991.. I
display just five bargaining rounds here, but discuss twenty-five such
rounds for these data [later]. The first five rounds appear to paint
an optimistic picture of Chinese liberalization, a picture that is
diminished when we look farther out in time..
