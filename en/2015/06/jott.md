# Jott

Jott, a messaging app that works without a data plan or WiFi
connection, has caught on among junior high and high school students
[..] The reason? Teens who don’t have a data plan that will allow them
to text are using their iPods and iPads to message each other on a
closed network within a 100-foot area within school limits [..]

Text messages usually travel by way of your phone to the nearest cell
tower. Then they get routed to other cell towers to reach the person
you are texting. However, Jott can send messages from one device to
another without any cell service as long as those texting are within
close enough proximity to each other.

It does this by using something called a mesh network that operates on
Bluetooth low energy or using a router that can reach within 100 feet
of each user. It’s the same way FireChat, a group messaging app, does
this, but Jott can also message individuals within your network.

This is great - this kind of tech is closer to the spirit of 3W.
