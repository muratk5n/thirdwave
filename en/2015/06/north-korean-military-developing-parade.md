The Onion

Drawing on satellite data and foreign intelligence reports, Pentagon
officials confirmed Monday that North Korea was in the late stages of
developing a military parade with an operational range of 5,000
miles. “With its current capabilities, the DPRK could, at a moment’s
notice, deploy a lavish parade to the Japanese mainland or Guam,
potentially expanding the reach of its festivities to the West Coast
of the United States by year’s end,” said Deputy Secretary of Defense
Robert O. Work, who explained that the communist dictatorship had
bolstered its arsenal of massive full-color Kim Jong-il and Kim
Il-sung banners, and that its top choreographers were drilling
soldiers on how to maneuver in dazzling synchronized formations for
maximum visual effect.
