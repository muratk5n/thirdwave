# Chinese Robots Eating Jobs

Over the last decade, China has become, in the eyes of much of the
world, a job-eating monster, consuming entire industries with its
seemingly limitless supply of low-wage workers. But the reality is
that China is now shifting its appetite to robots, a transition that
will have significant consequences for China’s economy — and the
world’s.

In 2014, Chinese factories accounted for about a quarter of the global
ranks of industrial robots — a 54 percent increase over
2013. According to the International Federation of Robotics, it will
have more installed manufacturing robots than any other country by
2017.
