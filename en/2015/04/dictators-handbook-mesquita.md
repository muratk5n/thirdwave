# The Dictator's Handbook

Mesquita

[P]olitics is not terribly complicated. But by the same measure,
history’s most revered political philosophers haven’t explained it
very well...

The modern vernacular of politics and international relations, from
balances of power and hegemony to partisanship and national interest,
is the stuff of high school civics and nightly news punditry. It has
little to do with real politics. And so, you may be delighted—or
disappointed—to hear that this particular book of politics is not
concerned with any of this. Our account of politics is primarily about
what is, and why what is, is. In this book, we hope to explain the
most fundamental and puzzling questions about politics, and in the
process give all of us a better way to think about why the worlds of
rulers and subjects, of authorities and rights, of war and peace, and,
in no small way, of life and death all work in the ways that they
do. And maybe, just maybe, from time to time we will see paths to
betterment...

The etymology of monarchy may be “rule by one,” but such rule does
not, has not, and cannot exist. Louis is thought famously (and
probably falsely) to have proclaimed, *L’etat, c’est moi*: the state,
it is me. This declaration is often used to describe political life
for supposedly absolute monarchs like Louis, likewise for tyrannical
dictators. The declaration of absolutism, however, is never true. No
leader, no matter how august or how revered, no matter how cruel or
vindictive, ever stands alone. Indeed, Louis XIV, ostensibly an
absolute monarch, is a wonderful example of just how false this idea
of monolithic leadership is..

For leaders, the political landscape can be broken down into three
groups of people: the nominal selectorate, the real selectorate, and
the winning coalition. The nominal selectorate includes every person
who has at least some legal say in choosing their leader. In the
United States it is everyone eligible to vote, meaning all citizens
aged eighteen and over...

In the USSR the winning coalition consisted of a small group of people
inside the Communist Party who chose candidates and who controlled
policy.

Fundamentally, the nominal selectorate is the pool of potential
support for a leader; the real selectorate includes those whose
support is truly influential; and the winning coalition extends only
to those essential supporters without whom the leader would be
finished. A simple way to think of these groups is: interchangeables,
influentials, and essentials...

Remember that large-coalition leaders must keep a broad swath of the
people happy. In war that turns out to mean that democrats must care
about the people and, of course, soldiers are people. Although
conflict involves putting soldiers at risk, democrats do what they can
to mitigate such risk. In autocracies, foot soldiers are not
politically important. Autocrats do not waste resources protecting
them.

The difference in expenditures per soldier is greater even than the
numbers alone indicate. The Israeli military, like the military of
democracies in general, spends a lot of its money on buying equipment
that is heavily armored to protect soldiers. Better training and
equipment enable democracies to leverage the impact of each soldier so
they can achieve the same military output while at the same time
putting few soldiers at risk. The Egyptian military’s tanks, troop
transports, and other equipment were lightly and cheaply armored. They
preferred to spend money on private rewards with which to ensure the
loyalty of the generals and colonels.

Fidel and Che

Lest there be doubt that those who share the risks of coming to power
often are then thrown aside—or worse—let us reflect on the
all-too-typical case of the backers of Fidel Castro’s revolution in
Cuba. Of the twenty-one ministers appointed by Castro in January 1959,
immediately after the success of his revolution, twelve had resigned
or had been ousted by the end of the year. Four more were removed in
1960 as Castro further consolidated his hold on power. These people,
once among Fidel’s closest, most intimate backers, ultimately faced
the two big exes of politics. For the luckier among them, divorce from
Castro came in the form of exile. For others, it meant execution. This
includes even Castro’s most famous fellow revolutionary, Che Guevara.

Che may have been second in power only to Fidel himself. Indeed, that
was likely his greatest fault. Castro forced Che out of Cuba in 1965
partly because of Che’s popularity, which made him a potential rival
for authority. Castro sent Che on a mission to Bolivia, but towards
the end of March 1967 Castro simply cut off Guevara’s support, leaving
him stranded... Che Guevara was killed in Bolivia but at least he
escaped the ignominy of execution by his revolutionary ally, Fidel
Castro. Humberto Sori Marin was not so ‘fortunate.’ Marin, the
commander of Castro’s rebel army, was accused of conspiring against
the revolution. In April 1961, like so many other erstwhile backers of
Fidel Castro, he too was executed."

Political transitions are filled with examples of supporters who help
a leader to power only to be replaced. This is true whether we look at
national or local governments, corporations, organized crime families,
or, for that matter, any other organization.

Iran

Iran’s corruption ranking in 2010 was the thirty-second worst (that
is, it ranked 146 out of 178 countries in honest business dealings),
making it one of the more corrupt regimes in the world [..] Per capita
income [..] in Iran [is] only $4,530. Thus, despite its vast oil
wealth, Iranians, on average earn [very little]. Tax rates are high
[.. they] extract more income tax [.. and have] progressive income
taxes although a small group in Iran, known as the Bonyads, is exempt
from taxation and even exempt from accusations of corruption. They
manage the money of the senior ayatollahs and some key military
leaders. The Bonyads are reputed to control 20 to 25 percent of Iran’s
annual income—not bad as private benefits go.
