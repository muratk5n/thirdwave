# The Dictator's Handbook

Mesquita

[P]olitics is not terribly complicated. But by the same measure,
history’s most revered political philosophers haven’t explained it
very well...

The modern vernacular of politics and international relations, from
balances of power and hegemony to partisanship and national interest,
is the stuff of high school civics and nightly news punditry. It has
little to do with real politics. And so, you may be delighted—or
disappointed—to hear that this particular book of politics is not
concerned with any of this. Our account of politics is primarily about
what is, and why what is, is. In this book, we hope to explain the
most fundamental and puzzling questions about politics, and in the
process give all of us a better way to think about why the worlds of
rulers and subjects, of authorities and rights, of war and peace, and,
in no small way, of life and death all work in the ways that they
do. And maybe, just maybe, from time to time we will see paths to
betterment...

The etymology of monarchy may be “rule by one,” but such rule does
not, has not, and cannot exist. Louis is thought famously (and
probably falsely) to have proclaimed, *L’etat, c’est moi*: the state,
it is me. This declaration is often used to describe political life
for supposedly absolute monarchs like Louis, likewise for tyrannical
dictators. The declaration of absolutism, however, is never true. No
leader, no matter how august or how revered, no matter how cruel or
vindictive, ever stands alone. Indeed, Louis XIV, ostensibly an
absolute monarch, is a wonderful example of just how false this idea
of monolithic leadership is..

For leaders, the political landscape can be broken down into three
groups of people: the nominal selectorate, the real selectorate, and
the winning coalition. The nominal selectorate includes every person
who has at least some legal say in choosing their leader. In the
United States it is everyone eligible to vote, meaning all citizens
aged eighteen and over...

In the USSR the winning coalition consisted of a small group of people
inside the Communist Party who chose candidates and who controlled
policy.

Fundamentally, the nominal selectorate is the pool of potential
support for a leader; the real selectorate includes those whose
support is truly influential; and the winning coalition extends only
to those essential supporters without whom the leader would be
finished. A simple way to think of these groups is: interchangeables,
influentials, and essentials...

<a name='war'/>

Remember that large-coalition leaders must keep a broad swath of the
people happy. In war that turns out to mean that democrats must care
about the people and, of course, soldiers are people. Although
conflict involves putting soldiers at risk, democrats do what they can
to mitigate such risk. In autocracies, foot soldiers are not
politically important. Autocrats do not waste resources protecting
them.

The difference in expenditures per soldier is greater even than the
numbers alone indicate. The Israeli military, like the military of
democracies in general, spends a lot of its money on buying equipment
that is heavily armored to protect soldiers. Better training and
equipment enable democracies to leverage the impact of each soldier so
they can achieve the same military output while at the same time
putting few soldiers at risk. 5 The Egyptian military’s tanks, troop
transports, and other equipment were lightly and cheaply armored. They
preferred to spend money on private rewards with which to ensure the
loyalty of the generals and colonels.

Castro

Lest there be doubt that those who share the risks of coming to power
often are then thrown aside—or worse—let us reflect on the
all-too-typical case of the backers of Fidel Castro’s revolution in
Cuba. Of the twenty-one ministers appointed by Castro in January 1959,
immediately after the success of his revolution, twelve had resigned
or had been ousted by the end of the year. Four more were removed in
1960 as Castro further consolidated his hold on power. These people,
once among Fidel’s closest, most intimate backers, ultimately faced
the two big exes of politics. For the luckier among them, divorce from
Castro came in the form of exile. For others, it meant execution. This
includes even Castro’s most famous fellow revolutionary, Che Guevara.

Che may have been second in power only to Fidel himself. Indeed, that
was likely his greatest fault. Castro forced Che out of Cuba in 1965
partly because of Che’s popularity, which made him a potential rival
for authority. Castro sent Che on a mission to Bolivia, but towards
the end of March 1967 Castro simply cut off Guevara’s support, leaving
him stranded. Captain Gary Prado Salmon, the Bolivian officer who
captured Che, confirmed that Guevara told him that the decision to
come to Bolivia was not his own, it was Castro’s. One of Fidel’s
biographers remarked, "in a very real sense Che followed in the
shadows of Frank Pais, Camilo Cienfuegos, Huber Matos, and Humberto
Sori Marin [all close backers of Castro during the revolution]. Like
them, he was viewed by Castro as a ‘competitor’ for power and like
them, he had to be moved aside ‘in one manner or another.’ Che Guevara
was killed in Bolivia but at least he escaped the ignominy of
execution by his revolutionary ally, Fidel Castro. Humberto Sori Marin
was not so ‘fortunate.’ Marin, the commander of Castro’s rebel army,
was accused of conspiring against the revolution. In April 1961, like
so many other erstwhile backers of Fidel Castro, he too was executed."

Political transitions are filled with examples of supporters who help
a leader to power only to be replaced. This is true whether we look at
national or local governments, corporations, organized crime families,
or, for that matter, any other organization.

Iran

Iran’s corruption ranking in 2010 was the thirty-second worst (that
is, it ranked 146 out of 178 countries in honest business dealings),
making it one of the more corrupt regimes in the world [..] Per capita
income [..] in Iran [is] only $4,530. Thus, despite its vast oil
wealth, Iranians, on average earn [very little]. Tax rates are high
[.. they] extract more income tax [.. and have] progressive income
taxes although a small group in Iran, known as the Bonyads, is exempt
from taxation and even exempt from accusations of corruption. They
manage the money of the senior ayatollahs and some key military
leaders. The Bonyads are reputed to control 20 to 25 percent of Iran’s
annual income—not bad as private benefits go.

Debt, Aid

[W]e saw the paradoxical result that as Nigeria’s oil revenues grew so
did its debt. It wasn’t that the oil itself encouraged
borrowing—autocrats always want to borrow more. Rather revenues from
oil meant that Nigeria could service a larger debt and so people were
more willing to lend. [..]

Although the large coalition size in a democracy places some
restrictions on the level of borrowing, democratic leaders are still
inclined to be financially irresponsible. Remember, while the debt is
paid by all, the benefits disproportionately flow to coalition
members. Over the last ten years the economies of many Western nations
boomed. This would have been a perfect time to reduce debt. Yet in
many cases this did not happen. [..]

From a Keynesian perspective, many governments are taking the perverse
steps of trying to cut spending during a recession instead of
stimulating demand. This does not reflect a desire by politicians to
borrow less. Rather debt crises in Iceland, Greece, and Ireland have
led many investors to doubt the ability of nations to repay. This has
pushed up the cost of borrowing and made it much harder to secure new
loans. It is supply, not demand, that has shrunk.

Markets limit how much a nation can borrow. If individuals borrow too
much and either cannot or will not repay it, then banks and other
creditors can seize assets to recover the debt. With sovereign lending
to countries, however, creditors cannot repossess property. [..] In
practice, the only leverage lenders have over nations is to cut them
off from future credit. Nevertheless, this has a profound effect, as
the ability to engage in borrowing in financial markets is
valuable. For this reason nations generally pay their debt.

However, once the value of access to credit is worth less than the
cost of servicing the debt then leaders should default. If they don’t
then surely a challenger will come along who will offer to do so. [..]

As debt approaches the balance point where the value of access to
credit equals the cost of debt service, lenders refuse to increase the
overall size of debt. At this point, if leaders want to borrow more,
then they need to increase revenues such that they could service this
additional debt. As in the Nigerian case, the discovery of exploitable
natural resources provides one means to increase debt service and
hence more borrowing. However, without such discoveries, the only way
to increase borrowing is to increase tax revenue. For autocratic
leaders this means liberalizing their policies to encourage people to
work harder because they already tax at a high (implicit) rate. Only
when facing financial problems are leaders willing to even consider
undertaking such politically risky liberalization. They don’t do it
frequently or happily. They liberalize, opening the door to a more
democratic, representative and accountable government only when they
have no other path to save themselves from being deposed today [..]

Debt forgiveness is a popular policy, but one that is generally
misguided. Those in favor of forgiving the debt of highly indebted
poor countries argue that the debt burden falls on the poor people of
the nation who did not benefit in a consequential way from the
borrowed funds. This is certainly true. As we have explained, the
benefits go to the leader and the coalition while the debt obligation
falls on everyone. But people who argue for debt forgiveness construct
their arguments in terms of how they think the world should operate,
rather than how it actually works.

[I]t is useful to look back at some of the largest debt-relief efforts
prior to 2000. It is particularly illustrative to observe how
important the nature of governance is. Even though creditors carefully
chose those nations that they thought would behave sensibly, in the
wake of debt relief many nations started increasing debt again.

As a percentage of debt, the largest debt reliefs prior to 2000 were
given to Ethiopia in 1999 (42 percent of debt), Yemen in 1997 (34
percent), Belarus in 1996 (33 percent), Angola in 1996 (33 percent),
Nicaragua in 1996 (30 percent) and Mozambique in 1990 (27
percent). With the exceptions of Angola and Nicaragua, each of these
nations promptly started reaccumulating debt. For instance, after a
series of small debt reductions, in 1999, with the forgiveness of $4.4
billion, Ethiopia had its debt reduced to $5.7 billion. But by 2003
this debt had risen to $6.9 billion. Despite the forgiveness of $589
million of debt in 1996, Belarus’s debt has steadily risen from $1.8
billion in 1995 to over $4.1 billion in 2005. Even though
debt-reduction programs vet candidates, these examples suggest that in
many cases forgiveness without institutional reform simply allows
leaders to start borrowing again.
