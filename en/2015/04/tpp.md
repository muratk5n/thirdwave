"Congress just introduced legislation to “Fast Track” the Trans-Pacific 
Partnership, or TPP. It’s a secretive deal, negotiated behind closed 
doors by government bureaucrats and corporate lobbyists, containing 
dangerous provisions (like SOPA) that threaten Internet freedom 
everywhere. Internet users deserve a say in decisions that affect us".

Some ppl are not happy it seems.
