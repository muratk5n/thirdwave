# Poor Egypt

Daron Acemoglu, *Why Nations Fail*

[Egyptians] recognize that the roots of these problems are
political. All the economic impediments they face stem from the way
political power in Egypt is exercised and monopolized by a narrow
elite. This, they understand, is the first thing that has to change.

Yet, in believing this, the protestors of Tahrir Square have sharply
diverged from the conventional wisdom on this topic.

When they reason about why a country such as Egypt is poor, most
academics and commentators emphasize completely different factors
[..Some] point to cultural attributes of Egyptians that are supposedly
inimical to economic development and prosperity. Egyptians, they
argue, lack the same sort of work ethic and cultural traits that have
allowed others to prosper, and instead have accepted Islamic beliefs
that are inconsistent with economic success. [Another] approach, the
one dominant among economists and policy pundits, is based on the
notion that the rulers of Egypt simply don’t know what is needed to
make their country prosperous, and have followed incorrect policies
and strategies in the past. If these rulers would only get the right
advice from the right advisers, the thinking goes, prosperity would
follow.

To these academics and pundits, the fact that Egypt has been ruled by
narrow elites feathering their nests at the expense of society seems
irrelevant to understanding the country’s economic problems.

In this book we’ll argue that the Egyptians in Tahrir Square, not most
academics and commentators, have the right idea. In fact, Egypt is
poor precisely because it has been ruled by a narrow elite that have
organized society for their own benefit at the expense of the vast
mass of people. Political power has been narrowly concentrated, and
has been used to create great wealth for those who possess it, such as
the $70 billion fortune apparently accumulated by ex-president
Mubarak. The losers have been the Egyptian people, as they only too
well understand.

We’ll show that this interpretation of Egyptian poverty, the people’s
interpretation, turns out to provide a general explanation for why
poor countries are poor. Whether it is North Korea, Sierra Leone, or
Zimbabwe, we’ll show that poor countries are poor for the same reason
that Egypt is poor.

[Rich c]ountries [..]  became rich because their citizens overthrew
the elites who controlled power and created a society where political
rights were much more broadly distributed, where the government was
accountable and responsive to citizens, and where the great mass of
people could take advantage of economic opportunities [..] People
fought for and won more political rights, and they used them to expand
their economic opportunities. The result was a fundamentally different
political and economic trajectory, culminating in the Industrial
Revolution.

The Industrial Revolution [a good thing a few centuries ago] and the
technologies it unleashed didn’t spread to Egypt, as that country was
under the control of the Ottoman Empire, which treated Egypt in rather
the same way as the Mubarak family later did. Ottoman rule in Egypt
was overthrown by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1798, but the country then
fell under the control of British colonialism, which had as little
interest as the Ottomans in promoting Egypt’s prosperity. Though the
Egyptians shook off the Ottoman and British empires and, in 1952,
overthrew their monarchy, these were not revolutions like that of 1688
in England, and rather than fundamentally transforming politics in
Egypt, they brought to power another elite as disinterested in
achieving prosperity for ordinary Egyptians as the Ottoman and British
had been. In consequence, the basic structure of society did not
change, and Egypt stayed poor.
