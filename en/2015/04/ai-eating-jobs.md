# Robotics Eating Jobs

2011 [Masterchef] winner Tim Anderson has spent the last two years helping to devise the ultimate kitchen gadget – a pair of robotic arms which can whip up any meal with the skill and flair of a professional chef.

Although it is currently just a prototype which uses the hob, developers Moley Robotics are planning commercial versions which will link up to the fridge, oven and even the dishwasher, so it can clean up afterwards.

To create the device Anderson was filmed in 3D stirring liquids, chopping vegetables even controlling the temperature of the hob.

His actions were then translated into digital movement using algorithms created with the help of Stanford University.

The robot not only cooks like Anderson, but it signs off its work with an ok gesture, just like the chef. It can even make a crab bisque.

“To be honest, I didn’t think this was possible,” said Anderson who has worked at Le Gavroche and the Fat Duck and owns his own pop-up restaurant Nanban in London. “I chose crab bisque as a dish because it’s a real challenge for human chef to make well, never mind a machine.

“Having seen – and tasted – the results for myself, I am stunned. This is the beginning of something really significant: a whole new opportunity for producing good food and for peopleto explore the world’s cuisines. It’s very exciting.” [..]

The prototype has been 18 years in development and is currently on show at the world’s biggest robotics show, Hanover Messe.

Moley Robotics, which is headquartered in the UK, is now working to scale the technology ready for mass production and installation in regular sized kitchens and want to create an iTunes style recipe book where dishes can be downloaded for the robot hands to cook [..]

The mass-market product will be supported by a digital library of over 2000 dishes when it launches in 2017 and they hope that celebrity chefs will embrace 3D cooking downloads [..].

Home chefs will also be able to upload their favourite recipes too [..].

“Whether you love food and want to explore different cuisines, or fancy saving a favourite family recipe for everyone to enjoy for years to come, the Automated Kitchen can do this,” he said.
