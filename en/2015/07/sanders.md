Bernie Sanders on Obamacare.. what he says amounts to an attack on Hillary from the left. He calls Obamacare "a Romney style plan" labeling it  un-Democrat in the process -- he is good, Bamacare was in fact based on  Mitt's model, but Mitt  said repeatedly the same ideas are not suitable at national level. Anyway - but he is correct in stating Obamacare is overengineered pile of crap [paraphrasing] and the public would be better served with a single-payer system, like the one Canada.
