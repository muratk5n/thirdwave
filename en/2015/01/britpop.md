David Cameron says there should be no "means of communication" which
"we cannot read" -- and no doubt many in his party will agree with
him, politically. But if they understood the technology, they would be
shocked to their boots [..]If your Whatsapp or Google Hangouts has a
deliberately introduced flaw in it, then foreign spies, criminals,
crooked police [..] , and criminals will eventually discover this
vulnerability [..]But this is just for starters. David Cameron doesn't
understand technology very well, so he doesn't actually know what he's
asking for.For David Cameron's proposal to work, he will need to stop
Britons from installing software that comes from software creators who
are out of his jurisdiction. The very best in secure communications
are already free/open source projects, maintained by thousands of
independent programmers around the world. They are widely available,
and thanks to things like cryptographic signing, it is possible to
download these packages from any server in the world (not just big
ones like Github) and verify, with a very high degree of confidence,
that the software you've downloaded hasn't been tampered with.Cameron
is not alone here. The regime he proposes is already in place in
countries like Syria, Russia, and Iran (for the record, none of these
countries have had much luck with it) [..]
