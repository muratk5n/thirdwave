Physics

Why does gravity exist? What are light waves?.. Physics has provided
no answers to these and many other basic questions concerning our
Universe.  You might even say that physics has failed to discover the
very nature of our Universe. While the fundamental forces existing in
our Universe have indeed been detected, and the laws describing these
forces have generally been documented, the nature of these forces
remains a total mystery. Why has the science of physics not made more
progress in unveiling the workings of our Universe?

To find the answer to this question we must look back in time to the
early 1890s. It was then that a couple of perplexing problems first
arose in physics. The British physicist Lord Kelvin referred to these
problems as two 'nineteenth century clouds' over physics. When
physicists grappled with these problems, the conclusions they arrived
at set physics on a path that quickly descended into a labyrinth from
which physics has still not escaped.

Although physics can be employed successfully today on a practical
level, the foundations of physics now rest on quicksand. As the Nobel
prize winning physicist Richard Feynman observed, 'It’s a terrible
mix-up, and you might say it’s a hopeless mess physics has got itself
worked into.'

The picture of reality that physics currently paints is so bizarre
and, frankly, so unbelievable, that beginning students in physics when
confronted with this picture can be excused from exclaiming 'You can’t
be serious!' Unfortunately, the Alice-in-Wonderland worldview created
by modern physics has done little to achieve a better understanding of
the real Universe.  And, yes, there is a real Universe.

Deciphering secrets of the real Universe requires taking a new look at
some of the problems that plagued physicists over 100 years ago. As we
revisit these problems, we will find that it is possible to arrive at
conclusions quite different from those obtained many years
ago. Moreover, with our new insight into these problems, we can begin
to unravel some of the mysteries of our Universe that have puzzled
mankind for centuries

QM

Two Slits Open for a Single Photon.. In such an experiment, a single
photon from the light source will still be incident on both slits in
the aperture screen at the same time, and will produce two coherent
sinusoidal wavelets that interfere constructively and destructively.
Each of these sinusoidal wavelets will have less energy than a photon
of the same frequency, and so the wavelets will not be
photons. Moreover, the energy of the two sinusoidal wavelets will
generally not be equal.

When the sinusoidal wavelets reach the image screen, the destructively
interfering parts of the sinusoidal wavelets will have significantly
less energy than a photon of the same frequency, and so will be unable
to produce an observable photographic or photoelectric effect. Dark
fringes will result.  Only the constructively interfering parts of the
sinusoidal wavelets will have sufficient energy (approximately the
energy of a photon of the same frequency) to produce an observable
photographic or photoelectric effect that will contribute to forming
bright fringes on the image screen. Moreover, a constructively
interfering part of the sinusoidal wavelet must strike an atom on the
image screen just right to provide sufficient energy for the atom to
change state and eject a single electron.

Out of hundreds of interfering parts of the two wavelets, only one
pair will generally produce any observable effect. This effect will
usually be isolated to a single atom on the image screen. Therefore,
the constructively interfering wavelets will appear to be very
localized (at a point) similar to a single particle striking the image
screen. Nevertheless, the change occurring in an atom of the image
screen in a low-intensity experiment is due to constructively
interfering sinusoidal wavelets; not to a particle

Maxwell

Maxwell’s electromagnetic field equations for free space can be
derived from classical elasticity theory as applied to transverse
elastic waves propagating in a perfectly elastic aether..

QM Inconsistency

[Niels Bohr's] first postulated constraint is inconsistent
with classical mechanics, which permits any of a continuum of orbital
paths around the nucleus. The second constraint is inconsistent with
classical electromagnetism, which requires that accelerating electrons
radiate electro-magnetic energy that should be detectable... By
adopting these postulates, Bohr effectively assumed that neither
classical mechanics nor classical electromagnetism is applicable at
the scale of atomic dimensions..

The atomic model initially developed by chemists to explain the
formation and structure of molecules generally differed from the
atomic model developed by physicists primarily in one important
respect: the chemist’s atomic model was static..

From a theorem developed by Earnshaw (1842), we know that stable
equilibrium cannot be attained by a system of stationary point charges
interacting only according to Coulomb’s inverse-square force law...
Electrostatic equilibrium cannot exist by itself. Therefore, the force
keeping atomic electrons from falling into the nucleus cannot simply
be electromagnetic force. Moreover, since the atomic electrons are not
accelerating, the force keeping the atomic electrons from falling into
the nucleus cannot be centrifugal force. Only one possibility remains:
we must conclude that the force keeping the atomic electrons from
falling into the nucleus is the weak nuclear force...

The atom is static as proposed in early atomic models developed by
chemists.. Atoms are observed to possess a very great stability. This
stability can now be seen as the natural result of electron positions
in an atom generally corresponding to a minimum energy
configuration. Classical physics can explain both the stability and
structure of the atom..

Gravitation

Newton’s force law can be used to derive Poisson’s gravitational field
equation. Moreover, since Newton’s force law of gravity is not a
function of time, Poisson’s field equation of gravity only applies to
gravitational fields that are stationary. Therefore, Poisson’s field
equation of gravity and Newton’s force law of gravity must be
mathematically equivalent for a stationary gravitational field... The
physical interpretation of Poisson’s field equation of gravity is,
however, very different from the physical interpretation of Newton’s
force law of gravity. Rather than the action-at-a-distance
interpretation of gravity obtained from Newton’s force law of gravity,
Poisson’s field equation is based upon and must be interpreted in
terms of the existence of a physical medium consisting of contiguous
particles about any material body [aether!]

Relativity

Having concluded that time in our Universe is a result of the flow of
aether into matter, we see that time cannot be modified in any way
(shortened or lengthened). Time is then uniform and absolute
throughout our Universe and is independent of the kinematic properties
and spatial position of any observer. Since absolute motion
(acceleration) exists in our Universe, it is to be expected that
absolute time must also exist.  Time is not relative, and time does to
alter with the motion of any reference system.

We see, therefore, that Einstein’s special theory of relativity, with
its kinematically dependent time, cannot be correct. We also see that,
while Newton was correct in postulating the existence of absolute
time, he was incorrect in assuming that such time is independent of
anything external.  Aether provides not only the absolute frame of
reference in our Universe, but also (together with matter) the
absolute time in our Universe. Time is not, then, a fundamental entity
of our Universe..

Spooky QM

[Quantum action-at-a-distance] experiments performed using Bell’s test
have generally used photons as the ‘particles’ and the polarization of
photons as the discrete parameter. Photons are transverse waves,
however, and not particles. Since the waves are split by the
polarizer, the emerging waves are generally not photons. Their energy
is no longer defined by their frequency. It is not clear that all
factors influencing the results of Bell’s test have been fully
understood as yet...

[T]he quantum exists because aether cannot support nonlinear
elasticity. Since the maximum amplitude of a wave propagating in
aether is fixed, the frequency of the wave must correspond to (be
proportional to) the energy $\mathcal{E}$... Physical properties of
aether then explain why higher energy light waves take the form of
quanta and always have the same distinct sinusoidal amplitude for a
given frequency.  A photon is therefore a monochromatic,
finite-length, constant-amplitude, transverse sinusoidal wave train in
aether having a single frequency v and quantized energy $\mathcal{E}$
given by $\mathcal{E} = hv$. All photons have the same distinct
constant amplitude. Each photon is characterized, therefore, not by
its amplitude, but by its frequency

Higgs

A Higgs particle can never be directly detected. It is thought to
exist for only about 10 − 22 seconds. The existence of Higgs particles
can only be inferred from indirect evidence. This inferential process
involves examining the decay products of high energy particle
collisions that occur within a particle accelerator in a search for a
certain decay pattern that has been predicted for Higgs
particles. Because of the massive amount of data produced in these
high energy collisions, extensive data filtering is performed before
any search for decay patterns even begins. Statistical methods are
then used to detect Higgs particles based on a theoretical model known
as the Standard Model of particle physics. If more decay patterns are
found having the expected Higgs decay pattern than predicted by the
Standard Model assuming Higgs particles do not exist, then the
existence of Higgs particles is inferred.

In 2013 the existence of Higgs particles was inferred based upon such
indirect evidence. Clearly the validity of this inference depends not
only on the functioning of the extreme amount of computer filtering
necessary to obtain a meaningful signal from the immense
collision-created noise background, but also on the validity of the
Standard Model.. The Standard Model has many problems, however, and is
almost certainly wrong.. Ironically, the inferred existence of the
Higgs particle is now being used to argue for the validity of the
Standard Model
