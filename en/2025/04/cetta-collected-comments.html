<p>This paper provides elements in support of the random zero-point
radiation field (ZPF) as an essential ontological ingredient needed to
explain distinctive properties of quantum-mechanical systems. We show
that when an otherwise classical particle is connected to the ZPF, a
drastic, qualitative change in the dynamics takes place, leading
eventually to the quantum dynamics...</p>
<p>[An] inspection of the current literature readily reveals the
existence of about two dozen different interpretations of QM, some
more popular than others, and none of them experimentally
verified. How can it be that a fundamental theory that provides the
basis for a most significant part of contemporary physics, admits such
a variety of alternative, even contradictory interpretations? No
serious physicist or philosopher of science in his five senses would
claim to come up with a better interpretation of Newtonian mechanics
or Maxwellian electrodynamics. Reformulations of a known accepted
theory may appear, of course, but fundamental theories do not accept
reinterpretations. Special relativity did not reinterpret classical
mechanics, it extended mechanics to wider domains, and together with
quantum theory helped to specify its range of applicability. We should
conclude that in the case of quantum mechanics, such variety of
interpretations is indicative of a crucial underdetermination of the
theory...</p>
<p>[To] understand the origin of so many different visions about the same
fundamental theory, it is convenient to place ourselves in the context
in which QM was born. We recall that the quantum formalism—its
excellent mathematical apparatus that we still use today with
success—was born in the absence of a deep understanding of the quantum
phenomenology...</p>
<p>It is against this background that Heisenberg worked on his version of
the theory, the matrix mechanics. Heisenberg discovered that the
quantum particles have an unavoidable random behavior. Being persuaded
of the completeness of his theory, he took this randomness for an
essential, irreducible trait that neither needs nor admits a deeper
explanation...</p>
<p>Unknowingly, Schrödinger’s wave theory implied the introduction of a
new element into the quantum description. The point is that electron
interference patterns are produced by the accumulation of a high
number of point-like events, each one created by a single electron. A
single particle produces an isolated, randomly located bright point on
the detecting screen, the interference—the wave manifestation—becoming
evident only after very many hits. The conclusion—normally one that
goes unnoticed—is that Schrödinger’s wave function refers not to a
single particle, but to an ensemble of them. Well interpreted,
Schrödinger theory is intrinsically statistical in nature, and deals
with ensembles rather than individual particles.  Nevertheless, the
statistical perspective of the quantum phenomenon was dismissed in
general—and adamantly opposed by the Copenhagen school in particular,
which prevails to date under different guises.. This opened the door
to another infelicitous ingredient, the observer. The introduction of
an active character in order to ’explain’ the reduction of the
distinctive quantum mixtures to the pure states observed, added a
subjective ingredient to the already odd quantum scheme.  All in all,
such variety of interpretations and re-interpretations indicates that
something of importance is missing in the theory. Having so many
variations indicates that the issue is actually not one of
interpretation, but of an essential incompleteness. The absence of an
appropriate guiding ontological element has turned the physical
situation into a mystery...</p>
<p>However, rather than [an] incompletenesses.. we are referring to an
essential ingredient that is missing. The point is that whatever is to
be added to the incomplete theoretical framework should be able to
address simultaneously some of its main puzzles, including not just
the nature of quantum fluctuations; atomic stability, quantum
transitions, discrete atomic spectra, wavelike phenomena and the like
should find their natural explanation in a coherent scheme.</p>
<p>The present paper is one of a series that deals with the development
of stochastic electrodynamics (SED) as a physical foundation for
quantum mechanics. In previous work we have shown that, by including
the zero-point radiation field (ZPF), SED allows us to arrive at a
consistent description of the stationary states and to derive the
(nonrelativistic) radiative corrections proper for QED.</p>
<p>The Quantum Dice</p>
<p>Let us consider a box that is divided into two smaller equal boxes L
and R by means of a movable wall. Assume that inside the big box there
is a (single) particle... We ask a simple question: Where is the
particle? Even though it would be difficult to pose a simpler
question, physicists are imaginative enough as to have begotten a full
range of answers to it; however, since our interest lies in the
fundamental content of those answers, we may abstract the details and
reduce them to just the two that catch the main tendencies. So, where
is the particle?..</p>
<p>The conventional description [is this] basic tenet of the conventional
interpretation of quantum mechanics is that the wave function affords
a complete description of each individual system... this means that
the wave function refers to the one particle inside the big box and
the answer to the above question depends on whether we have observed
the interior or not. Previous to any observation the state is
<em>completely</em> described by stating that the probability of the particle
being in any of the two boxes L or R is $\frac{1}{2}$; there is no
more to that. Thus, the particle is in a state of indeterminate
localization (delocalized) in the big box. By looking inside (making a
measurement to know its whereabouts) we perturb the system and bring
it into a new state, (objectively) localized either in box L or in box
R. The transformation of the wave function from the (pre-observation)
indeterminate localization state to the (post-observation) determinate
state constitutes the reduction or collapse of the wave function,
brought about by the observation. Whether the particle ends up in box
L or in box R after the measurement, is a matter of chance.</p>
<p>The assumption that the wave function refers to a single system thus
has enormous consequences. Quantities such as $\Delta x$
(uncertainties in the conventional language) become objective
restrictions on the localization of the particle, meaning that there
exist intrinsic limitations on the corresponding measurements. So,
quantum mechanics goes as far as is possible and physicists must
renounce once and for all the hope for a detailed description of the
individual. Further, since the concept of probability is being applied
to a single event and no sample space can be constructed, there is no
consistent way of viewing the result as a property of the system, and
it must be interpreted as an uncertainty of our knowledge. The
observer slips thus into the description, and the fundamental
principle that physics refers to the world rather than to our
knowledge of it, is eroded"</p>
<p>The Emerging Quantum</p>
<p>[In] 1963..  physicist Trevor Marshall published a paper in the
Proceedings of the Royal Society under the short title <em>Random
Electrodynamics</em>—an intriguing title, at that time. To date this paper
has received just over four citations per year, which means it is
alive, but not as present as it could be, considering the perspectives
it opened for theoretical physics.  Shortly thereafter a related paper
was published by..Timothy Boyer, under the longer title <em>Quantum
Electromagnetic Zero-Point Energy and Retarded Dispersion
Forces</em>. Boyer does not cite Marshall’s paper (although he does so in
his third paper, which is followed by a productive 50-year long work
in solitary), but instead he refers to the work of David Kershaw and
Edward Nelson on stochastic quantum mechanics. All these papers share
a central feature: they are based on conceiving quantum mechanics as a
stochastic process. Marshall mentions explicitly the existence of a
real, space-filling radiation zero-point field as the source of
stochasticity. Boyer sees a deep truth in this, and in a note added to
his manuscript he comments that '...in this sense, quantum motions are
experimental evidence for zero-point radiation.'</p>
<p>From a historical perspective, we recall.. in 1916.. Nernst had
proposed to consider atomic stability as experimental evidence for
Planck’s recently discovered zero-point radiation. This visionary idea
was largely ignored by the founders of quantum mechanics.. such is
history. Both Marshall and Boyer succeed in demonstrating that some
quantum phenomena can indeed be understood by the simple expedient of
adding this random zero-point field to the corresponding classical
description. Their pioneering work was soon followed by that of other
colleagues, moved by the conviction that the random zero-point field
has something important to tell us about quantum mechanics. Many other
results have been obtained during this period, which constitute the
essence of the theory largely known under the name of stochastic
electrodynamics.  At the same time, other researchers, notably Nelson,
dedicated their efforts to develop the phenomenological stochastic
theory of quantum mechanics.  The perception that quantumness and
stochasticity are but two different aspects of a reality, started to
gain support from several sides"</p>
