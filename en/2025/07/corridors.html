<h1>Corridors</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IMEC vs. BRI: This is the most direct and publicly acknowledged rivalry.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IMEC is seen as a Western-backed (US, EU) initiative, with
    India and Saudi Arabia as key partners, to counter China's
    growing influence through the BRI. It aims to offer an
    alternative, "values-based" infrastructure development model,
    often emphasizing transparency and sustainability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BRI, being China's ambitious flagship project, seeks to
    solidify its economic and geopolitical leadership across
    Eurasia. It has faced criticism regarding debt traps and lack
    of transparency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competition for investments and traffic: Both initiatives
    vie for the attention of countries along their proposed routes
    and aim to attract a significant share of global trade.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iraq Development Road vs. IMEC:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While not explicitly stated as rivals by all parties, the Iraq
  Development Road could be seen as a direct competitor to IMEC in
  terms of connecting the Middle East to Europe. Both aim to
  reduce transit times compared to traditional sea routes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turkey's prominent role in the Development Road, and its initial
  exclusion from IMEC discussions, highlights a potential
  divergence of interests. Turkey is actively trying to position
  itself as a key transit hub for East-West trade, which aligns
  with the Development Road's goals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Land Corridors vs. Sea Routes (e.g., Suez Canal):</p>
<ul>
<li>All these land-based corridors (IMEC, Development Road, Middle
  Corridor) aim to offer faster and potentially more secure
  alternatives to traditional maritime routes, particularly the
  Suez Canal, which has faced disruptions from conflicts (e.g.,
  Red Sea attacks) and congestion. This creates a natural
  competition for freight traffic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Middle Corridor vs. Northern Corridor (BRI through Russia): </p>
<ul>
<li>The Middle Corridor has gained significant traction due to the
  conflict in Ukraine, making the traditional Northern Corridor
  (through Russia) less desirable for many international companies
  due to sanctions and security concerns. This has led to a shift
  of traffic and investment towards the Middle Corridor"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>INTSC vs Alternative to Traditional Maritime Routes (Suez Canal):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The INSTC aims to provide a shorter and more cost-effective
  multimodal route (ship, rail, road) for moving freight between
  India, Iran, Russia, Central Asia, and Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It offers a direct challenge to the traditional Suez Canal route,
  which can be prone to disruptions (like the Ever Given incident) and
  security threats (like those in the Red Sea). The INSTC promises to
  reduce transit times by 40% and costs by 30% compared to the Suez
  Canal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>INTSC vs China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While not explicitly conceived as a counter to the BRI, the INSTC
  serves as an alternative for countries seeking to diversify their
  trade routes and reduce dependence on China's massive infrastructure
  project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For India, the INSTC is particularly strategic as it provides access
  to Central Asian markets and bypasses Pakistan, directly challenging
  the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which is part of the BRI
  and which India views as violating its sovereignty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, Russia sees the INSTC as a way to increase its influence
  in Central Asia and reduce reliance on Western-controlled trade
  routes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>INTSC Competition with Other Regional Corridors (e.g., Middle Corridor,
  IMEC):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Middle Corridor (Trans-Caspian International Transport Route):
This corridor, promoted by Turkey and passing through Azerbaijan,
the Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan, and China, also aims to connect East
and West. There's a debate on whether the INSTC and Middle
Corridor are rivals or potential partners. While they share
overlapping geographic reach in Central Asia, their success can
depend on cooperation, especially in terms of shared
infrastructure and reducing logistical costs. Turkey, by promoting
the Middle Corridor, aims to position itself as a major Eurasian
power, potentially limiting Iran's transit power.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC): Launched at the G20
summit in 2023 with support from the US, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and
Europe, IMEC is another significant rival. It aims to connect
India to Europe via the Persian Gulf and Israel, serving as a
direct competitor to both the Suez Canal and, to some extent, the
INSTC, particularly for India's trade with Europe. However, its
progress has been hindered by geopolitical instability in the
Middle East.</p>
