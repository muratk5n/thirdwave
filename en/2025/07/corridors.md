# Corridors

* IMEC vs. BRI: This is the most direct and publicly acknowledged rivalry.

    * IMEC is seen as a Western-backed (US, EU) initiative, with
        India and Saudi Arabia as key partners, to counter China's
        growing influence through the BRI. It aims to offer an
        alternative, "values-based" infrastructure development model,
        often emphasizing transparency and sustainability.
    
    * BRI, being China's ambitious flagship project, seeks to
        solidify its economic and geopolitical leadership across
        Eurasia. It has faced criticism regarding debt traps and lack
        of transparency.
    
    * Competition for investments and traffic: Both initiatives
        vie for the attention of countries along their proposed routes
        and aim to attract a significant share of global trade.

* Iraq Development Road vs. IMEC:

    * While not explicitly stated as rivals by all parties, the Iraq
      Development Road could be seen as a direct competitor to IMEC in
      terms of connecting the Middle East to Europe. Both aim to
      reduce transit times compared to traditional sea routes.
    
    * Turkey's prominent role in the Development Road, and its initial
      exclusion from IMEC discussions, highlights a potential
      divergence of interests. Turkey is actively trying to position
      itself as a key transit hub for East-West trade, which aligns
      with the Development Road's goals.
    
* Land Corridors vs. Sea Routes (e.g., Suez Canal):

    * All these land-based corridors (IMEC, Development Road, Middle
      Corridor) aim to offer faster and potentially more secure
      alternatives to traditional maritime routes, particularly the
      Suez Canal, which has faced disruptions from conflicts (e.g.,
      Red Sea attacks) and congestion. This creates a natural
      competition for freight traffic.

* Middle Corridor vs. Northern Corridor (BRI through Russia): 

    * The Middle Corridor has gained significant traction due to the
      conflict in Ukraine, making the traditional Northern Corridor
      (through Russia) less desirable for many international companies
      due to sanctions and security concerns. This has led to a shift
      of traffic and investment towards the Middle Corridor"

* INTSC vs Alternative to Traditional Maritime Routes (Suez Canal):

    * The INSTC aims to provide a shorter and more cost-effective
      multimodal route (ship, rail, road) for moving freight between
      India, Iran, Russia, Central Asia, and Europe.

    * It offers a direct challenge to the traditional Suez Canal route,
      which can be prone to disruptions (like the Ever Given incident) and
      security threats (like those in the Red Sea). The INSTC promises to
      reduce transit times by 40% and costs by 30% compared to the Suez
      Canal.

* INTSC vs China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI):

    * While not explicitly conceived as a counter to the BRI, the INSTC
      serves as an alternative for countries seeking to diversify their
      trade routes and reduce dependence on China's massive infrastructure
      project.

    * For India, the INSTC is particularly strategic as it provides access
      to Central Asian markets and bypasses Pakistan, directly challenging
      the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which is part of the BRI
      and which India views as violating its sovereignty.

    * Similarly, Russia sees the INSTC as a way to increase its influence
      in Central Asia and reduce reliance on Western-controlled trade
      routes.

* INTSC Competition with Other Regional Corridors (e.g., Middle Corridor,
  IMEC):

    * Middle Corridor (Trans-Caspian International Transport Route):
	This corridor, promoted by Turkey and passing through Azerbaijan,
	the Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan, and China, also aims to connect East
	and West. There's a debate on whether the INSTC and Middle
	Corridor are rivals or potential partners. While they share
	overlapping geographic reach in Central Asia, their success can
	depend on cooperation, especially in terms of shared
	infrastructure and reducing logistical costs. Turkey, by promoting
	the Middle Corridor, aims to position itself as a major Eurasian
	power, potentially limiting Iran's transit power.

    * India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC): Launched at the G20
	summit in 2023 with support from the US, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and
	Europe, IMEC is another significant rival. It aims to connect
	India to Europe via the Persian Gulf and Israel, serving as a
	direct competitor to both the Suez Canal and, to some extent, the
	INSTC, particularly for India's trade with Europe. However, its
	progress has been hindered by geopolitical instability in the
	Middle East.
