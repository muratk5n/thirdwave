# Experiments, Aether

1 - Optical-cavity (modern Michelson–Morley) test — search for an
aether wind / anisotropy of c

If there is a pervasive aether with flow into matter (a local
preferred frame / directional effect), the speed of light in vacuum
should show an anisotropy correlated with the aether flow direction or
local mass distribution — a direct observational signature of an
aether. Masse’s emphasizes a ubiquitous aethr and directional flows
into matter.

2 - Torsion-balance / precision balance test for gravitational
shielding or “aether flux” changes (Podkletnov-style idea, but
rigorous)

Masse’s model says aether flows into matter producing gravity. If
matter locally modifies aether flow (or some materials / states change
the flow), you could observe a change in gravitational acceleration or
apparent weight in a controlled geometry — effectively a
gravitational-field perturbation caused by a material/condition.

3 - Atom-interferometer gravimeter experiment — look for transient or
local deviations of g when matter state changes

If aether flows into matter continually, rapidly changing the local
matter state (e.g., rapid ionization, sudden mass redistribution, or
electromagnetic excitation) might alter local aether flux and produce
measurable transient changes in g. Atom interferometers are the most
sensitive lab tools for small, local changes in gravitational
acceleration. 

4 - Photon wavelet / single-photon interference tests — examine wave vs
particle claims experimentally

Masse states that photons are always transverse sinusoidal wavelets
and that particle descriptions are an unnecessary
misinterpretation. Quantum optics has robust single-photon tests
(Grangier et al., delayed-choice/quantum-eraser, single-photon
two-slit) that directly probe whether light behaves as indivisible
quanta in some measurement contexts. 

5 - Sagnac Effect Variations with Matter Density

Masse proposes aether flows into matter, we can conduct Sagnac
interferometer experiments with varying mass distributions around the
optical path. If aether is dragged or flows preferentially toward
matter, the fringe shifts should correlate with local mass
configuration beyond standard relativistic predictions.

6 - Casimir Force Measurements with Directional Asymmetry

If aether has directional flow properties, Casimir force measurements
between parallel plates might show orientation-dependent
variations. Rotate the experimental apparatus relative to Earth's
motion through space or local mass distributions to detect
anisotropies.

7 - Neutron Interferometry with Matter Interaction

We can use neutron interferometry to test whether matter waves show
aether-related effects. If aether flows into matter, neutron paths
passing through or near dense materials might show phase shifts
inconsistent with standard quantum mechanics.
