# Obama's Running Mate

My prediction is that the Obama's running mate will be Bill
Richardson, the hispanic governor of New Mexico, not Hillary
Clinton. This makes sense in many fronts: Obama has problems with
hispanic vote which Bush II courted with great efficiency (probably
due exact mirror opposite of the same issue, black vote was problem
for him). Why the schism between black and hispanic vote? For some
reason these minorities view eachother as rivals, blacks used to be
the largest minority in US until hispanics surpassed them in terms of
numbers a few years back. Hispanics are largely Catholic, blacks are
not. Who knows? In any case, the nations only governor as a running
mate could help Obama to smooth over such divisions. Hillary will be a
baggage.
