Center Point was a little place of fewer than two hundred people. The
black notebook said the man to see was Bo Reece, a longtime supporter
who lived in the best house in town. In the days before television
ads, there was a Bo Reece in most little Arkansas towns. A couple of
weeks before the election, people would ask, “Who’s Bo for?” His
choice would be made known and would get about two-thirds of the vote,
sometimes more.
