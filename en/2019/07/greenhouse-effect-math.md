# The Math for Greenhouse Effect and Global Warming

I like how the video covers how the science was developed and the
steps its inventors took, their thoughts to get there.

Note: Water vapor is effectively a greenhouse gas, and itself a
product of greenhouse effect. So you get into a doom-loop, warmer air
can hold more vapor which in turn acts as a greenhouse gas, helping
air trap more heat. A similar loop
[exists](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01313-4) for
carbon which is trapped in permafrost, as it melts, it accelerates
carbon release.
