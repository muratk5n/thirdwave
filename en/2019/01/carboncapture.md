# Carbon Capture

Finkel, Australia's Chief Scientist

I learnt from researchers that CCS for hydrogen production is
significantly more cost-effective for two crucial reasons. First,
since carbon dioxide is left behind as a residual part of the hydrogen
production process, there is no additional step, and little added
cost, for its extraction. And second, because the gas mixture at the
output of the process is at much higher pressure than flue gases, the
extraction of the carbon dioxide is more energy efficient and it is
easier to store... [T]he United Nations IPCC special report last year
.. spoke of the importance of CCS for mitigating emissions
