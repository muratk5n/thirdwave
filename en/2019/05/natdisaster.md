### Fires

Data comes from [FIRMS](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/active_fire/),
Fire Information for Resource Management System,  I read their MODIS
CSV dataset for the world, for all fires within last 7 days and filter
out fires below a certain brightness threshold. MODIS works through
satellite images, it scans for certain brighness, color on all Earth
images.
