Newt

Everytime I want to write something nice about Newt, moth....ka does
something stupid. That has been the pattern for a while now so I gave
up on this guy. It's too bad really, he is Alvin Toffler's politically
most visible student, and Toffler certainly deserves a better
pupil. Newt has been bitchslapped by the futurist himself many times
(for his weird side views), but I guess the punishment did not
take. Noone knows of course if Newt could change his tune if he became
President (good Newt, or bad Newt?), but if his campaigning is any
sign the weirdness can cloud the good stuff.

Palestenians are made up people? C'mon man!
