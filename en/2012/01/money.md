# Money

Somewhat different from Graeber's explanation, but worth checking
out. The crucial point is money = debt, banks create money out of
nothing to give out as debt, when debt is paid, money is destroyed. If
noone was in debt, there would be no money.

"Then how is interest paid to depositors?" you ask: That money has to
come from somewhere too, and in the current system, it cannot come
anywhere else but from more debt (which is money) to / from someone
else. Since this equation is unbalanced, overall debt must grow in
order to pay back interest + satisfy regular loan demand.

The video answers basic questions such as how is money inserted in the
circulation, and who decides how money there is out there, and how
much. I guess if money in circulation needs any anchor, loans to
people / companies could be that anchor. If someone is in debt, that
person is on the hook, chances are they will be motivated to create
more value in order to pay back the debt. The whole thing of course
does sound like a ponzy scheme which, acording to a cynical view,
could easily be labeled as such.

But increasing debt also means continous growth and that puts pressure
on our energy, and non-renewable resources. A potential solution is
the abolishment of the current system with a self-sustaining
one. Banks lend out of a constant money supply, earn interest but
distribute their earnings back to every citizen. Hence banking becomes
a public service.
