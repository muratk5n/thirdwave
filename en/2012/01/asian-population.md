# Asian Population

We calculated in next 60 years 2 billion people in the world will sadly lose their lives. Since Asia is a continent with a high population density, it is likely that most of the projected death count will come from this continent. Densest countries are the most vulnerable, i.e. in terms of population India has three times more people than US living on a third of her landmass. China is a bit luckier, but overall Asia might witness some hard times.
