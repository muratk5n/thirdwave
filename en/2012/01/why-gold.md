# Why Gold?

It is suggested in [1] that gold as a currency was part of a
military-slave-minting complex. If one had to continue this pattern,
one could conclude in order for a metal to be currency, its rarity is
not enough. What is truly necessary is that this metal be hard to mine
and rare because only a military complex that can wage wars, get
slaves who can be employed for the mining task can get that
hard-to-dig material. This must be why military rulers preferred gold
for centuries, IOW if say there was a metal on Earth called fartium
just as rare as gold but easy to find, it could not become
currency. No ruler would make it currency, because this metal could be
found by anyone and inserted in the circulation -- by people other
than soldiers who a military wants to support logistically.

Some economists argue we need gold standard, or on some standard based
on any rare metal -- but what Graeber suggests in the above link is
that the rarity of the metal is not the issue. Plus nowadays there are
many companies, individuals who can mine this stuff without owning
slaves, one of the "advantages" of gold as a currency disappears.

No, a third wave solution must be non-concentrated, non-centralized;
individuals should be able to create this stuff. A fork of an
existinng, fast, efficient digital currency with self-printing
capability (periodically new money is created in everyone's account)
could do the job.
