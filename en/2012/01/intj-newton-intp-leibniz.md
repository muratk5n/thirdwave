# INTJ Newton INTP Leibniz

Link

As you probably learned in school, Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz (INTP) developed the mathematical instrument of calculus simultaneously. But where Leibnitz was interested in precision and in isolating and proving the principles of calculus for the sake of the principle itself (Ti), Newton’s system of calculus was messy and oriented towards utility – the solving concrete problems at hand (Te) – rather than towards principle itself. One could almost say that once Newton was convinced that his principles were true, he wouldn’t bother proving it true to others [..] As a young student, [Newton] began the study of geometry … he read the theorems, saw that they were true, and omitted the proofs. He wondered why anybody should take pains to prove things so evident.

Every approach has its place of course; We shared in previous post y' that Leibniz's Calculus notation was more expressive and made certain additional research possible.

BTW, Te is also about if-then-else style thinking, such as going from point A to point B, contingency planning, measurement. Te is *very* adamant on measurement. Newton working as warden of the mint makes sense from this POV. If-then-else thinking is very suitable for computer programming, just as a side note.

Newton had lots of fights with fellow scientists, that also fits the pattern, at least statistically; there is no Fe anywhere on his "top four" that'd help creating harmony. We dont mean to say an INTJ automatically means an hard-ass, but introvert Rationals who are, in general, seem to be coming from this group.
