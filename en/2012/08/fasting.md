# Fasting

It could be said (some) religions try to replicate the hunger-feasting
cycle by their fasting process. Jewish tradition has it, Budhists have
it, and so does Islam. In Islam there is the 30 day fasting period,
but then I see these Muslims sometimes who wake up pre-dawn and stuff
themselves with food, so that the hunger period that follows is
"easier on them". When you read the literature (and history) on this
subject, that does not seem to be part of the religion. Even if you
wake up pre-dawn, the eating is supposed to be light, and that fits
with the hunter-gatherer mode of living. It is interesting how ppl can
exploit loopholes for their own ease of living and claim it is the
tradition, turning something potentially healthy into a dieting
nightmare.
