# Post office nears historic default on $5B payment

The U.S. Postal Service is bracing for a first-ever default on
billions in payments due to the Treasury, adding to widening
uncertainty about the mail agency's solvency as first-class letters
plummet and Congress deadlocks on ways to stem the red ink.

With cash running perilously low, two legally required payments for
future postal retirees' health benefits - $5.5 billion due Wednesday,
and another $5.6 billion due in September - will be left unpaid, the
mail agency said Monday. Postal officials said they also are studying
whether they may need to delay other obligations. In the coming
months, a $1.5 billion payment is due to the Labor Department for
workers compensation, which for now it expects to make, as well as
millions in interest payments to the Treasury.
