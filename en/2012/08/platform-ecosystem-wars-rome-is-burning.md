# Platform Ecosystem Wars: Rome Is Burning

It is either a good week to be having a CrunchUp
 focusing on the faltering Facebook ecosystem or it is a terrible week. 
Either way it is a compelling and interesting week, and whether it is 
good or bad depends on who you are and what your role is in the 
ecosystem.

Following the departure of Ethan Beard (director of platform 
partnerships); Katie Mitic (platform marketing director) and Jonathan 
Matus (mobile platform marketing manager) this week; and the revelations
 from an embittered and chastened Dalton Caldwell, it seems to me that 
the tide is turning against Facebook as a reliable partner for 
developers to depend upon.
