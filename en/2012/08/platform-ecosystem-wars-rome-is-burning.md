# Platform Ecosystem Wars: Rome Is Burning

It is either a good week to be having a CrunchUp focusing on the
faltering Facebook ecosystem or it is a terrible week.  Either way it
is a compelling and interesting week, and whether it is good or bad
depends on who you are and what your role is in the ecosystem.

Following the departure of Ethan Beard (director of platform
partnerships); Katie Mitic (platform marketing director) and Jonathan
Matus (mobile platform marketing manager) this week; and the
revelations from an embittered and chastened Dalton Caldwell, it seems
to me that the tide is turning against Facebook as a reliable partner
for developers to depend upon.
