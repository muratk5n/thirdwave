# Habitualizing Skills

An M.I.T. neuroscientist named Ann Graybiel told me that she and her colleagues began exploring habits [..] While each animal wandered through the maze, 
its brain was working furiously. Every time a rat sniffed the air or 
scratched a wall, the neurosensors inside the animal’s head exploded 
with activity. As the scientists repeated the experiment, again and 
again, the rats eventually stopped sniffing corners and making wrong 
turns and began to zip through the maze with more and more speed. And 
within their brains, something unexpected occurred: as each rat learned 
how to complete the maze more quickly, its mental activity decreased. As the path became more and more automatic — as it became a habit — the rats started thinking less and less.


This process, in which the brain converts a sequence of actions into an 
automatic routine, is called “chunking.” There are dozens, if not 
hundreds, of behavioral chunks we rely on every day. Some are simple: 
you automatically put toothpaste on your toothbrush before sticking it 
in your mouth. Some, like making the kids’ lunch, are a little more 
complex. Still others are so complicated that it’s remarkable to realize
 that a habit could have emerged at all.
