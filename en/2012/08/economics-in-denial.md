# Economics In Denial

In an exasperated outburst, just before he left the
presidency of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet
complained that, “as a policymaker during the crisis, I found the
available [economic and financial] models of limited help. In
fact, I would go further: in the face of the crisis, we felt
abandoned by conventional tools.”


Trichet went on to appeal for inspiration from other disciplines
– physics, engineering, psychology, and biology – to help explain
the phenomena he had experienced. It was a remarkable cry for
help, and a serious indictment of the economics profession, not
to mention all those extravagantly rewarded finance professors in
business schools from Harvard to Hyderabad [..]


These are fertile fields for future study, but what of the core
disciplines of economics and finance themselves? Can nothing be
done to make them more useful in explaining the world as it is,
rather than as it is assumed to be in their stylized models? [..] The Nobel laureate economist Robert Lucas has argued that the
crisis was not predicted because economic theory predicts that
such events cannot be predicted.

So all is well.
