# About to Pop

This is absolutely right as far as it 
goes, and Joe is to be applauded for this post, but the problems with 
scientific publication run even deeper.

Summary

Higher ed is about to go bankrupt
Most academic research outside of a few top universities is never cited, non-reproducible, and should never have been funded
Citation analysis shows only a tiny group of scientists actually moves any given field forward
Science will increasingly go back to the future, becoming gentleman science
The angel investor is the new professor, and the entrepreneur is the new grad student
One model: make a few million in the startup sector and then do science unencumbered for the rest of your life
Another model: find a wealthy patron willing to fund you via vehicles
 like Thiel Fellowships (just like Soros or Hughes Fellowships)
A third model: bring down the costs of doing research with things like 
openpcr.com and hack on stuff in your garage after your day job
The new model for pure research is github, citizen science, open source, and reproducible research, not universities


Bugs and patches, not retractions

Take a look at the issue list for a popular open source data visualization tool named d3
 on github. It is accepted that even a shipping piece of production code
 will have many serious bugs. There is a process of constant improvement
 for things as mission critical as the Linux Kernel.
 While this should go without saying for the computer scientists in the 
audience, Linux sure does require in depth knowledge of algorithms, and it is by no means just bookkeeping/theoretically uninteresting code.

Contrast
 this situation to academia. While many give lip service to the concept 
of science as a continually correcting enterprise, in practice a 
correction (let alone a retraction) can be career damaging or career 
ending, especially for those pre-tenure. With the death penalty for 
failure, academics have every incentive to stonewall requests for 
materials, data, or source code. This is not limited to the biological 
sciences (e.g. “Even
 if WMO agrees, I will still not pass on the data. We have 25 or so 
years invested in the work. Why should I make the data available to you,
 when your aim is to try and find something wrong with it.” ).

The
 solution: adopt the culture of open source, where source is assumed to 
be fragile and bug reports are met with patches. Reject the culture of 
academia, where “peer reviewed” papers are assumed to be correct, while 
corrections and retractions carry a career penalty.

Academia is funded by a tuition bubble that is about to pop

Academics rightly bemoan Elsevier’s extortionary journal costs. What they don’t realize, however, is that Elsevier is a billion dollar remora feeding off the trillion dollar academic bubble. Publishing will be reinvented as soon as academia goes bust. With the advent
 of Coursera, Udacity, and Khan Academy, which offer elite higher ed 
content online (plus certification) for free, that will happen within 
the next ten years, probably within the next five.

Because there 
is just no way anyone will pay $250,000 and four years of their life in a
 down economy when they can get the same education and now a job by 
doing these online certifications in machine learning. The decline will 
be as rapid and irreversible as the fall of print media.
 The people reading GNZ tend to be ahead of the curve and will get more 
involved with non-traditional funding sources early. But others in 
academe will likely be in denial till the ship hits the iceberg.

Solution:
 replace the unsustainable cross-subsidy which uses undergraduate 
tuition to fund research with new business models. Put basic 
certification online via vehicles like Coursera, and encourage the 
smartest in society via institutions like YCombinator to actually ship 
products that work, rather than non-reproducible papers.

Most papers are not reproducible

Most academic papers are flatly non-reproducible. See here and here.
 Many Nature and Science papers are highly conditional studies on cell 
lines that don’t replicate outside of the publishing laboratory (to be 
charitable) or do not replicate at all. When you try to commercialize a 
study, that’s when you find out how much stuff doesn’t really work:

This problem is accepted to the point that the most successful venture 
capitalists have learned to reproduce results by independent observers 
before they commit to early-stage funding.
Outside of orthopedics, 
the pharmaceutical company Bayer recently reported an example of this 
problem. In September 2011, Bayer published an evaluation of 67 
published studies in which they failed to duplicate two-thirds of the 
results with their in-house experiments.
As an aside,
 this observation is interesting as it neatly inverts the standard 
academic presumption that good/pure science is done within academia and 
bad/conflicted science is done in industry. In point of fact, to ship a 
product the science must be absolutely unimpeachable (or else it is 
obvious that the product is nonfunctional), whereas to ship a paper one 
must only pass the filters of 2-3 people and avoid the limelight. Just 
look at most of the papers in JBC or any mass-production journal for 
examples of the latter approach.

Solution: reject any in-depth 
study that cannot be regenerated via `make` or the equivalent from 
source code, templates, and data hosted on a public server. Encourage 
the automation and thus the reproducibility of basic laboratory 
processes, and if infeasible to automate, provide video documentation of
 experimental protocols at the standard of jove.com using inexpensive 
video-editing software.

Conclusion

Academia is rapidly 
headed for a reckoning. Scientific publication will be “solved” as a 
consequence, with the future looking like reproducible research hosted 
on github and cooperatives like biocurious.org. Most work will be done 
open-source, by citizen scientists, with larger projects funded by 
independently wealthy technologists and/or investors who see the 
possibility of turning a pure research finding into a scaleable product.
