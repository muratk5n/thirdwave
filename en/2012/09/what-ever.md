# What-ever

There is a quote attributed to the futurist Alvin Toffler that captures 
this new reality: In the future “illiteracy will not be defined by those
 who cannot read and write, but by those who cannot learn and relearn.” [..] You have to work harder and smarter and develop new skills faster.

He doesnt exactly mean work hard to learn, relearn you buffoon.

In Future Shock he also talks about the limits of how much change the human brain can handle. So it's about learning comfortably unlearn comfortably relearn comfortably. And here's the kicker: if the system  does not let us do these comfortably, then it is the system that will collapse, not the people in it. There is so much even the always-be-closing, wired-but-not-tired, yeah-yeah-yeah, get-rich-or-die-tryin Americans  can handle. 

I think you journalists are genetically ill-equipped to understand these concepts. You know - Toffler also went to Turkey and was  greeted by another buffoon there. Sadly after "reading" his books,  meeting the man, the only thing this buffoon seems to have understood from the entire experience is "there is change".

Change but WHAT KIND? The man wrote hundreds of pages to explain you what that is, and most importanly what it isn't. But it somehow fails to register with ppl who are attracted only to shiny objects. 

Anyway; I found out about the comical "New Rules" link from here. I'll let him do the rest of the bitchslapping from here on. 

Also see here about working hard.
