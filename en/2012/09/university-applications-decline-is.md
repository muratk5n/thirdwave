# University applications decline is a 'storm warning'

It emerged that the total number of people applying to English
universities has fallen from 421,448 to 384,170 – a drop of almost
nine per cent.

The Independent Commission on Fees – set up to track the effects of
the new funding regime – warned that students were most likely to be
put off in England, where fees are higher than elsewhere in the UK.

It insisted that declines in application rates to the most
sought-after universities were higher among students from middle and
upper-class backgrounds who are less likely to benefit from a generous
system of grants and bursaries.

In a damning conclusion, researchers insisted there was “initial
evidence that higher tuition fees are having a measurable impact” on
student choices.
