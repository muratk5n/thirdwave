# Your Online Ivy: Coursera

For decades, the door to America’s top-tier universities has
beenclosing, and today your chances of being admitted to
theseprestigious institutions is slimmer than ever. This year,
theacceptance rate at four of the eight Ivy League Schools hitrecord
lows. Stanford professors Daphne Koller and Andrew Nglaunched Coursera
earlier this year to fling that door wide open.They created a platform
that provides the framework and hostingservices for massively open
online courses, or MOOCs, to bring,via the Web, an elite education to
the public for free. Atlaunch, when there were only three institutions
on board, italmost seemed crazy. But universities see Coursera as
anopportunity to experiment online learning and alternativeteaching
techniques. In the beginning, the Coursera team had togo out and
actively seek partnerships with America’s eliteinstitutions.
