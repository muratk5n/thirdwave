# Stretched Thin

Link

To stretch this far … modernity must necessarily be culturally thin. … It is a generic culture, this culture of the television age, of asphalt, advertising, uniformity, and waste. And those who feed on it, those who live by it, become generic people who also are thin, who stretch wide and belong to nowhere in particular.
