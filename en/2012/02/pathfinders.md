# Pathfinders

Here is a great book on Islam and science. I perused through it, and
boom: found a passage that talks about how Greeks were busy with
science but Byzantium Empire wasnt. Frankly I am quite tired of being
right on this issue: Romans, Byzantium and Ottomans represent a dark
chapter in human history whose ill-effects persist even today.
