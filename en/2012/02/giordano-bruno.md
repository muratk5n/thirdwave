# Giordano Bruno

Giordano Bruno (1548 â€“ 1600), was a philosopher, mathematician and
astronomer. His cosmological theories went beyond the Copernican model
in proposing that the Sun was essentially a star, and moreover, that
the universe contained an infinite number of inhabited worlds
populated by other intelligent beings. He was burned at the stake by
civil authorities in 1600 after the Roman Inquisition.Bruno was deeply
influenced by the astronomical facts of the universe inherited from
Arab astrology, Neoplatonism and Renaissance Hermeticism. He is said
to have made a threatening gesture towards his judges and to have
replied: "Maiori forsan cum timore sententiam in me fertis quam ego
accipiam meaning "perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with
greater fear than I receive it."
