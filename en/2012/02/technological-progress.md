# Technological Progress

I am still stuck on this issue: Peter Thiel and some dismal scientist (ahem, economist) push this POV, that tech progress has stopped. The dismal scientist says for example [paraphrasing] "there has not been big inventions such as radio, television in recent years". Well, sure these were all big inventions, but my point is that nowadays there are so many avenues where inventions take place, in many different ways that most of it goes unnoticed. Take the average Internet router. Its electronic brain executes countless algorithms, whose speed and sophistication increased exponentially since its invention. Moore's Law by itself is proof that invention rushes full steam ahead. Every few years CPU speed doubles, and I argue every decade, a new microprocessor architecture is invented.

Yes, once upon a time we had NO microprocessor, and then we had some microprocessors, any dumbass can detect this change. But we keep reinventing the microprocessor architecture which goes by unnoticed. Another example: once there were NO cars, now many ppl have one. Fine.

But now Google has self-driving cars foo! How is that not progress? Is this advancement not on par with radio? Even a bitch-ass dismal scientist can see that!
