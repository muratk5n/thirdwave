# The Structural Revolution

[We] believe the core problems are structural, not cyclical. The recession 
grew out of and exposed long-term flaws in the economy. Fixing these 
structural problems should be the order of the day, not papering over 
them with more debt.


There are several overlapping structural problems. First, there are 
those surrounding [..] technological change. Hyperefficient [..] companies need fewer workers. As a result, unemployment 
rises, superstar salaries surge while lower-skilled wages stagnate, the 
middle gets hollowed out and inequality grows.        

Then there are the structural issues surrounding the decline in human 
capital. The United States, once the world’s educational leader, is 
falling back in the pack. Unemployment is high, but companies still have
 trouble finding skilled workers.


Then there is political sclerosis. Over the decades, companies and other
 entities have implanted a growing number of special-interest deals into
 the tax and regulatory codes, making it harder for politically 
unconnected, new competitors, making the economy less dynamic.        

These and other structural problems have retarded growth and wages for 
decades. Consumers tried to compensate by borrowing more. Politicians 
tried to compensate by reducing the tax bill, increasing deficit 
spending, ensuring easy credit for homebuyers and by helping workers 
shift out of the hypercompetitive, globalized part of the economy and 
into the less productive and more sheltered parts of the economy — 
mostly into health care, government and education. 



But you can only mask structural problems for so long. The whole thing 
has gone kablooey. The current model, in which we try to compensate for 
structural economic weakness with tax cuts and an unsustainable welfare 
state, simply cannot last. The old model is broken. The jig is up. 



Unlike the cyclicalists, we structuralists do not believe that the level
 of government spending is the main factor in determining how fast an 
economy grows. If that were true, then Greece, Britain and France would 
have the best economies on earth [..].



Running up huge deficits without fixing the underlying structure will 
not restore growth. As Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago writes in the current issue of Foreign Affairs,
 “Since the growth before the crisis was distorted in fundamental ways, 
it is hard to imagine that governments could restore demand quickly — or
 that doing so would be enough to get the global economy back on track. 
The status quo ante is not a good place to return to because bloated 
finance, residential construction and government sectors need to shrink,
 and workers need to move to more productive work.” 



Structuralists face a tension: How much should you reduce the pain the 
unemployed are feeling now, and how much should you devote your 
resources to long-term reform? There has to be balance. For my taste, 
the Germans are a bit too willing to impose short-term pain on the 
diverse national economies in Europe. But they are absolutely right to 
insist on the sort of structural reforms they themselves passed in the 
1990s. 



In the United States, there are almost no politicians willing to embrace
 the cyclicalist agenda, which would mean much larger deficits. 
Structuralists don’t have a perfect champion either. President Obama is 
too minimalist. He doesn’t seem to believe America’s structural problems
 are that big, making his reform ideas small.
