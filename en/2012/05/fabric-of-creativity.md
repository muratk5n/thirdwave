# The Fabric of Creativity

When Fast Company set out to find the most innovative company in
America, we wanted to rely on objective measurements, but that proved
daunting. How can you quantify something as intangible as innovation?
You can count up patents and discover that IBM is the leader, with a
record 3,415 awarded in 2003. But patents have come to mean a lot less
than they used to. The most creative companies of the Internet era --
Amazon, Google, Yahoo, eBay -- have only a few patents apiece. You can
look at who spends the most on R&D, but a torrent of cash hardly
guarantees breakthrough innovation. Over the past decade, Microsoft
has poured $5 billion or more a year into research, but its vast
expenditures still haven't yielded the next big thing [..]

So we gave up on crunching numbers and focused on other criteria. For
 starters, we looked for a company with a long history of
 innovation. We needed proof of sustained inventiveness through
 multiple waves of technological and economic change. That knocked out
 Amazon, Google, and the other Silicon Valley startups. We also wanted
 a company that is as adept at product innovation as it is at process
 innovation. That eliminated Dell, which is highly innovative at
 making its operations incredibly efficient -- but not at bringing
 original and inspiring offerings to consumers. Apple, on the other
 hand, keeps coming out with dazzling new technologies, but count it
 out for process: The company relies too much on the inscrutable
 instincts of one man. What if Steve Jobs wasn't there anymore? It's a
 possibility that investors contemplated recently when Jobs underwent
 emergency surgery for pancreatic cancer. We wanted a company where
 innovation is resilient and doesn't depend on the ingenuity of a
 single individual or even a small cadre of geniuses. That led us to a
 few big operations that have hatched countless new products over the
 decades -- justly famous names such as 3M and General Electric.

But then we found an outfit that does it all, without the overwhelming
size and awesome resources of a GE. In other words, a company that
proves that brains beat brawn. Pound for pound, the most innovative
company in America is W.L. Gore & Associates [..].

Gore, a privately owned company, doesn't release its annual financial
data, but a spokesperson says that the company has had "double digit"
revenue growth for the past couple of years. In many businesses, Gore
has come out of nowhere and seized the market lead [..] When Gore's
people think they can create a much better product, they're fearless
about attacking new markets.

Gore is a strikingly contradictory company: a place where nerds can be
mavericks; a place that's impatient with the standard way of working,
but more than patient with nurturing ideas and giving them time to
flourish; a place that's humble in its origins, yet ravenous for
breakthrough ideas and, ultimately, growth. Gore's uniqueness comes
from being as innovative in its operating principles as it is in its
diverse product lines. This is a company that has kicked over the
rules that most other organizations live by. It is tucked away in the
mid-Atlantic countryside, 3,000 miles from Silicon Valley and even
further (in its mind-set) from Wall Street. And in its quietly
revolutionary way, it is doing something almost magical: fostering
ongoing, consistent, breakthrough creativity.

What really distinguishes Gore is its culture, which goes back to
1958, when Wilbert ("Bill") L. Gore left DuPont, where he had worked
as an engineer for 17 years, and launched his startup. Bill liked to
say that "communication really happens in the car pool." At a
hierarchical company, the car pool is the only place where people talk
to one another freely without regard for the chain of command. He also
observed that when there's a crisis, a company creates a task force
and throws out the rules. That's when organizations take risks and
make big breakthroughs.  Why, he wondered, should you have to wait for
a crisis?

So Bill Gore threw out the rules. He created a place with hardly any
hierarchy and few ranks and titles. He insisted on direct, one-on-one
communication; anyone in the company could speak to anyone else. In
essence, he organized the company as though it were a bunch of small
task forces. To promote this idea, he limited the size of teams --
keeping even the manufacturing facilities to 150 to 200 people at
most.  That's small enough so that people can get to know one another
and what everyone is working on, and who has the skills and knowledge
they might tap to get something accomplished -- whether it's creating
an innovative product or handling the everyday challenges of running a
business [..].

Consider the case of Diane Davidson, whom the company hired to work on
Citywear, an effort that has persuaded designers such as Prada, Hugo
Boss, and Polo to use Gore-Tex fabrics in clothing that people can
wear to the office or out to a party. Nothing in Davidson's 15 years
of experience as a sales executive in the apparel industry, including
a stint at Bostonian, prepared her for life in a place where there are
no bosses and no clear-cut roles.

"I came from a very traditional male-dominated business -- the men's
shoe business," she recalls. "When I arrived at Gore, I didn't know
who did what. I wondered how anything got done here. It was driving me
crazy." Like all new hires, Davidson was given a "starting sponsor" at
Gore -- a mentor, not a boss. But she didn't know how to work without
someone telling her what to do.

"Who's my boss?" she kept asking.

"Stop using the B-word," her sponsor replied.

As an experienced executive, Davidson assumed that Gore's talk was typical corporate euphemism rather than real practice.

"Secretly, there are bosses, right?" she asked.

There weren't. She eventually figured out that "your team is your 
boss, because you don't want to let them down. Everyone's your boss, and
 no one's your boss."

What's more, Davidson saw that people didn't fit into standard job 
descriptions. They had all made different sets of "commitments" to their
 team, often combining roles that remained segregated in different 
fiefdoms at conventional companies, such as sales, marketing, and 
product design. It took a long time to get to know people and what they 
did -- and for them to get to know her and trust her with 
responsibilities. Eventually, Davidson went on to oversee the sales 
force and product development for Citywear. She describes herself as a 
"category champion." She's involved in marketing, sales, and sponsorship
 -- a good example of how Gore's associates create roles that aren't 
easily defined by traditional corporate departments.

Gore's knack for innovation doesn't come from throwing money or 
bodies at a challenge, or from building a great ivory tower of an 
R&D lab. It springs from a culture where people feel free to pursue 
ideas on their own, communicate with one another, and collaborate out of
 self-motivation rather than a sense of duty. Gore enshrines the idea of
 "natural leadership." Leaders aren't designated from on high. People 
become leaders by actually leading, and if you want to be a leader 
there, you have to recruit followers. Since there's no chain of command,
 no one has to follow. In a sense, you become a talent magnet: You 
attract other talented people who want to work with you. You draw them 
with your passion for what you're working on and the credibility that 
you've built over time.

"Natural leadership" is how Gore, which had no experience whatsoever 
in the music business, wound up inventing Elixir, the top-selling 
acoustic guitar string and a big advance in a field that had gone three 
decades without a technological breakthrough. Elixir came out of an 
unlikely place: one of Gore's medical-product plants in Flagstaff, 
Arizona. Dave Myers was an engineer there who helped invent new kinds of
 plastic heart implants. Gore encourages its associates to spend some of
 their time -- typically around 10% -- on speculative new ideas. As a 
side project, Myers was working on his mountain bike, trying to make the
 gears shift more smoothly. He coated the gear cables with a thin layer 
of plastic, much like Gore-Tex. His tinkering resulted in Gore's Ride-On
 line of bike cables. That success inspired Myers to try to improve the 
cables used for controlling the movements of oversized animated puppets 
at places such as Disney World and Chuck E. Cheese's. He needed cables 
that had small diameters, so he tried taking guitar strings and coating 
them with a similar plastic. His eureka moment came in 1993, when he 
asked himself: "Gosh, would this make a good guitar string?" He had an 
instinct that the coating would make guitar strings feel less brittle.

Myers wasn't a guitarist himself, so he sought out help from a 
colleague who was: Chuck Hebestreit, an engineer who knew firsthand the 
frustrations that musicians had with the instrument. The natural oils on
 their fingers, which carry particles of dust and skin, contaminate the 
strings when they get into the minuscule nooks between the tightly wound
 wire coils. The accumulation of this tiny debris dampens the sound of 
the vibrating string and makes it maddeningly unpredictable. And metal 
corrodes over time, just from exposure to the air. So the strings had 
short, unpredictable lives.

The pair experimented for two years without success. Then another 
colleague at the Flagstaff plant, John Spencer, heard about their 
project. Spencer had recently finished working on Gore's launch of 
Glide, which two years ago racked up $45 million in sales. He sensed 
there was a chance to create as big an advance in guitar strings as they
 had made in dental floss. He joined the guitar effort, contributing in 
his spare time even as he worked on his main "commitment," [..]

Gore puts its R&D technologists and its salespeople in the same 
building as its production workers, so the entire team can work together
 and roles can blend. The trio in Flagstaff persuaded a half-dozen 
colleagues to help with improving the strings. They all did it in their 
spare time. Finally, after three years of working entirely out of their 
own motivation -- three years without asking for anyone's permission or 
being subjected to any kind of oversight -- the team sought out the 
official support of the larger company, which they needed to actually 
take the product to market [..].

Gore's humanistic culture is the legacy of Bill Gore, who died in 
1986. If you were asked to list the great visionaries of American 
business in the 20th century, other names would be more famous, but 
Wilbert L. Gore surely deserves to be on the roster. He's the closest 
thing to an East Coast version of David Packard and William Hewlett, 
both for his company's far-ranging engineering acumen and its reputation
 as an uncommonly benign place to work [..].

The Gore organization isn't as fanatically flat as some idealized 
accounts have made it out to be. There is indeed a president and CEO, 
Chuck Carroll, a quiet man who succeeded Bob four years ago. And the 
company necessarily has some structure. The four divisions (fabrics, 
medical, industrial, and electronic products) each have a recognized 
"leader," as do certain companywide support functions (human resources, 
information technology) and specific businesses and cells. But there is 
no codified set of ranks and positions as there is in the typical 
corporation. As a Gore "associate," you're supposed to morph your role 
over time to match your skills. You're not expected to fit into some 
preconceived box or standardized organizational niche [..].

Gore encourages risk taking. When Gore people pull the plug on a failing
 initiative, they'll still have a "celebration" with beer or champagne, 
just as they would if it had been a success.

"We were a lot more radical compared to the norm in 1958," says 
Brad Jones, who leads the industrial-products division. "The gap between
 Gore and other companies has narrowed. But we're still different. 
Companies may have fewer layers today, but they still have pyramids and 
reporting structures. You can still feel the difference in an 
organization when the only person speaking in a meeting is the top 
person. It's easier to compare us to a startup company."

From Organization Theory and Design by Daft

Bursting with resolve, Jack Dougherty, a newly minted M.B.A. from the College of William and Mary, reported to his first day at Gore Assoc. (GA) on July 26, 1976. He presented himself to Bill Gore, shook hands firmly, looked him in the eye, and said he was ready for anything.

Jack was not ready, however, for what happened next. Gore replied, “That’s fine, Jack, fine. Why don’t you look around and find something you’d like to do?” Three frustrating weeks later he found that something: trading in his dark blue suit for jeans, he loaded fabric into the mouth of a machine that laminated the company’s patented GORE- TEX ®1 membrane to fabric. By 1982, Jack had become responsible for all advertising and marketing in the fabrics group. This story is part of the folklore of W. L. Gore & Associates. [..]

GA has never had titles, hierarchy, or any of the conventional structures associated with enterprises of its size. The titles of president and secretary-treasurer continue to be used only because they are required by the laws of incorporation. In addition, Gore has never had a corporate-wide mission or code of ethics statement, nor has Gore ever required or prohibited business units from developing such statements for themselves. Thus, the Associates of some business units who have felt a need for such statements have developed them on their own. When questioned about this issue, one Associate stated, “The company belief is that (1) its four basic operating principles cover ethical practices required of people in business; (2) it will not tolerate illegal practices.” Gore’s management style has been referred to as unmanagement. The organization has been guided by Bill’s experiences on teams at DuPont and has evolved as needed.

For example, in 1965 GA was a thriving company with a facility on Paper Mill Road in Newark, Delaware. One Monday morning in the summer, Bill Gore was taking his usual walk through the plant. All of a sudden he realized that he did not know everyone in the plant. The team had become too big. As a result, he established the practice of limiting plant size to approximately two hundred Associates. Thus was born the expansion policy of “Get big by staying small.” The purpose of maintaining small plants was to accentuate a close-knit atmosphere and encourage communication among Associates in a facility.[..]

GA has been described not only as unmanaged, but also as unstructured. Bill Gore referred to the structure as a lattice organization (Exhibit 3). The characteristics of this structure are:

1. Direct lines of communication—person to person—no intermediary
2. No fixed or assigned authority
3. Sponsors, not bosses
4. Natural leadership defined by followership
5. Objectives set by those who must “make them happen”
6. Tasks and functions organized through commitments

The structure within the lattice is complex and evolves from interpersonal interactions, self commitment to group-known responsibilities, natural leadership, and group- imposed discipline. Bill Gore once explained the structure this way: “Every successful organization has an underground lattice. It’s where the news spreads like lightning, where people can go around the organization to get things done.” An analogy might be drawn to a structure of constant cross-area teams—the equivalent of quality circles going on all the time. When a puzzled interviewer told Bill that he was having trouble understanding how planning and accountability worked, Bill replied with a grin: “So am I. You ask me how it works? Every which way.”

The lattice structure has not been without its critics. As Bill Gore stated, “I’m told from time to time that a lattice organization can’t meet a crisis well because it takes too long to reach a consensus when there are no bosses. But this isn’t true. Actually, a lattice by its very nature works particularly well in a crisis. A lot of useless effort is avoided because there is no rigid management hierarchy to conquer before you can attack a problem.”

The lattice has been put to the test on a number of occasions. For example, in 1975, Dr. Charles Campbell of the University of Pittsburgh reported that a GORE-TEX arterial graft had developed an aneurysm. If the bubble-like protrusion continued to expand, it would explode.

Obviously, this life-threatening situation had to be resolved quickly and permanently. Within only a few days of Dr. Campbell’s first report, he flew to Newark to pres- ent his findings to Bill and Bob Gore and a few other Associates. The meeting lasted two hours. Dan Hubis, a former policeman who had joined Gore to develop new production methods, had an idea before the meeting was over. He returned to his work area to try some different production techniques. After only three hours and twelve tries, he had developed a permanent solution.[..]

As Bill Gore said: “All our lives most of us have been told what to do, and some people don’t know how to respond when asked to do something— and have the very real option of saying no—on their job. It’s the new Associate’s responsibility to find out what he or she can do for the good of the operation.” The vast majority of the new Associates, after some initial floundering, have adapted quickly.[..]

Within GA, the various people who take lead roles are thought of as being leaders, not managers. Bill Gore described in an internal memo the kinds of leadership and the role of leadership as follows:

1. The Associate who is recognized by a team as having a special knowledge, or experience (for example, this could be a chemist, computer expert, machine operator, salesman, engineer, lawyer). This kind of leader gives the team guidance in a special area.

..

10. Entrepreneuring Associates who organize new teams for new businesses, new products, new processes, new devices, new marketing efforts, new or better methods of all kinds. These leaders invite other Associates to “sign up” for their project.

It is clear that leadership is widespread in our lattice organization and that it is continually changing and evolving. The situation that leaders are frequently also sponsors should not imply that these are different activities and responsibilities.

Leaders are not authoritarians, managers of people, or supervisors who tell us what to do or forbid us to do things; nor are they “parents” to whom we transfer our own self-responsibility. However, they do often advise us of the consequences of actions we have done or propose to do. Our actions result in contributions, or lack of contribution, to the success of our enterprise. Our pay depends on the magnitude of our contributions. This is the basic discipline of our lattice organization.

Annually, Gore also buys company stock equivalent to a fixed percent of the Associates’ annual incomes, placing it in the ASOP retirement fund. Thus, an Associate can become a stockholder after being at Gore for a year. Gore’s ASOP ensures Associates participate in the growth of the company by acquiring ownership in it. Bill Gore wanted Associates to feel that they themselves are owners. One Associate stated, “This is much more important than profit sharing.” In fact, some long-term Associates (including a twenty-five-year veteran machinist) have become millionaires from the ASOP.

---

I like how Gore allows people in defining new products, basically acting as a company within a company. This is not a single leader, or the "rockstar" model. This is basically a centerless, distributed, and disconnected model. Anyone can take initiative in any direction they want, and they need to recruit people for these goals internally just like companies recruit people externally. I especially like how failures are celebrated just as successes.
