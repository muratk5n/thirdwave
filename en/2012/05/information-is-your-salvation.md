# Information Is Your Salvation

Greece, as you may recall, was facing bankruptcy this spring [.. and] getting roughly 100,000 bondholders scattered around the globe [..] to sign off on the deal on a 
tight deadline was going to be a logistical nightmare.

[Bondholder Communication Group manager] Bob Apfel  says, "so I bought 100 iPads." 

The Apple (AAPL) tablets, equipped with a custom-made
 debt-restructuring app, were handed out to the leadership team,
 including representatives from the Finance Ministry, the Hellenic
 Exchange (the Greek equivalent of the NYSE), the Bank of Greece
 (their version of the Federal Reserve) and the three external banks
 that managed the deal, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Lazard.  The idea was
 to give the participants a rich set of analytic tools and real-time,
 secure connections to both the global clearing systems and the back
 offices of banks around the world.

"During the lead-up to the launch," says Apfel, "members of the 
financial leadership team were spending over half their time on the 
road, meeting with investors or financial overseers from the EU and 
other parts of the troika. There was a palpable need to create a 
financial decision-makers' platform that could follow the financier – 
not vice versa."

Toward the end, things got pretty exciting.

"I watched hundreds of millions of bonds being 'slam dunked' as these
 guys were running down the halls," says Apfel. "Split-second decisions 
were made that couldn't have been made without the data platform."

When last deal finally closed on April 25, $270 billion of Greek debt had been reduced to $130 billion.
