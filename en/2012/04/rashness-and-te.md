# Rashness and Te

In this post, we said extroversion does not have much to do with being
rash. Surely in terms of response time to external stimuli, especially
in social situations E's can seem quicker, and in the negative perhaps
rash. But in terms of decision making, measuring the quickness (and
the shallow conclusions that might result) that is implied with that
word is mostly associated with Te -- extroverted thinking. But .. even
introverts can be Te users. This highlights the importance of
understanding the functions of MBTI instead of simply isolated letters
by themselves.
