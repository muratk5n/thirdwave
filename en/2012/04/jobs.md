# Jobs

Jobs is marked as ISTP by CelebrityTypes.com. Some quotes are shared
here. Jobs does not give much credit to thinking, a typical STP
trait. He was for utility, and NTs, SJs are utilitarian as well, but
it appears he was much more focused on impact, and living in the now
the way an Artisan would be. He is adverserial -- in a way an INTJ
could be as well.. but his seemingly enjoying it as a sport, whereas
an NTJ would have seen it as unneeded annoyance, also can make a case
for his ISTP'ness. In addition for an NT, gathering knowledge is
almost a life quest, and Jobs apparently had no interest in this
regard, at least for pure theoretical / application purposes. He was
about the object, about the now, not about the abstract.
