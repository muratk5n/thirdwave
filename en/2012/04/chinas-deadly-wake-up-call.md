# China's deadly wake-up call

The recent collision of two high-speed trains in China that left at 
least 39 people dead is quickly becoming a symbol for many Chinese of 
all that's wrong with China's government and economy [..] If you want to understand the tensions in the Chinese system of 
government and development that might put a knot in straight-line growth
 projections for China's future, spend a minute studying the way this 
event is rippling across China.

"China the innovator" took a big hit [..] The rejoinder from Japanese and German makers of high-speed trains was 
that it looked to them as if China hadn't achieved higher speeds by 
innovating but by cutting corners on safety. That argument looks a lot 
stronger after the wreck, when so many pundits are comparing the zero 
passenger-death record in the 47-year history of Japan's high-speed Shinkansen system to the record of China's 4-year-old high-speed rail system.
