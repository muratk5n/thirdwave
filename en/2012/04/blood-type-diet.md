# Blood Type Diet

The theory states there are good foods for each blood type. The types
are the result of our evolution, in Africa type O was predominant,
which is the hunter-gatherer type, then the migration to colder
climates created the nomadic B, settled life in villages, farms
created the A. The last one to arrive is AB which is a mix of both A
and B.

On top of the main types, there is the secretor status. In the
genetics of the secretor system two options exist. A person can be
either a Secretor or a Non-secretor. This is completely independent of
whether you are a blood type A, B, AB, or O. This means that someone
can be an A Secretor or an A Non-secretor, a B Secretor or a B
Non-secretor etc.

There are lab tests to determine this status. Some clues, being a
Non-secretor offers a slight increase risk for having a problem with
habitual snoring. Non-secretors tend to have more digestive
problems. The easiest way to handle this one is if a food item has
AVOID for either _S or _NS for the same type, to avoid it, to be on
the safe side.
