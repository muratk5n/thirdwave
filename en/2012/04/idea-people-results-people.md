# Idea People, Results People

Link

I liked this quote from Hugh MacLeod the other day: "Idea-Driven People come up with Ideas (and Results), more often than Results-Driven People come up with Results (and Ideas)". His quote brings up two related fallacies. People who are good at one thing must be bad at something else. People who specialize in something must be good at it. Neither of these is necessarily true.

Correct. According to MBTI system Rationals have strong intuition (a constant idea generating mechanism, the N in NP) and strong thinking -- a combination that also makes them results, goal oriented. Idealists can also be strong on results if they develop this ability, but if neglected, Ni, Ne can go wild but fail to finish anything. The quote probably focused on this category of people (for results) which is misleading.
