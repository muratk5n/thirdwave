Kuka, the largest European maker of industrial robots, is creating a regional hub in China to develop sales in a country where rising wages are lifting demand for automated factory gear [..] “China alone bought 15,000 robots last year, and we expect that number to rise to about 20,000 this year,” Mr. Reuter said.

Rising wages, a push for quality and demands for faster production are prompting the Chinese manufacturing industry to buy more robots, helping European companies like Kuka and ABB turn lagging businesses into profit centers.

“Salary inflation is the driving force behind robot demand in China,” Michel Demare, the ABB chief financial officer, said in February.
