# Ladies and Gentlemen, the Higgs Boson has been found!

I know that I should probably not be doing this but I am too excited not to: I have it on very
 good authority from a prominent experimental physicist in the middle of
 the action that CERN will indeed be announcing the discovery of the 
Higgs Boson tomorrow in Geneva. Here is how my [..] contact 
puts it: "It's 5 sigma more or less, and I am sure there will be some debate about
 the semantics of calling it a "discovery" or not but more or less it is
 a discovery...it's there! Probably the most boring and exciting moment 
in physics..."
