# Is hardware getting soft?

Everyone now knows how easy it’s become to launch a software startup. 
You can do it for virtually no capital, by just learning the skills of 
coding and using widely available infrastructure services [..]

But what some are beginning to realize is that the same is becoming true
 of hardware. It’s getting easier to do a hardware startup. With 
Jawbone, Sifteo, Pebble, Nest, Makerbot, Dropcam, and many others (I 
invested in OUYA, the new Android game console — in part to learn more 
about this), it’s clear a movement is on.

We all witness the changes brought about white collar force replacing blue collar workers, because of knowledge work. This change has fueled all social change in the world. And this is only the beginning. If and when hardware goes soft, then things will get really heat up.
