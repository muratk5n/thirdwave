Three years ago Mr Erdogan promised to address Kurdish demands but has
done little other than lift some restrictions on the use of the
Kurdish language. These gestures have been outweighed by the arrest of
several thousand Kurdish activists, politicians and academics, often
for the flimsiest of links to the PKK. The arrests mean that the
rebels retain strong support and a steady flow of recruits from the
country's 15 million Kurds. Many observers fear hopes for a political
settlement are fading. The younger generation of Kurds, embittered by
growing up in the midst of a 28-year-old conflict, are more radical
than their elders.
