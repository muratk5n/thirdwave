# Arschbombe

Diving ass-first into pool / sea and splashing the maximum amount of water towards  the by-standers, or just up in the air  apparently has  a name in Germany -- Arschbombe (ass bomb). :) We used to do this when in our youth (well ok, I still do this sometimes) and I thought my technique was perfect. Someone at Universitat Beyreuth did some research, and the best Arschbombe form, optimizing for the most amount of splash is seen to the left. Awesome.
