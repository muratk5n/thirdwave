# Uncertainty, Clockwork, Science

Some people, of previous Marxist persuasion, having been burned badly
by their previous choice and long since moved to other pastures, try
to explain their misfortune by saying Marx's reliance on science was
wrong. "It was also a time when science thought it knew everything, it
saw a linear world" etc, etc.. These people sadly cant still tell
their head from their ass - which is entirely too bad.

Science, especially the kind that started in Renaissance, had
uncertainty baked in from day one. Most people know about the
Descartes' quote that goes "I think therefore I am". Most do not know
the rest of that sentence however. The full quote goes like this: "I
think therefore I am, of nothing else I can be certain".

Mechanical view of things around us, the clockwork universe outlook
crept into the system (and persisted) due to the mechanization of
society, and that is due to second wave effects. Today, we play with
non-linear models, use probability theory, and when we linearize for
faster computation or simplification, always knowing what that choice
entails, the trade-offs, while always watching for knowing what we do
not know. This science has achieved tremendous amounts. You are
enjoying the fuits of it everytime you do a Google search.

And this outlook of science is no different from Descartes' or
Newton's. History is relative, future uncertain, seek knowledge,
create (like mad). Creation / confirmation cycle.. this is at the core
of science.
