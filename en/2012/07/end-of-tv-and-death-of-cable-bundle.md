# The End of TV and the Death of the Cable Bundle

Two small pieces of news yesterday could make for a big headache for
TV.

First,
 Viacom yanked its 19 channels -- including Nickelodeon, MTV and Comedy 
Central -- from DirecTV [..] Big deal, you might say, so DirecTV people can't watch "South Park" and techies can get a crappy stream of "The View" on their iPad. That's not a wrong interpretation of the news, but it's too narrow. The bigger story here is the death of the bundle.

Every year, 100 million homes pay for a bundle of cable channels. 
Like any bundle, it's hard to see exactly what they are paying for. That
 is somewhat the point of bundling -- to disguise the true cost of the 
constituent item [..]

But à la carte would blow up television, which has been the most 
dependable and lucrative business model in modern entertainment history.
 The Internet gutted the music industry. Print journalism has been 
forced to innovate or die -- or, sometimes, both simultaneously -- in 
response to the Web. The American movie industry has survived 
fundamentally because it learned to diversify away from the terms 
"American" and "movie industry" -- most of their revenue now comes from 
overseas and "merchandise-able" franchises. But the cable bundle is 
still basically the cable bundle, and it is still growing by hundreds of
 thousands of subscribers a year. Innovation is an answer to a problem. 
As long as cable providers don't have a revenue problem, they have less 
need to innovate [..]

The Internet is ruthlessly efficient at 
stripping cross-subsidies and 
allowing content to shine on its own. (As Jim Fallows has pointed out, 
newspapers once paid for international coverage with classifieds and 
cars. Now, if you want classifieds and cars, you go to a classifieds 
site or a cars site. Bye-bye, cross-subsidy.)

Bundling implies mass distribution, 21st century will be about choice, personal selection, personalization.
