# Concentrated Regulation

It seems that whereever there is high concentration, there is failure. "Fixing rates between banks scandal" is another example. Is regulation the solution? Actually there is no mismatch between concentrated regulatory bodies regulating concentrated finance insitutions. Backward-ass second wave institutions can play any kind of cat-and-mouse games between eachother, and they can somehow make it work. This was never the problem.

The problem is now there are way too many disconnected, distributed actors in the scene, gaining importance because of technology (not globalization). Backward-ass shit system can do its thing, but when they involve such forces (people) into their fold, not only as customers but stakeholders, than all hell can break loose.

It is impossible to regulate such diverse forces through concentrated means. This is the root of the problem.
