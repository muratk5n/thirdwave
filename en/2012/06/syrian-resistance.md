# Syrian Resistance

INHO the model for Syrian resistance should be Afganistan during the 80s. Arms are provided to motivated resistance fighters and nearby countries act as safe havens. The strengths of Syrian regime needs to be taken out of the equation. Assad's advantages are heavy artillery, and with it, the ability to shell a town from afar, terrorizing its citizens and through them the Free Syrian Army. How can FSA target this artillery? Can they be provided with remote controller airborne attack weaponary that they can use from inside a town if it is surrounded? Conventional wisdom says tanks fight tanks, airplanes fight airplanes, so artillery should fight artillery. Not true. We are living in the age of asymmetry.

FSA needs mobile, portable heavy weapons as well, BTW.
