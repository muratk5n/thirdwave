# The 100,000-student classroom

Excellent talk. I am looking forward for the results that Norvig and 
colleagues might find in their student interaction data. My choice for 
online classes leans toward "disconnected" mode of learning -- through 
videos that are not necessarily interactive (that is video does not 
stop, wait for answer and validate it programmatically). Videos, along 
with all class material (pdf,code) should downloadable in one big batch.
 One click. I think depth, as well as breadth, is important in teaching, with different possible paths perhaps being provided throughout the course material, 
for different goals.

Learning is about information, the more of it available, presented in different angles, the better. Student needs to bring motivation to the table themselves which can be easier if more information isÂ  available online.

Peer to peer learning is a great tool; a memorable quote "peers can be best teachers because they remember how it is not to understand something". Again we come back to providing more routes into knowledge, a peer can  provide that one route the teacher perhaps (surely?) missed during the class.
