# How to Lie With Statistics

Bill Kristol notes that “Four presidents in the last century have won
 more than 51 percent of the vote twice: Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Reagan
 and Obama”. I’m not sure why Kristol, a conservative, is promoting
 the idea that Obama has a mandate, but that’s up to him. I’m more
 interested in the remarkable bit of cherry-picking that led to this
 “only four presidents” statistic.

There was one way in which Obama’s victory was large: he won the
electoral college 332-206. That’s a thrashing. But if you want to
claim that Obama has a “popular mandate” — which people seem to
interpret as an overwhelming preference of The People such that the
opposition is morally obligated to give way — you can’t make that
argument based on the electoral college, you have to look at the
popular vote. That presents you with a challenge for the 2012
election, since Obama’s 2.7-point margin in the popular vote was the
12th-smallest out of the 57 elections we’ve had. There’s a nice
sortable table at Wikipedia if you would like to look at the numbers.

This is actually a big problem in second wave representative systems
(sadly not democracies); both sides play the game equally well now,
come too close to eachother in popular vote or electoral college -
then you win an election by a few hundred votes in Florida, what do
you have the mandate for? For cutting taxes? For invading a country
under false pretenses, causing deaths of thousands in the process?

Alternatively you dont win big in the popular vote, then you might get
to sit on the desk, but dont have a mandate.  Oh and at the same time,
the opposition also "won" the last election, they are now firmly
entrenched in Congress, while crisis looms in the future.

Are these the signs of a functioning system?
