# Newsweek says goodbye to printing presses

“As a former editor in chief of Psychology Today, I know how hard it
 can be to sell magazines,” begins a letter in the current edition of
 Newsweek.  “But how do you get from a neurosurgeon’s report about his
 near-death experience to your cover headline?” A thumbnail opposite
 the letter shows the previous issue. It is emblazoned with the words
 “HEAVEN IS REAL”.

Not even the discovery of an afterlife was enough to save Newsweek.
 The current affairs magazine, which had been due to celebrate its
 80th anniversary next year, has announced that its December 31st
 edition will be the last time it rolls off the printing presses in
 the US.
