# PersonalWeb

In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, then a researcher at CERN, invented the
World Wide Web as we know it. When he created it, he could have chosen
a path wherein the Web would have remained under his control. Instead,
he chose to share his work with the world. Thanks to that decision,
the standards behind the Web are free to all [..]But now and then an
individual, a nation, or a company decides that this should not be the
case. Today that company is PersonalWeb, a shell company from the
Eastern District of Texas, which has set out on a course of patent
litigation against some of the largest Internet companies in an
attempt to claim the Web as their own.In December of 2011 they filed a
series of suits against Amazon, Caringo, EMC, Google, Hewlett-Packard,
and NetApp regarding a bevy of software patents they partially
hold.They have followed this action up recently with even more
lawsuits, this time against the likes of Apple, Facebook, IBM,
Microsoft, and Yahoo. They even accidentally sued Rackspace, a company
that merely hosts Github, the company they were actually trying to
assault.For several years, now, through our campaign to end software
patents, we have been warning people that a day would come when simply
running a Web site could subject you to a ruinous patent lawsuit. It
appears that this day has come.
