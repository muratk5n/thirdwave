# Chaos

Another show that chronicles the collapse of bureucracy, like 24:
Chaos. The show takes place in the CIA: a new recruit joins a
tightly-knit team, and we see bureucratic office politics, risk
averseness of the old order. 24 showed the collapse of the system
using serious acting, action and irony [1], Chaos does it with all of
the above, plus comedy.

This exchange between new recruit and his office buddy displays the
spirit of the show:

OB: Here is your PC. It comes with Windows 97 installed.

NR: You are kidding me right?

OB: You are familiar with the IRS, US Postal Service, FEMA. What do they all have in common?

NR: They're government-run agencies?

OB: As is the CIA. And when was the last time you walked in the Post Office and shouted "my God I stepped into the future!".

[1] The irony of 24 actually was the superhumanness of Jack Bauer. He
succeeded in his missions, but his almost superhuman abilities were
signalled something else: It took that much more personal effort to
cover the shortcomings of the system, and since that kind of ability
being a near impossibility in the real world, we conclude that things
are not fine. Examples of dysfunction is shown at all levels: in one
scene, senator X tells Jack Bauer "son, let the system work / help
you". The man is promptly killed in the next scene, by a terorist.

The message is clear. TARFU, and FUBAR.
