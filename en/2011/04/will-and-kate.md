# Will and Kate

There are cynics, the so called republicans in Britain who would like to see the monarchy abolished. I would argue though, in this day and age of celebrity the royal family members are by definition celebrities hence all marketing, branding has been done for them, and they already have a sizeable crowd of followers all over the world. People are interested in what they do, and that gives them certain amount of influence. They can use this influence for their country, or in general, for humanitarian issues; Isn't UN appointing goodwill ambassadors from among celebrities these days? Well, Brits have that already in form of their royal family.

Let's not forget, historically British royals followed a different "evolutionary path" than, say, French royals; The French have confused feelings about their unelected few bcz they were conquered brutally by the Romans, instinctively associating any royal with the conqueror, in one hand wanting to be like them, on the other wanting to get rid of them, finally accomplishing exactly that, only to put a President in its place who is exactly like a king and acts royal.

French ppl are really f...ed up in the head, basically.

British monarchs followed a less centralized path and carry less baggage in comparison. Even the selection process for knighthoods are not exactly centralized; they are decided through a rather mysterious process which does not depend on any single person. There is more: the interest in the royal family could also have something to do with them being the last bastion where modernity has never reached entirely. They were not "standardized" as the rest of the society, they remain outside the mainstream. People like that difference, maybe even more now since they are shedding their modernist skins themselves along with its one-size-fits-all mentality.

There are specific examples when this "difference" came in handy. When a particularly brutal EU standardization wanted to force all cheesemakers to use pasteurized milk, guess who came in their defense? A certain Prince Charles.

In any case:

I wish a happy life to both newlyweds.
