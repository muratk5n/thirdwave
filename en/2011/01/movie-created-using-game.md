# Movie created using a Game

Someone created, "directed" a movie using only the game Grand Theft
Auto. I guess he played parts of GTA the way he wants his movie to
come out, and he recorded these scenes at the same time. He toiled
away for 2 years on this. Amazing.

This is a brand new way of directing here! Holywood, take notice.
