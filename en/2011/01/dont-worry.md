# Dont Worry

I talked about how blood type ties into character traits. Type O is sports oriented, A is more settled, B's are tall, etc. I do not mean if you are not of type O, you are a wuss. I am just saying being a sports spectator and running after a ball for 90 minutes might not be your thing. That kind of sustained physical exertion is a type O business.

In matters of survival though, of course, all types are equal. I know a fantastic street fighter of type A. I know many martial artists of type B (this type is also physically the strongest). In fact I speculated some time ago since type A is the "farmer" blood type [1], the development of martial arts in China and Japan would tie directly in to them. Here comes the Samurai trying to tax you, and farmers of Okinawa develop karate and kick their ass.

So do not despair. You are not a wuss.
