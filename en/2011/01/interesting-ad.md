# Interesting Ad

Interesting, somewhat spine chilling ad. Love the evil laugh. Muhaha. The was most likely sponsored by people with liberterian leanings who are against government intervention of any sort -- in order to get their point across they chose the baddest nemesis they could think of: the Chinese. I cant say I agree with all the analysis of the ad, but it is well done.
