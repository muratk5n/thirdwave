# Blair / Hitchens Debate

It had its interesting, sometimes funny moments, but overall, no new
arguments were presented, and I feel we are way past these two
gentleman on this issue. The division between science and religion
naturally came up, however, this division is a misnomer. Isaac Newton
researched both, lots of religious people contributed to science, of
which, Bayes is memorable for his contributions (to the field of
probability), and that's Reverend Bayes to you. In Islamic world the
same was true, Al-Ghazali is the best known example [1].

So really, if there is any division, it is between Rome and religion /
science, not science and religion. The Catholic Church did oppose
science, of course, but this confirms my theory presented in this blog
earlier in the post The Godfather. After the Roman Empire's collapse,
the Catholic Church took its mantle, preserved ceremonies, outlook on
life, culture. So during the birth of Renaissance it was Rome Version
1.2 -- the Catholic Church that was around; naturally it way they who
fought science, freedom, pluralism. If the fucking Romans were around,
believe me, they would do the exact same thing.

The backwardness of people who lived under Rome Version 2.0
(Byzantium) and Version 3.0 (Ottomans) is a living proof of my
argument.

[1] Later Ottomans came in the picture of course, and messed it all
up. It is notable that Golden Age of Islam does not include the
pathetic, corrupt and despotic years of their rule.
