# You Are How You Work

Here is the key point behind all waves analysis; we are how we work. Then, in order to answer big questions on societal issues, we have to understand how the majority of the people make a living.

If people's work requires them to be in a farm, follow seasonal patterns, they will be the kind of person that requires that life. Their life will be slow, revolve around big families (more labor), and they will have many skills be a jack-of-all-trades, because agricultural life require it. Hence a country with peasants will have a peasant character.

If many people in a country are blue-collar workers, they will be forced to specialize, to work on standardized units of work, be on-time, and be syncronized. This is a life that revolves around the assembly line. Hence a country with mindless assembly line workers will have a modernist character.

Again: We are looking at the majority of the people.

If most people in a country are in white collar jobs, need to think independently, work in descynchronized jobs (email, version control are all desynchronized tools for instance), then a country with such people cannot be managed in a modernist matter.

That is why our current system will fall.
