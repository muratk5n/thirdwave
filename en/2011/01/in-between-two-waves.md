# In Between Two Waves

American political system was born in between two waves -- whilst in transition from agricultural life into industrial one. This little historical luck was probably instrumental in helping Americans to manage their affairs efficiently during another transitional period -- this time from industrial into knowledge based era.

However, this historical luck might have an ugly side.

A system built during a transitional period might forever be doomed to stay in it. America is in danger to forever remain in transition, between 2. and 3. waves this time, in order to move forward they need to adapt quickly, reward successes, push risk takers out on front in order to create a new civilization.

I am optimistic about their chances tho, after all, US is the furthest among other nations in 3rd wave.

For now.
