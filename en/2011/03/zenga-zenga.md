# Zenga Zenga

Hillarious.. Zenga zenga means "alley by alley" in Libyan Arabic, obviously Gadhafi is talking about killing "dogs", "vermin" alley by alley -- by which he means his countrymen. Apparently these words now form the chorus part of this skillfully remastered "song". Crowdsourced content at your service.

Feeeeel the power of the 3rd Wave Luke.

Note: Gadhafi's image at his speech comes pretty close to Hitler's at one of his "rallies" which must be why the video was created by a Jew / Israeli. Arabs dont seem to care about this tho, as the ills of dictatorship knows no borders, or cultures.

Nicely done.
