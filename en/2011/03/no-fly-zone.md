# No-Fly Zone

Now that the Arab League called for a No-Fly zone over Libya, and it is known that the opposition inside Libya wants this, preferably after a UN Security Council decision, a no-fly zone over Libya should be enforced ASAP. It will be useful. I would not support anything more at this point.

Libya is different from Egypt, in that a million people going somewhere by foot, and staying there, and forcing change is not possible. Libya is a vast country, larger than Texas and populated only by ~ 6 million people. Then in case of civil unrest (war) the side with the best logistics wins, and that side is the incumbent forces I'm afraid.
