# Chavez says capitalism may have ended life on Mars

From Reuters:

"I have always said, heard, that it would not be strange that there had been civilization on Mars, but maybe capitalism arrived there, imperialism arrived and finished off the planet," Chavez said in speech to mark World Water Day.

This guy is batshit crazy.
