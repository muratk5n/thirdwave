# The Fundamentals of Industrial Ideologies: Maximization

The split-up of production and consumption also created, in all Second
Wave societies, a case of obsessive "macro-philia"—a kind of Texan
infatuation with bigness and growth. If it were true that long
production runs in the factory would produce lower unit costs, then,
by analogy, increases in scale would produce economies in other
activities as well. "Big" became synonymous with "efficient" and
maximization became the fifth key principle.

Cities and nations would boast of having the tallest skyscraper, the
largest dam, or the world's biggest miniature golf course. Since
bigness, moreover, was the result of growth, most industrial
governments, corporations, and other organizations pursued the ideal
of growth frenetically.

Japanese workers and managers at the Matsushita Electric Company would
jointly chorus each day:

```
... Doing our best to promote production,
Sending our goods to the people of the world,
Endlessly and continuously.
Like water gushing from a fountain.
Grow, industry, Grow, Grow, Grow!
Harmony and sincerity!
Matsushita Electric!
```

In 1960, as the United States completed the stage of traditional
industrialism and began to feel the first effects of the Third Wave of
change, its fifty largest industrial corporations had grown to employ
an average of 80,000 workers each. General Motors alone employed
595,000, and one utility, Vail's AT&T, employed 736,000 women and
men. This meant, at an average household size of 3.3 that year, that
well over 2,000,000 people were dependent upon paychecks from this one
company alone—a group equal to one half the population of the entire
country when Hamilton and Washington were stitching it into a
nation. [..]

AT&T was a special case and, of course, Americans were peculiarly
addicted to bigness. But macrophilia was no monopoly of the
Americans. In France in 1963 fourteen hundred firms—a mere 1 percent
of all companies—employed fully 38 percent of the work
force. Governments in Germany, Britain, and other countries actively
encouraged mergers to create even larger companies, in the belief that
larger scale would help them compete against the American giants.

Nor was this scale maximization simply a reflection of profit
maximization. Marx had associated the "increasing scale of industrial
establishments" with the "wider development of their material
powers". Lenin, in turn, argued that "huge enterprises, trusts and
syndicates had brought the mass production technique to its highest
level of development." His first order of business after the Soviet
revolution was to consolidate Russian economic life into the smallest
possible number of the largest possible units. Stalin pushed even
harder for maximum scale and built vast new projects—the steel complex
at Magnitogorsk, another at Zaporozhstal, the Balkhash copper smelting
plant, the tractor plants at Kharkov and Stalingrad. He would ask how
large a given American installation was, then order construction of an
even larger one.

In The Cult of Bigness in Soviet Economic Planning, Dr. Leon M. Herman
writes: "In various parts of the USSR, in fact, local politicians
became involved in a race for attracting the 'world's largest
projects.'" By 1938 the Communist party warned against "gigantomania,"
but with little effect Even today Soviet and East European communist
leaders are victims of what Herman calls "the addiction to bigness'

Such faith in sheer scale derived from narrow Second Wave assumptions
about the nature of "efficiency." But the macrophilia of industrialism
went beyond mere plants. It was reflected in the aggregation of many
different kinds of data into the statistical tool known as Gross
National Product, which measured the "scale" of an economy by totting
up the value of goods and services produced in it This tool of the
Second Wave economists had many failings. From the point of view of
GNP it didn't matter whether the output was in the form of food,
education and health services, or munitions. The hiring of a crew to
build a home or to demolish one both added to GNP, even though one
activity added to the stock of housing and the other subtracted from
it GNP also, because it measured only market activity or exchanges,
relegated to insignificance a whole vital sector of the economy based
on unpaid production—child-rearing and housework, for example.
