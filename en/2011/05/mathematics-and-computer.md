# Mathematics and the Computer

"It is impossible to exaggerate the extent to which modern applied mathematics has been shaped and fueled by the general availability of fast computers with large memories. Their impact on mathematics, both applied and pure, is comparable to the role of the telescopes in astronomy and microscopes in biology".

â€” Peter Lax
