# Worst ever carbon emissions leave climate on the brink

Link

Greenhouse gas emissions increased by a record amount last year, to the highest carbon output in history, putting hopes of holding global warming to safe levels all but out of reach, according to unpublished estimates from the International Energy Agency.

The shock rise means the goal of preventing a temperature rise of more than 2 degrees Celsius – which scientists say is the threshold for potentially "dangerous climate change" – is likely to be just "a nice Utopia", according to Fatih Birol, chief economist of the IEA. It also shows the most serious global recession for 80 years has had only a minimal effect on emissions, contrary to some predictions.

This is really messed up. Someone needs to start collecting data on worst polluters, map them out on Google Maps, and organize protests on these locations. I've seen a coal based power plant in Las Vegas, with stacks, mini-mountains of coal waiting to be burned, and the guy working there says one of those little mountains equals only to one hour of electricity for Las Vegas. This is f.cked up shit. Governments are asleep at the wheel. But then again, why should that be a surprise?
