# Institutional Decay Will Continue

After Bin Laden's assasination surely some US agencies are feelin' good right now. But "concentrating" resources to handle one single thing (or a few) was something that second wave systems were already good at. This is nothing new. "Good" management (Obama in this case) makes things better, "bad" management messes things up; there is a certain cycle to this -- but the issue that is not dealt with properly are predicting, coping with the unexpected, handling the distributed, asynchronized nature of our on-the-go knowledge based life. Here "central" agencies will continue to have a difficult time.
