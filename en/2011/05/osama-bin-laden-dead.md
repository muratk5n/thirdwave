# Osama bin Laden Dead

Great news. As we wrote before in Bloodshed and the Roman Empire [..]
According to Bernard Lewis' What Went Wrong? Bin Laden talks about a
saddening point in time in history and mentions the year 1918. Most
people in the world do not know the significance that year, but people
in Asia Minor know it very well. It is a great day (in my view)
because it's the time when the Ottoman Empire finally collapsed. Sadly
what came in its place wasnt that great either, but I am just glad
that the old archaic structure finally disappeared. Now what do we
have here? Rome Version 3.0, which represents another authrotic,
despotic marriage between centralized religion and state, this
structure collapses and Bin Laden is SAD ABOUT THAT. This is the same
Bin Laden who is responsible for thousands of deaths in 9/11.

Nuf said.
