# Blaxploitation

The train of thought started while I was listening to J. J. Johnson's
song Willie Chase (great funk) -- I looked up the song, and started
reading about blaxploitation movies. There are subgenres, and one
subgenre is .. Westerns!  An example is titled (I kid you not) "Boss
Ni...r". Ex-football player Fred Williamson plays a sheriff, and the
movie's slogan goes:

"White Man's Town.. Black Man's Law".

About the N word; Richard Pryor was using it during 70s, he was both
pissing off some people, but he wasnt really aware that he was... So I
guess the society took some deciding the issue.
