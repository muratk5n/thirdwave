# More on the Logistic Equation

I [shared](../../2011/11/logistic-equation.md) a world population
prediction. One clarification; the projected death count is not due to
any reduction in birth rates. That reduction is already captured by
the ap part of the equation that goes $dp/dt = ap - bp^2$. The
population reduction we are talking about is measuring people who were
born, but **will die** who otherwise would have lived.

The # we shared at around 2 billion in 60 years can seem
staggering. But if you think about it, at least one million people
died in Iraq last few years. And that was all about access to shared
resources my friend, hence something that $-bp^2$ part of the equation
measures.

One million here, one million there, soon we're talking
billions. Unlikely?
