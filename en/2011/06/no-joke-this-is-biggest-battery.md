# No joke: This is the biggest battery breakthrough ever

News

A pioneer in battery research who already successfully launched a $350
million company to supply batteries to the likes of GE and Chrysler
has done it again -- only this time, "it" represents the complete
reinvention of battery technology as we know it.

This technology is in the research phase, but if it can be
cost-effectively brought to market -- and there's every reason to
believe that it could be -- it could revolutionize the way we store
and transport energy, in the process fully replacing fossil fuels and
especially oil.

The key to this new technology is that the metals that would normally
be solids in a conventional battery have been broken into nano-size
particles that are suspended in a liquid. The batteries, known as
"semi-solid flow cells," store their power in a black gunk that looks
like motor oil, which has earned it the nickname "Cambridge Crude."
Because charge is stored in this liquid, it would be possible to "fuel
up" an electric car with charged liquid electrolyte, just like fueling
up at a conventional gas pump.
