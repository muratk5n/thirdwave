# MIT Weirdness

Here is something weird from one Massachussets Institute of Technology
lecture. In the middle of a mathematics lecture, four guys dressed up
like gangsters a la Reservoir Dogs walk in the classroom, and in
unison go "[clap, clap] dont be late", and the dude on the left points
to someone and adds "that means you pretty boy". Just weird man...  I
like pranks, I like movies, and I have no problems with comedy. But
this is just an odd display of common thugs.In Western terms, inside
that classroom, it is Greece.These fuckers are from Rome.Not cool.
