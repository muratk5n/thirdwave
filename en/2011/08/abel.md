# Abel

Interesting tidbit on the Norwegian mathematician Abel: he apparently
had a tragic life, he made many discoveries but in his lifetime, they
were not recognized. Now he is a national icon in Norway, there is a
huge statue of him in Oslo: but the joke is, since noone knew what he
looked like, they made the statue so big that you cannot see his face
when you are near it.
