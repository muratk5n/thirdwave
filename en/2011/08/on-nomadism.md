# On Nomadism

Blog

Movement is not expensive if the environment is set up to support
it. I am not an extremist or minimalist. I don’t want to be living off
a few packs on a bicycle for the rest of my life. I like warm beds,
hot showers and large, well-equipped kitchens as much as anybody
else. I like having access to lots of useful things like washing
machines and gyms. It is not inconceivable that the world could be
arranged to provide all these in a way that supports both rootedness
and nomadism. Thanks to online friendships, and emerging
infrastructure around couchsurfing and companies like Airbnb, it is
becoming easier every year. I’d like to see trains getting cheaper,
tent-living becoming available for the non-destitute classes, health
insurance becoming more portable, public toilets acquiring shower
stalls, and government identity documents becoming anchored to
something other than physical addresses. I’d like to see the
time-share concept expand beyond vacations to regular living. I’d like
executive suites and coworking spaces sprout up all over, and acquire
cheap bedrooms that you can live out of. I’d like to be able to rent
nap-pods at Starbucks. I’d rather own or rent a twelfth of a home in
twelve cities than one home in one city.

There is no necessary either-or between nomadism and rooted
living. Technology has evolved to the point where the apparatus of the
state should be able to accommodate illegible people without pinning
them down.
