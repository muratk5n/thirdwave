# Broisms

I am having some fun with these.. It started with quid-pro-bro, brocassion, bromance; now there is an entire dictionary about this stuff. They are 'broisms'. Some other ones:

Brofessional: A dude who has devoted himself fully to bro
activities. Obviously this includes beer drinking, playing videogames,
etc.

Broverload: Anytime someone feels uncomfortable with the number of
bros in a confined space.

Brogrammer: A bro who somehow learned to program, but would deny it in
any social situation.

Broller Coaster: a roller coaster full of obnoxious bro's that scream
excessively even when the ride has come to a full stop.

Brotein: What bros drink in order to become more attractive towards
other bro hoes.

Brolitude: When one decides on something consisting of only him and
his bros.

Brocean: A collection of bros. It is ruled by broseidon, and most of
its citizens have quality flow and play lax.
