# Things Are Getting Out Of Hand

Just wanted to make people aware of a company called Kolera that is sending threatening letters via their law firm, manatt, phelps, phillips in regard to violation of their patent U.S. Patent No. 6,275,821 titled "Method and System for Executing a Guided Parametric Search.

Apparently, they believe that this patent gives them the rights to faceted search technology. Consequently, anyone who uses this technology without paying licensing fees is potentially a target of litigation. They have outstanding suits with companies such as Microsoft and Ebay.

Someone patented "faceted search"? This is basically categorical search that is used by almost every e-commerce site. Ok; This is really getting annoying. Hello? This is spending time with unnecessary bullshit, people.. The result of the previous idioacy was the housing bubble. Now unnecessary time and money is wasted in legalese, and on bloody lawyers. The system is destroying itself, and is trying very hard to do it.
