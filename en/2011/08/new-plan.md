# New Plan?

Obama indicated he will have a new plan for the economy; I hope it's creative and appropiate for 21st century. If it's not, he will get slammed badly. Whether they like it or not Hesitant Creators must be active creatively, when they fall short in that department, people around them intuitively sense this and start criticizing. The criticism can double because of the expectations around HCs, that they are not fullfilling their potential, and its effect can quadruple because of these people's generally low self-esteem. Shit just spirals down after that, HC will either try to accomodate someone, or be unnecessarily competitive with whoever criticizes, in an completely unrelated direction -- that's a sign they fucked up.

Best way to avoid all that, is to create, do it in a smart way and be courageous while doing it.
