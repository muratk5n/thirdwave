# Mandela

From The World According to Clarkson

[Mandela] is not Gandhi, you know. You may like what he represents – I do – but if you peer under the halo of political correctness that bathes him in a golden glow of goodness you’ll find that the man himself is a bit dodgy.

Back in the early 1960s he was the one who pushed the ANC into armed conflict. He was known back then as the Black Pimpernel. And his second marriage was to Winnie, who’s now a convicted fraudster and thief with, we’re told, a penchant for Pirelli necklaces.

Furthermore, since his release from prison and his eventual rise to the presidency Mandela has had some extraordinary things to say about world affairs. He’s deeply concerned, for instance, about the plight of one of the Lockerbie bombers and has expressed support for both Gadaffi and Castro. Indeed, he has singled out Cuba, praising it for its human rights and liberty. I’m sorry – what human rights, what liberty? [..]
