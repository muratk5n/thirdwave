# The Patent Pledge

Paul Graham

I've never been 100% sure whether patents help or hinder technological
progress. When I was a kid I thought they helped. I thought they
protected inventors from having their ideas stolen by big
companies. Maybe that was truer in the past, when more things were
physical. But regardless of whether patents are in general a good
thing, there do seem to be bad ways of using them. And since bad uses
of patents seem to be increasing, there is an increasing call for
patent reform.
