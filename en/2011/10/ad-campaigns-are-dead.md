# Ad Campaigns Are Dead

Link

We can all agree that we're increasingly social and because of that, the tables have turned. Power has shifted away from brands to consumers. If you have any doubt, consider two recent announcements: Facebook doubling its revenue the first half of the year to $1.6 billion and Nielsen's "State of Social" report that reinforces the massive amount of time spent interacting in online social environments.

If you told Don Draper that campaigns as he knew them would die in his lifetime, he would have fired you. Even today, in 2011, after being hit over the head with consumer empowerment, the ad industry is still reluctant to face a very stark reality: it's no longer the advertiser that controls the message, it's the recipient. The social consumer is so much more multi-dimensional than a seasonal retail push.
