The U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
voted Monday to admit Palestine into the organization as its newest
member, and the United States promptly responded by cutting off
funding for the agency.

Are you kidding me?

Well, I guess the election season is in full swing now.. Gotta cozy up
to those pro-Israel lobbies! Dont miss your chance! $9.99 if you call
now! Hurry up!
