# More on Leaders

We talked about the Leave the Child Behind pysch type; interestingly
both Sarkozy and Merkel are LCBs. I hear lots of complaints about both
for not being quick enough on responding to the recent EU crises, not
taking responsibility to save the European economy, etc.. Well; how
much of that can be attributed to general slowness of EU institutions,
how much is their LCB type's fault is debatable. Yet another question
is if it is even possible to have any gigantic mechanism such as the
EU (or the US) to survive the tectonic shifts caused by the 3rd
Wave. Anyhow; maybe some of the slowness has to do with their LCB.
