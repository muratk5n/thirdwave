A Ph.D. is a long, in depth research exploration of one topic. By long
we’re typically talking about 6 years. By in depth we mean that at the
end of the Ph.D. you will be the world expert or close to it in your
particular area. You will know more than your advisor about your
particular research area. You will know about your research than
anyone at your school. By one we mean that by the last couple years of
your Ph.D., you will typically be working on only one narrow
problem. The Ph.D. is not about breadth, it is about depth.

Lack of emphasis on courses

The M.S. and B.A. degrees are about breadth not depth. The main
requirement in the M.S. and B.A. degrees is often a large numbers of
courses. A B.A. or M.S. in CS often entails taking 3 or 4 classes each
semester. In contrast, a Ph.D. program typically requires typically
less than 10 courses during the entire 6 years (at CMU there are 5
required “core” courses, and 3 required “electives”). The emphasis in
the Ph.D. is not on classes, but rather on research. A Ph.D. student
will typically take classes only when she feels that they will be
useful in her research. The classes she takes may not even be in CS at
all. They may be in Statistics, Operations Research, Math, Psychology,
Linguistics, or anything else useful for her particular research
topic.

The research process and advisor/advisee relationships: As stated
earlier, the main focus of a Ph.D. is research. You typically begin
your research at the time when you select an advisor. At most schools
you pick an advisor sometime after your first year. At CMU, we like
you to start research right away, so you pick an advisor within a
month or two of starting the program.

Research is very different from taking classes. Many students never
make the transition between taking classes and doing research – in
fact, at most schools only 1/2 of the students who enter the
Ph.D. program leave with a Ph.D. (at CMU, about 3/4 end up with a
Ph.D.). Keep in mind that we’re typically talking about students who
came in with 4.0 GPA’s from a top undergraduate program

Some key differences between classes and research:

In classes, the homework problems all have known answers and the
techniques needed for solving the problems have (usually) been
introduced in class. In research, you may be working on a problem for
years without a clue of whether it is solvable. You will be the one
inventing or finding the techniques for solving the problem.

• In classes, you are assigned certain problems to work on. In
  research, you get to pick the problems. In fact it is your job to
  find good problems. By “good” we mean problems which are
  “fundamental.” For example, finding a system hack which makes a
  particular product like Cisco’s Local Director run better is
  something that Cisco would love, but would not count as fundamental
  research. However discovering better algorithms for the problem of
  task assignment of jobs to hosts in a server farm is considered
  fundamental research. You are also responsible for making sure that
  no one else has already solved this problem. This typically involves
  reading hundreds of papers on earlier research in this area.

• In classes, if you can’t solve your homework problem, you can always
  ask other classmates. Even if none of your classmates know, you can
  ask the professor, who certainly knows the answer. In research, you
  are often working alone, or at best with you advisor and maybe one
  other student. You are free to ask anyone in the world for help, but
  they will typically not be able to help you, since they don’t know
  the answer either – if they did, it wouldn’t be research. Many
  students have a hard time with working independently

• In classes, you are constantly being given grades and you are
  constantly being told what to do next. In research, there are no
  grades. There is some instruction (from your advisor), but mostly
  it’s up to you to be self-motivated and pro-active. In the
  classroom, there is a distance between you and your professor. In
  research, you and your advisor will work side-by-side. Your advisor
  will still tell you what to do – give you ideas for problems to work
  on, assign papers for you to read, give you programming assignments,
  and often give you a time-line and schedule. However, when you and
  your advisor are working on a problem together, you will work as
  equals. You will both learn from each other. You will make
  discoveries together. Many students are surprised to find that their
  advisor is very different in research than in the classroom. A
  professor who is very dry in the classroom and often looks bored and
  uncomfortable will often become extremely enthusiastic and excited
  when working on research problems. In the classroom, you hear your
  professor discuss results which he/she has already worked out. All
  problems are always solved by the end of lecture. In research, you
  will watch your advisor think out loud and see how he/she thinks and
  reasons. Students often find this very exciting. You may find that
  you think more quickly than your advisor, but your advisor has more
  ideas than you. Or you may find that you are better at computations
  or coding, but your advisor is better at proofs or writing or
  speaking. This surprises many students, who expect their advisor to
  be better than they are at everything. Don’t pout, this is an
  unrealistic expectation. As in all of life, you will be most
  successful if you simply figure out what skills your advisor has
  that you don’t and work hard at picking up all of those skills
  without complaining.

When taking classes, you will almost never see your professor
alone. When doing research with an advisor, you will typically have 1
hour per week when you meet with your advisor alone. If your advisor
is especially busy (remember, professors have to do research, teach,
apply for grants, serve on committees, fly around giving talks, etc.)
you may only get 1/2 hour a week. If your advisor is a newer faculty,
you may get as much as 2 hours per week. It’s your job to plan ahead
so as to maximize the utility of your time together.

Should I get a Ph.D.?

i. A Ph.D. is not for everyone!

ii. A Ph.D requires 6 years on average. The opportunity cost is high.

iii. Do not even think of applying for a Ph.D. if you have not tried
research and/or teaching and found that you like at least one of
those. (Note: the Ph.D. program will require mostly research, not
teaching, but a love of teaching may help motivate you to get through,
so that you can go on to be a teacher. I have seen many examples of
this.)

iv. A Ph.D. requires a particular type of personality. You need to be
someone who is obsessed with figuring out a problem. You need to have
tremendous perseverance and be capable of hard work. You need to be
willing to do whatever it takes to solve your problem (e.g., take 5
math classes, learn a whole new area like databases, rewrite the whole
kernel, etc.).

v. You need to know why you want a Ph.D. You need to have vision and
ideas and you need to be able to express yourself.∗

vi. Obviously, many people are still unsure straight after a B.A. I
was one of them, so I understand. For such people working in a
research lab or in an industrial lab which involves doing research for
a few years will help them decide. If you are unsure, I highly
recommend working for a few years before starting a Ph.D. Do not apply
to graduate school until you are sure you know what you want.

My own story: After I finished my B.A. in CS and Math, I went to work
at the Advanced Machine Intelligence Lab at GTE in Massachusetts. At
first I was very excited by my paycheck and the great feeling of being
independent. I also really enjoyed my area of research at the time:
pattern recognition and classification. I was working with
frame-of-reference transformations involving eigenvectors of
autocorrelation matrices. It was exciting! However I quickly realized
that I wanted to know more. I wanted to know why some algorithms
produced good results and others didn’t. I wanted to come up with my
own algorithms. I worried that I didn’t have enough of a mathematics
background to answer my own questions. In summary, I wanted to delve
deeper. Everyone around me thought I was very odd for wanting these
things. I left after 2 years and went to graduate school. That first
month of graduate school I looked around and realized that everyone
there was just as weird and obsessed as I was, and I knew I had made
the right decision.

THE PhD: GETTING STARTED

I remember a great summer job I once had at IVIC. A top
neurophysiologist, name of Svaetichin, gave me a splendid
problem... one that I unfortunately could not solve. The problem was
to find a way to focus light on a single cell of a goldfish retina so
that the light would not spill over onto any of the adjacent
cells. Svaetichin had tried making a pinhole in a sheet of black tin,
and shining his light thru the hole. This worked for moderate size
holes, but failed for really small holes, which caused the light to
diverge, to form diffraction patterns.

Since Svaetichin couldn't solve the problem, I decided I couldn't. Or
perhaps it's that I thought his problem physically unsolvable. In
retrospect, I should have taken out books on physics, especially
optics, read as much as I could, talked to others and kept on talking
to him.  Svaetichin would have helped me if I had shown him I was
reading thinking working.

Don't expect your thesis advisor to give you a problem that he or she
can answer. Of course, she might.

* She might give you a problem to which she already knows an answer.
* She might give you a problem that she thinks is answerable,
but that she hasn't actually answered.
* She might give you a problem that is deadly hard.
* If the problem she gives you is hard enough,
I suggest you look for a NONSTANDARD answer.
More on this later after I get done cooking the thesis advisor.

Your thesis advisor may encourage you to work in an area that she
feels completely comfortable in... in which case you can rely on her
for sage advice and sound guidance. Or she may encourage you to work
on something she knows little or nothing about, in which case it will
be up to you to inform and teach her. In the latter case, you will
have to learn all you can for yourself...You will have to learn from
other faculty, from courses, from books, from journals. from
peers. Both kinds of advisors can work out for you. I don't know that
one is necessarily better than the other. But you should know which
you got.

Whatever you do, you got to like doing it.... You got to like it so
much that you're willing to think about it, work on it, long after
everyone else has moved on.

THE PhD: DEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

There's a wonderful quote from ANATOLE FRANCE: "A University Student"
-- and this is especially true for a PhD Student -- "should know
something about everything and everything about something."

You know the jokes about PhD's... A PhD knows more and more about less
and less until he knows everything about nothing.

When working on a PhD, you must focus on a topic so narrow that you
can understand it completely.  It will seem at first that you're
working on the proverbial needle, a tiny fragment of the world, a
minute crystal, beautiful but in the scheme of things,
microscopic.Work with it. And the more you work with it, the more you
penetrate it, the more you will come to see that your work, your
subject, encompasses the world. In time, you will come to see the
world in your grain of sand.

To see a world in a grain of sand

Or a heaven in a wild flower,

Hold infinity in the palm of your hand

And eternity in an hour.

WILLIAM BLAKE (1757-1827)

This gorgeous quartet is followed by a large number of sometimes deep
sometimes questionable aphorisms, which I see much like the
occasionally grinding work of a PhD thesis.

There's all kinds of research you can do.

There's research to prove what you know to be true.

There's research -- maybe better called SEARCH -- to figure out what is true.

Some of the best such search succeeds in DISPROVING

what you initially believed to most certainly be true.

For example, Sir Fred Hoyle is said to have coined the phrase "Big Bang" at a time when he was looking to disprove it.

For a relatively minor but personal example: When I was working on the
MEDIAN problem, my goal was to prove that any deterministic algorithm
to find the MEDIAN of n integers must necessarily make roughly as many
comparisons as it takes to sort n integers, i.e. n log n
comparisons. I was shocked to discover that the median of n integers
can be found with just O(n) comparisons.

When working on proving some statement S true, you should spend at
least some time trying to prove it false. Even if it's true, trying to
prove it false can give insight.And in any case, too often, our
intuition is dead wrong.

There is yet another sense in which, when working on a hard problem,
you may find that the answer is NOT what you expected. You may be
looking for a YES or a NO; it may be something else.
