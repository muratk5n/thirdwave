# The Great Stagnation

"AEI's Nick Schulz interviews economist Tyler Cowen on his new e-book
"The Great Stagnation: How America Ate All The Low-Hanging Fruit of
Modern History, Got Sick, and Will (Eventually) Feel Better.""

I like Cowen's emphasis on science, technology and innovation. These
are the real drivers of growth. I tend to agree with most of his
points, maybe not so wholehartedly with his shortfall of innovation
idea (our categorizations might be tad different). But this is a good
interview nonetheless.
