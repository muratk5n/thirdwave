Take That Kill-Switch and Shove It Up Your Ass

From evilrouters.net

[I]n the United States, the “kill switch” bill has been revived and should be heading back to a Senate committee very soon. Interesting timing, to say the least. Since the removal of Egypt from the Internet, I’ve heard many folks discussing alternative means of communications should the same thing ever happen here (USA) [..]. I haven’t heard mentioned — much — is amateur radio.

If or when the government flips the “kill switch”, I’ll be firing those radios back up. When your Internet connection goes down, your landline is cut off, and the cellular towers are overloaded, you won’t be able to access Twitter or Facebook, but you WILL be able to communicate and get your message out. Somewhere in Egypt right now is a ham radio operator getting his message out to the rest of the world.

In summary, it is possible to use Internet protocols using radio frequencies as a transport mechanism.
