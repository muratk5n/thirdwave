# Great stagnation or external growth?

A nice post on Tyler Cowen's book The Great Stagnation. I think it
connects nicely with our post A New Form of Currency. I tend to favor
the argument that we are innovating (no shortfall there), surely can
do *lots* more, however in order to measure what we are already
innovating, and to provide incentives for more of it, we need to allow
different payment methods.
