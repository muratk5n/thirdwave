# It May Be a Sputnik Moment, but Science Fairs Are Lagging

In many schools, science fairs depend on teachers who shoulder the extra work. They supervise participants and research, raise the money for medals and poster boards, and find judges â€” all on their own time.

I keep saying the education problem cannot solved using the old system which depends on the teacher / student equation. Science fairs seem like extra work, also require people to be "synchronized" -- that is students, teachers all have to work toward a preset finish time. Not good. See my earlier post on teachers, education reform. Let's fire all teachers and let kids work on whatever projects they choose, whenever they want to. They get support from "in-house adults" in their own "living center" when they need to. The rest can come from the Internet.
