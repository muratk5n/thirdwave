# Conservatives for Liberty

I am not sure if this is a big trend yet, but it could be -- some of
my conservative friends are pissed off -let me use a Cheney word here-
BIG TIME about certain neocon types taking a stance against
revolutions in Middle East. Responses we heard from such people so far
ranged from lukewarm to downright hostile, and my conservative peeps
are not happy about this at all. Personally I saw Newt on TV, he was
talking bunch of nonsense, was mad at Obama for supporting the Arab
street, and apparently Glenn Beck literally (and finally) lost his
mind and is rooting for dictators in the Middle East right now. I have
to say, events in this part of the world has been a great litmus test
helping seperate the good from the bad.
