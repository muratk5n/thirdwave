# 400 Hundred Years in a Convent, 50 Years in Hollywood

This is how Philippines describe their history -- I thought it was
funny. The convent part is due to the Spanish colonization I guess,
and the 50 years must be their American "colonization". Not a true
colonization obviously, they probably were a "client-state" of sorts.
