# Nokia

Nokia has truly lost its way. It needs little slapping -- they are thinking of adapting that bullshit American OS called Windows 7!

There is an alternative, Linux, which is written by another Finnish citizen Linux Torvalds -- Linux already powers all of the (Google) Android phones out there which is set to become a true alternative to iPhone.

I would expect better from Nokia, I would expect them to create a Linux, Python based (a language created by a Dane) OS on their own and pull developers toward them who are not wholly committed to Android. Nokia is truly in wilderness right now.

Someone please slap the shit out of them.

Oh, by the way, Google self-driving cars are programmed by a German citizen now in US, his name is Sebastian Thrun... Wake up Europe. Thrun has some interesting criticism on the university system of his home country as well.
