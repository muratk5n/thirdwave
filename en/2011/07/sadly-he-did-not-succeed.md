# Sadly He Did Not Succeed

Well-known coder and activist Aaron Swartz was arrested Tuesday,
charged with violating federal hacking laws for downloading millions
of academic articles from a subscription database service that MIT had
given him access to. If convicted, Swartz faces up to 35 years in
prison and a $1 million fine.Swartz, the 24-year-old executive
director of Demand Progress, has a history of downloading massive data
sets, both to use in research and to release public domain documents
from behind paywalls. Swartz, who was aware of the investigation,
turned himself in Tuesday.My $0.02? People should thank this guy
rather than jail him. Dont Feds have better things to do than chasing
someone who is trying to free stuff / research that was produced
mostly by public funds to begin with?I wonder what the public would
think, vote on, if freeing research was put on a referendum. Public
officials or lawmakers deciding on this and that does not count
because we all know representative system does not mean
democracy.Paywalls around knowledge is wrong, unproductive and just
plain immoral.
