# Apathy

It's useless to badger the US public with doom and gloom scenarios,
and/or begging them to pressure officials. The public's current mood
is one of apathy. They simply do not care. When officials say "raising
the debt ceiling" the public hears "we want more money", and this is
not a message that will get them out of their chairs to do anything. I
feel similarly. I supported the first bail-out. I do not support
raising of the debt ceiling now. Let the chips fall where they may.
