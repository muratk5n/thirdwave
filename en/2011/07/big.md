# Big

Humanity as an organic system evolved to be opposite of this. We are many, because we are our own fail-safe system. Take out small chunk of us, we still survive.

News spread,  they are supposed to spread. Locality mattered, and it still should. A government minister making an off-hand remark in Japan should not effect stock markets in Argentina. Yet this is exactly what happens today.

We need to start thinking about a new computer based social system  to manage all our likes, dislikes, public projects assignments, monitoring of them, crediting or discrediting disreputable people, companies, and all in an Internet style / supported, disconnected fashion. That is the human thing to do. That is the smart thing to do.

Noone should get "big enough" so  when they fall, they cause much ripple  around them. This is both for the good of the public and the person who is at the center.

If I designed software like our current state of humanity today, I assure you I'd be fired before I could say "big". Just take a look at the system. All parts of it is connected to all other parts, yet it is still central somehow, while certain parts get inflated from overuse, other parts remain unused. There are no tests (to check for validity), there are no requirements, it crumbles under moderate load, and noone knows what the f--k is going to happen during its peak hours.

This cannot go on foreever. It won't go on forever.
