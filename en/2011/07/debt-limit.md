# Debt Ceiling

The Murdoch thing, tho a nice development, seems like a well planned move to pressure Reps in US to agree on raising the debt ceiling (by pressuring Fox News, and conservatives). Goal #1 for The Integrators in US is the ability to get into more debt, so the charade can continue indefinitely. In their minds, whoever can get into more debt wins because at time t, they will always have the edge compared to other countries. You can spend more on military, R&D, pull more people, whatever, just because you are spending more than your equals. And the cycle continues. Believe it or not, living beyond your means is a strategic advantage.

But.. the music will have to stop at one point. The system is rotting from within.
