# Twitter Hashtags

I like Twitter's hashtag feature; it allows ppl to cluster around topics quickly. This is especially useful during events & conferences. When people visit a conference they start tagging their messages related to that conference with a hashtag, say #expo2011, then a follower can click on that tag and gets other messages under that tag.

No central authority defines the tag, it is not centralized. The tag simply emerges out of the interactions of people, it's not synchronized. It's not standardized, any word can be a tag, not concentrated either because a tag can be created by one, many people, and mushroom out to entire Internet, or not.

There it is -- the fall of modernity summarized in a simple hashtag.
