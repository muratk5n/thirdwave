Murdoch-bashing has, until very recently, generally been a
disreputable activity, chiefly engaged in by the envious, the
far-left, and the commercially uncompetitive, all almost incapable of
disinterested comment – but not always. It is, on this subject at
last, a time for truth. For decades Britain’s establishment professed
to despise Mr Murdoch but appeased and grovelled to him, (“I
thoroughly disapprove of Rupert, but I quite like him,” was the
tedious refrain), as when it became clear that most of opinionated
London expected him to prevail over the Daily Telegraph in the price
war that he launched in 1993 [..]

Although his personality is generally quite agreeable, Mr Murdoch has
no loyalty to anyone or anything except his company. He has difficulty
keeping friendships; rarely keeps his word for long; is an exploiter
of the discomfort of others; and has betrayed every political leader
who ever helped him in any country, except Ronald Reagan and perhaps
Tony Blair. All his instincts are downmarket; he is not only a tabloid
sensationalist; he is a malicious myth-maker, an assassin of the
dignity of others and of respected institutions, all in the guise of
anti-elitism. He masquerades as a pillar of contemporary, enlightened
populism in Britain and sensible conservatism in the US, though he has
been assiduously kissing the undercarriage of the rulers of Beijing
for years. His notions of public entertainment and civic values are
enshrined in the cartoon television series The Simpsons: all public
officials are crooks and the public is an ignorant
lumpenproletariat. There is nothing illegal in this, and it has
amusing aspects, but it is unbecoming someone who has been the subject
of such widespread deference and official preferments.
