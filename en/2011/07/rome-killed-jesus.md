# Rome Killed Jesus

BBC

The story begins when the Galilean rebel Jesus rides into Jerusalem on
a donkey, deliberately fulfilling a prophecy in the Hebrew Bible about
the coming of the Messiah. [..] The next day Jesus raids the Temple,
the heart of the Jewish religion, and attacks money-changers for
defiling a holy place. The leaders of the Jewish establishment realise
that he threatens their power, and so do the Romans, who fear that
Jesus has the charisma to lead a guerrilla uprising against Imperial
Rome.

Caiaphas was a supreme political operator and one of the most
influential men in Jerusalem [..]. Jesus threatened Caiaphas's
authority [..]. Caiaphas' power base was the Sanhedrin, the supreme
council of Jews which controlled civil and religious law [..]
Sanhedrin only ruled because the Romans allowed them to and the way to
keep the Romans happy was to maintain order in society. Caiaphas
himself was a Roman appointment, so he needed to keep cosy with the
governor, Pilate, if he wanted to stay in power and preserve his
luxurious way of life.
