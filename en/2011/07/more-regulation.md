# More Regulation?

Britain is engulfed in scandal. Many "concentrated" institutions are drawn in the eye of the hurricane; and we the cognetariat are watching it from the sidelines, laughing our asses off at the entire ordeal. "Is more regulation needed?" Ok.. then regulate. "But will it work? Will it hamper newspapers?" Then.. don't. Either way, seriously, we dont give a f..k.

Destroy yourselves.

Man... For a while I was thinking the big changes I talked about here would not take place in my lifetime.

But now I am starting to think I might very well live to see the day.

#fail #bitches

This is so much fun.
