“The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt
limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the
U.S. government can’t pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now
depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to
finance our government’s reckless fiscal policies. … Increasing
America’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally. Leadership
means that ‘the buck stops here.’ Instead, Washington is shifting the
burden of bad choices today onto the backs of our children and
grandchildren. America has a debt problem and a failure of
leadership. Americans deserve better.”

– Barack Obama, 2006
