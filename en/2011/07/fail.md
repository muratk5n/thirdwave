This comment also pissed off Baradai at the time, and he lamented in an interview to Newsweek if I remember correctly. Look here is the problem, a sec state's coworkers are other government officials as well as his / her own. You develop relations with them, and want to keep working with them. That's natural. But this is not revolutionary material, not by a long shot. Plus, US governments foreign policy has always been an extension of its trade policy. Put all these together, while State Department looks less aggressive compared to *some other* US agencies and departments, it still is responsible for furthering US agenda abroad, however that agenda is defined by a central, concentrated government. Period. We need to remember what ex sec state Colin Powell told a French official before the Iraq War: "I am not who you think I am".

That actually could've been the title of this post.
