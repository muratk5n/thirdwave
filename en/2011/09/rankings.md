# Rankings

I saw Malcolm Gladwell on TV the other day.. He was on this CNN show
called Fareed Zakaria BLT. Or, GTE ...? TP? Something like
that. Anyway, Gladwell says university rankings are bunk, because say
#48 and #49 are such different universities that comparing them, let
alone having them in the same ranking is like comparing apples and
oranges.

Gladwell's TED talk had a similar theme. In it he proposed when it
comes to consumption, there is no "best of", but many "bests" to
choose from. We add, standardized rankings are part of industrial /
modernist mentality, a sign of a Taylorist mindset. From an earlier
post:

In the early decades of [20th] century Taylor decided that there was
one best (standard) way to perform each job, one best (standard) tool
to perform it with, and a stipulated (standard) tune in which to
complete it.

In the postmodern world, choices are many.
