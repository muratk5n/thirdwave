A freely accessible index of 5 billion web pages, their page rank,
their link graphs and other metadata, hosted on Amazon EC2, was
announced today by the Common Crawl Foundation. "It is crucial [in]
our information-based society that Web crawl data be open and
accessible to anyone who desires to utilize it," writes Foundation
director Lisa Green on the organization's blog.
