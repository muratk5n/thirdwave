# More on Empires

One clarification on this post: The model we referenced is based on
exponential distribution that says an empire's life (time spent) does
not effect the probability of its continued existence. Notice tho the
model only takes into consideration one kind of variable -- time. If
you stand on a street corner and record arrival times of all the cars
passing that corner, and prepare an histogram for these arrival times,
you would see an exponential distribution. But, if you followed that
one car, tried to understand it in terms of variables other than just
time, than maybe you could predict its complete journey, i.e. when it
would pass your street corner, when or if it would get stuck in
dead-end, crash, etc. IOW better models can provide better
results. The article we referenced was interesting, sure, it used a
concept from industrial engineering and it went one step beyond taking
an average, which is truly the simplest thing you can do. But the
model is just that -- one step beyond a simple average.
