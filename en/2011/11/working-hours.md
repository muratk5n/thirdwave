# Working Hours

If due to increased efficiencies in the economy people are out of
work, the solution cannot be "reduced work hours" -- this would be a
modernist, industrial (therefore backward) solution to the problem;
reduced work hours are another standard, another potential restriction
for business. Instead, government giving out 1K, 2K $ per month to
everyone is better; this gives people the freedom to do whatever they
want with that money, so supply / demand signals still work. The
extraordinary wealth that is created due to high-tech production --
which inherently favors the few -- is shared by everyone.

I repeat: the originator of this idea is not Karl Marx, but Milton
Friedman. Marx, the idealist moron that he was, went to a completely
different (read: wrong) direction.

Another reason why such a distribution mechanism is important: in a
3rd Wave economy is that the outcome of projects become less and less
predictable. It is not a coincidence most recent management advice in
business is the so-called "Trystorming" approach which advocates
failing fast, quick while trying many solutions. But "trystorming"
requires trying and failing many times, and such risk taking will work
best in society with a wide social net.
