Africa News: "'In 2021, when the presence of the private military
company Wagner was increasingly intrusive in [Central African
Republic], France considered that the conditions were no longer met
for us to continue working for the [CAR] armed forces,'.. commander of
French forces in Gabon, told AFP"

The Atlantic: "Boycott Bans Are an Assault on Free Speech.. America
began with boycotts. Angry about Britain’s tax raises, the historian
T. H. Breen writes, American colonists saw their refusal to purchase
British goods as a 'reflexive response to taxation without
representation'..

I think what’s really offensive about the anti-BDS laws in particular
is the way that they single out not even boycotts generally, but on
this one specific issue for special penalties—I think that really
gives the game away that the government is trying to suppress specific
viewpoints here,” Brian Hauss, an attorney for the ACLU, which
challenged the Arkansas law and several others like it, told me"

*Battlestar Galactica* was good scifi - it brought back some realism
back to the genre. It did away with "beam weapons", the ships were
shooting physical objects at eachother.. Ships were powered by a
*fuel*, something substantial, not "charged". The fuel was a material
called tylium, they were mining for it, it was a physical object
carried from one place to another - the most optimal way of carrying
energy.

NYT: "Inside the Global Race to Turn Water Into Fuel..

A consortium of energy companies led by BP plans to cover an expanse
of land eight times as large as New York City with as many as 1,743
wind turbines, each nearly as tall as the Empire State Building, along
with 10 million or so solar panels and more than a thousand miles of
access roads to connect them all. But none of the 26 gigawatts of
energy the site expects to produce, equivalent to a third of what
Australia’s grid currently requires, will go toward public
use. Instead, it will be used to manufacture a novel kind of
industrial fuel: green hydrogen. This patch of desert, more than 100
miles from the nearest town, sits next to the biggest problem that
green hydrogen could help solve: vast iron ore mines that are full of
machines powered by immense amounts of dirty fossil fuels. Three of
the world’s four biggest ore miners operate dozens of mines
here.Proponents hope green hydrogen will clean up not only mining but
other industries by replacing fossil fuel use in steel making,
shipping, cement and elsewhere..

Last year, government subsidies sped up action in the European Union,
India, Australia, the United States and elsewhere. The Inflation
Reduction Act, the Biden administration’s landmark climate
legislation, aims to drive the domestic cost of green hydrogen down to
a quarter of what it is now in less than a decade through tax
incentives and $9.5 billion in grants. 'We are about to jump from the
starting blocks,' said Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, who once led Germany’s
biggest renewable energy company and now runs BP’s gas and low-carbon
operations. 'I think hydrogen will grow even faster than wind and
solar have.'"
