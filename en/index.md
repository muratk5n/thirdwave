"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.

Furthermore, Earth’s lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.

Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"

Here's a simple rule - do not use lithium-ion tech.

This plant was seperate from the wildfires BTW, the shit just ignited,
and turned into hellfire.

Lithium-ion batteries likely contributed to the spread of LA
wildfires..  if they burn longer and almost impossible to put out,
they would contribute to the spread more than any other material.

VICE: "Burning EV Batteries Are Delaying LA Wildfire Clean-Up...
lithium-ion batteries.. have complicated the fight against LA
wildfires. When those batteries catch fire, they become a raging
inferno nearly impossible to put out. A Tesla-related car accident
back in 2018 is a tragic example of this. The car crashed, bursting
into flames and killing everyone inside. It took emergency responders
almost 300 gallons of water and foam to extinguish the fire. After
everyone thought the blaze was subdued, responders were loading the
Tesla for removal when the battery ignited again, entirely on its
own. The fires are so intense and difficult to combat that a common
tactic for battling them is to not battle them at all — just let them
burn until there’s nothing left.

Bloomberg: "Burning Teslas in LA Add to Toxic Mix Hindering Wildfire
Cleanup.. As the smoke clears from devastating Los Angeles wildfires,
efforts to clean up the affected areas are being complicated by
burnt-out electric and hybrid vehicles and home-battery storage
systems.

Lithium batteries from Tesla Inc., along with those from other
carmakers, have added to the mix of toxic materials requiring
specialized removal in the wake of the fires, delaying the fire
victims’ return to their properties.

'A lot of the cars in the evacuation area were lithium batteries,'
said Jacqui Irwin, a state assembly member representing the Pacific
Palisades, one of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the fires. 'We’ve
heard from firefighters that those lithium batteries burned fires near
homes – like those with power walls – for much longer.'.. Fires in
lithium batteries can require large amounts of water to put out"

The National: "In a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the
ICJ saying that Palestinians’ right to be protected from genocide
faced a 'plausible' risk from Israel, Amnesty International said the
UK Government had 'contributed to Israel’s impunity and risked British
complicity in serious crimes against international law'"
