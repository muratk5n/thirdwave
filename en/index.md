China Hydrogen Bulletin: "China now arguably controls world
electrolyzer manufacturing capacities, especially alkaline
electrolyzers, with over 50 per cent global nominal capacities located
in China by the end of 2023.. China will have over 40GW electrolyzer
production capacity by the end of 2024, which alone far exceeds
foreseeable global demand of around 10GW in 2025. However, latest
developments shows that Chinese electrolyzer producers didn’t halt
their expanding pace-at least five companies have announced
inauguration of new plants or beginning of construction of GW scale
production facilities just within first two months of 2024. Through
these cases, we may realize that even the most aggressive forecasts by
world leading consultancies may underestimate the capacity building of
China’s electrolyzer sector"

It makes sense for Disney to go Woke, they are deeply embedded in
complex. They need to gaslight, that means taking part in the Woke
debate. They are essentially pursuing this non-issue to escape the
pitchforks.

Here is [Disney](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/wccbwl1qtxq2osfuarfng/disney_theyrule1.gif?rlkey=4xpmucsf7clyhvk6tu1qa1o9u&raw=1).
With a little browsing I found two connections already.

There are some interesting connections there... You can play a version
of Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon with this data, start with one
conglomerate and find out how many board member connections it takes
to reach another.

[They Rule](https://theyrule.net) is an interactive visualization of
the interlocking directories of the largest US companies. It shows
that 87 of the top 100 US companies in 2021 were connected through
shared directors on their boards... A few companies control much of
the economy and oligopolies exert control in nearly every sector of
the economy. The people who oversee these companies swap on and off
the boards from one company to another, and in and out of government
positions. These people run the most powerful institutions on the
planet, and we have almost no say in who they are"

Kurt Andersen: "In the 1960s and ’70s, Daniel Moynihan had been
pigeonholed as a moderate or a conservative, but as a U.S. senator
during the 1990s, when the rest of his party went Republicanesque on
the political economy, Moynihan was a kind of heroic last left-winger
standing...

At the start of his presidency, Clinton tried to legislate an
expansion of the private U.S. health insurance system to make it cover
more people. 'Mr. Clinton and his allies,' a Times analysis explained
in 1994, 'were trying hard to redefine the Democratic Party away from
traditionally liberal approaches to domestic policy; they were almost
inevitably drawn to the ideas of managed competition.  Though still
largely theoretical, the concept relies on market forces, not
government, to hold down costs and expand access to health insurance.'
That is, Clinton tried and failed to pass a version of Obamacare
sixteen years before Obama succeeded..

[Moynihan said of Clintoncare back then] 'He hated unnecessary
government complexity' and the Clinton plan.. was complex and hard to
explain (as Obamacare would be as well). Also, Moynihan 'could see the
[so-called reform] policies' proposed by Clinton would 'not perform as
promised'"

.. When Congress says we can’t afford universal healthcare, they are
saying, 'We can’t afford to not make the insurance companies money
because they fund our campaigns'"
