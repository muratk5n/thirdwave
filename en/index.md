Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Finnish former commando fighting the generic baddie "Nazis" but the
origin story is key, he was wronged by Russia Russia Russia.

Finland is of course an RU border country who just recently became a
NATO member. In the beginning of the movie they even show the Finnish
hero mining for gold, he is practically an American for god's sake!
Identify with that man and his nation, please! We beg you!

One day maybe the Anglo will stir some shit up btw FN/RU too and the
then Fin leader will go around inspired by this movie ask for hardware
for war he could easily avoid.

Regulation, fine. But we need to realize it is because the stuff isn't
smart, precisely the opposite, it is too freaking stupid, parrot-like
