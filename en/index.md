Butler: "[from a speech before the American Legion which made the
papers]. I spent thirty-three years and four months in active military
service, and during that period I spent most of my time being a
high-class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the
bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I
helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. I
helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown
Brothers in 1902–1912. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico
safe for American oil interests in 1914. I brought light to the
Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped
make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to
collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central
American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. In China in 1927 I
helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking
back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he
could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on
three continents"

a Marine Expeditionary Force during the late 1920s, named a major
general later. He is one of the few people who have been twice awarded
the Medal of Honor, received the Marine Corps Brevet Medal, the
highest Marine decoration at the time for officers. He figured out
what was going on however, wrote about it. His book *War Is a Racket*
was republished recently, its intro written by Jesse Ventura.
