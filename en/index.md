Andersen: "[After 80s] The probability that elected Democrats would
tend to increase my taxes wasn’t a reason I voted for them, but my
indifference to the financial hit.. felt virtuous, low-end noblesse
oblige. However, even after the right got its way on the political
economy, many people like me weren’t viscerally, actively skeptical of
business or Wall Street either... Affluent college-educated people,
Democrats as well as Republicans, began using the phrase 'socially
liberal but fiscally conservative' to describe their politics, which
meant low taxes in return for tolerance of.. *whatever*, as long it
didn’t cost affluent people anything. It was a libertarianism lite
that kept everything nice and clubbable"

Govs debating taxes that only apply to working people remind me
of the [Streetlight Effect](https://axispraxis.wordpress.com/2016/03/24/the-streetlight-effect-a-metaphor-for-knowledge-and-ignorance/),
the old Sufi parable where the mystic was looking for his keys under
the streetlight because "that's where his eyes could see". Same for
govs, they can't touch, look for the solutions that even remotely
bother the wealthy, so they keep seeking solutions where they are
allowed - around taxes that effect working people.

New Statesman: "Britain’s great tax con.. The UK’s tax system
entrenches inequality, stymies growth, and rewards a few at the
expense of the many... Labour will soon face an inescapable choice. In
order to spend money in government the party will need to raise
it... shift the tax burden away from labour and on to capital, away
from work and on to wealth. An agenda is coalescing in policy circles
around a set of major tax changes that could spur growth, cut taxes
for most people"

It's true.. 

"@burgerdrome@aus.social

I learned today that just a few hours before announcing the (still
extant) embargo on Cuba, JFK sent out his head of press to make a
last-minute bulk purchase of literally more than 1,000 Cuban cigars
for his personal collection, because he couldn't stand to be without
the things that he insisted nobody else should be allowed to
have. Truly an absolute dogshit man"

Increasing innovation is not enough to provide a target for all the
wealth sloshing around in the system. There is just too much money
held by too few, and many will chose to park it in assets rather than
risk it on innovation. Large asset holders need to lose some of their
money. This is win-lose situation, somebody needs to lose, and it can't
be the regular people.

BTW the $5 trillion he mentions there now became 45 trillion
