404 Media: "Major Health Insurance Companies Take Down Leadership
Pages Following Murder of United Healthcare CEO"

ProPublica: "[2024/02] UnitedHealthcare Tried to Deny Coverage to a
Chronically Ill Patient. He Fought Back, Exposing the Insurer’s Inner
Workings...  More than 200 million Americans are covered by private
health insurance. But data from state and federal regulators shows
that insurers reject about 1 in 7 claims for treatment. Many people,
faced with fighting insurance companies, simply give up: One study
found that Americans file formal appeals on only 0.1% of claims denied
by insurers under the Affordable Care Act"

"@rusty@piaille.fr

Yesterday, an American billionaire was shot dead in the middle of New
York. This man was the CEO of a health insurance company
[UnitedHealthcare], and he held the record for the number of denials
of reimbursement. The worst executive in American health insurance.

And so, Americans don't sympathize. This morning I'm inundated with
jokes about an assassination, it's really strange"

That's not funny, my beloved grandma was an insurance CEO who made
$10-20 million per year"
