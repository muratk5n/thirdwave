Inside the Games: "Beijing 2022 hydrogen buses prove popular in
Zhangjiakou due to ability to start in cold weather..  Nearly a year
after the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, the hydrogen-powered
buses have become the preferred mode of public transport in
Zhangjiakou"

Global Times: "[2022/02] Beijing 2022 sees largest use of
hydrogen-powered vehicles in Olympic history"

Quick reminder the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics transport was
*entirely* hydrogen-driven, CH used the occasion to showcase the tech,
and it worked brilliantly. A lot of corporate battery-brain dipshit
media missed this aspect of the games.

Techdirt: "'The Messenger' launched to great fanfare... The brainchild
of former The Hill owner Jimmy Finkelstein, the outlet launched with
$50 million in backing and a lot of chatter about how it was going to
revolutionize U.S. journalism...

The news outlet didn’t even last a year...

The Messenger’s coverage generally suffered from what NYU journalism
professor Jay Rosen calls the “view from nowhere,” or a sort of timid,
pseudo-objectivity that fails to prioritize the sole function of
journalism: getting to the actual truth.

Many Messenger reporters who thought they were being hired to do real
reporting had complained for much of the last year about how they were
being forced to suddenly chase ad impressions by crafting low-quality
aggregated engagement bait more akin to infotainment than journalism.

Such journalism is a direct reflection of millionaire or billionaire
media owners who don’t want to offend sources, advertisers, or event
sponsors with bold, truth-telling journalism that has actual teeth. So
what you get instead is a sort of journalism simulacrum that fails to
critique wealth, corruption, or power with any real consistency, since
the wealthy and powerful owners very obviously don’t want that"

"Real estate is a huge force in New York’s economy.. Many of these
real estate interests hide their ownership information; in Manhattan,
37 percent of the 41,000 total properties are owned by secretive
limited liability companies.. These property owners are contributing
to a housing crisis. The state ranks in the top five of highest
average home prices and has a severe housing shortage, pushing up
rents and rates of homelessness. This scarcity in housing is only
exacerbated by the fact that huge financial institutions are buying up
single-family homes and apartment buildings across the country"

---

*The Lever* reports the NY state's LLC Transparency Act, "which was
designed to crack down on anonymous shell companies operating in New
York, required limited liability companies to report their owners’
identifying information to an online database" was watered down. The
changes mean "information about the shadowy corporate landlords that
control a wide swath of Manhattan real estate remains inaccessible to
the public".

Reading the memoir of Wendell Potter, a former PR exec at Cigna
Healthcare, for-profit health insurance corp, learned about him from a
Status Coup article detailing how Dems are captured by for-profit
interests. The book is an eye opener, highly recommended. WP was one
of the nation's top PR execs whose sole job was killing public
healthcare initiatives like Medicare-for-All.

TB2 is also too expensive.. that's why afaik focus recently shifted to
FPV drones for both sides. TB2 is rarely used these days by UA.

Breaking Defense: "\#UA \#RU Cheap flying robots, like the Chinese DJI
Mavic, with even high-end models costing just a couple thousand
dollars, can pinpoint targets for artillery, alert troops to lurking
ambushes, drop improvised bombs like a flying IED.. Bayraktar TB2 are
just too big and fly too high, making them easy prey for radar-guided
anti-aircraft weapons that cannot spot the smaller, lower-flying
quadcopters"

"@wilbr@glitch.social

What does it say about the health of our society that people are
c*nsoring their own words and using random unique invented synonyms on
social media (that we're supposed to pick up on as readers) not
because of government reprisal but because The Algorithm will
associate you with negativity and straight up disappear you from the
social space otherwise?"

Monbiot, *The Guardian*: "Peaceful environmental campaigners are being
held on bail for up to two years, subjected to electronic tags, GPS
tracking and curfews, and deprived of their social lives and political
rights. This is one of many examples of process as punishment. Even
before you have been tried, let alone found guilty, your life is
shredded..  In a world built by plutocrats, the powerful are protected
while vengeful laws silence their critics"

All that Houthi retaliation, for nothing.. strategically that
is... Benjamins keep flowing.

Reuters: "Six US-backed Kurdish fighters killed in drone attack on US
base in Syria"

Forbes: "Five hundred tanks. More than 600 fighting vehicles. Hundreds
of howitzers. Forty thousand troops. According to Ukraine’s eastern
command, Russia has assembled a huge field army in eastern Ukraine
opposite the free Ukrainian city of Kupyansk"
