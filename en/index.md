have shown that the Taliban is storing the river's water behind its
dams, such as the Kamal Khan Dam, when Iran's southeastern Sistan and
Baluchestan province bordering Afghanistan was hit by drought.. He
urged the Taliban to respect Iran's water rights from the Helmand
River under a 1973 treaty between the two countries, which entitles
Iran to receive 820 million cubic meters of water from the river per
year.

He added that in addition to the dams built along the Helmand River in
the past, the Taliban has constructed new ones to 'prevent the river's
water from running into Iran.'. The Iranian Space Agency spokesman
said last week satellite photos showed that the Taliban have altered
the river's route in order to prevent it from reaching Iran"
