Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Modern US liberalism can get delusional; it always had a subjective,
un-scientific bent, bizarre ideas about the self. Truly mambo-jambo
stuff, "new age", like "believing you can be, at an instant, however
you label yourself to be". How the flap can you will yourself to be a
man, or woman when you aren't? In own head fine but why inflict that
delusion on others?

Good law.

‘first-of-its-kind’ MHx solid-state hydrogen storage and distribution
product and features magnesium-based alloy.

Hydrexia claims it can significantly enhance transportation safety and
distance, while reducing transportation cost. It has a large
solid-state hydrogen storage capacity of one tonne and hydrogen
storage density of 6.4%.

It offers low operating pressures of under 12 bar and high hydrogen
purity at 99.999% along with a lifetime of 3,000 cycles without
performance reduction

JFK wasn't buttonholed into anything for the Bay of Pigs; he modified
parts of the plan (badly), and kept managing it (badly) all the way
through its miserable end. Noone likes their uncle to be an
incompetent dumbass, sadly, this was the case.

CH attack was likely for more US econ help. Xiao wanted to give
Vietnam a visible spanking, a country which had only six years ago
managed to repel the Americans, to show that "see I'm hitting your
former enemy, also containing your Cold War opposition, therefore I'm
your friend".

From *Deng Xiaoping's Long War*: "[Most scholars] do not elucidate why
Deng [Xiaoping] was so eager to inform the Carter administration of
Beijing’s decision to attack Vietnam, something that normally would
only have happened between two closely allied countries..

China’s market-­oriented economic reforms also reinforced the
importance of pragmatic power politics to Chinese strategic
thinking. Deng staked the success of economic reform on Western
technology and foreign investment, particularly from America. Deng’s
acceptance of U.S. terms during the establishment of diplomatic
relations between the two countries in mid-­December 1978 was crucial
in achieving these two strategic objectives both externally and
internally... China’s decision to launch a punitive war against
Vietnam was intended to display Beijing’s usefulness in countering
Soviet expansionism. In Deng’s own words, China was 'a reliable
friend,' and it therefore deserved Western economic and technological
assistance"

Everyone knows about US Vietnam War which ended in 1973. Most do not
know however China's 1979 war with them.

I was watching a docu, an RFK granddaugter was on, looked her up
apparently one spring got on a canoe, pulled into some turbulence, got
sucked in - bitch died. It's like a joke.

But with a Kennedy you never know - he could just fall off the chair
one day, hit his head and die

Watched the \#JFKJr speech, sounded almost cogent, not bad for a
Kennedy. Except for the lockdown stuff the rest was ok on regulatory
capture, corporations, Ukraine, food stamp cuts, hits the right
notes. Can be a viable threat for JB. After Trump, lewd scandal stuff
matters less, he can make a play for the working class, Reps through
that vax business, and by being an "irregular politician".

Macron: "[04/13] Europeans cannot resolve the crisis in Ukraine; how
can we credibly say on Taiwan, watch out, if you do something wrong,
we will be there?"

Macron: "[04/13] Europe cannot blindly follow the United States’ lead
and should avoid getting dragged into crises that are not our own."
