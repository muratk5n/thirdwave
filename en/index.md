"@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social

Copilot’s front page on the app today suggests I ask 'tell me a fact'.

I did.. the first one is 'Banging your head against a wall burns 150
calories', which links to a Reddit thread, which links to an article,
from a 'contributor', which mentions it in the headline then has no
citation or mentions it again"

It is hilarious how US plutocrats, and their judiciary and
legistlative tools tied money into a sacred US concept, freedom /
freedom of speech. By giving money, you are exercising your right to
speech, hence limitless campaign donations must be
protected. Brilliant how they identified and tacked on that
concept... If there was another sacred anything, they'd have used that
too... If cows were sacred, it would be money = cow. "How could you be
against money, it is the sacred!" Sacred as in cow, ostensibly.

@threads. My hope is that Threads can inspire ideas that bring people
together, and this amazing community continues to grow. Thank you for
investing your time and giving feedback that makes the place better
for everyone"
