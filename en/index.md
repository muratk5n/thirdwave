- Demonstrated self-driving cars don't work. Cruise no longer operates
  in California

- A lot of guerilla infrastructure, including taking inspiration from

The Baltic Times: Six gas transmission operators develop the
cross-border hydrogen transmission infrastructure from Finland through
Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland to Germany, namely
the Nordic-Baltic Hydrogen Corridor. The goal of the project is to
create the connection between green energy production regions in
Northern Europe with the main consumption centres in Central
Europe. This project is expected to be implemented by 2030.

the same temperature right? I could not double the temperature by
cutting the cake into two. The commentary is bizarre.

Sounds baseless
