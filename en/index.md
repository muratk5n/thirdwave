NPR: "[2013] There's a saying in Mexico: *Sin maiz, no hay pais*: no
corn, no country. Mexico is where corn originated, and it's the food
staple most people depend on. It's what Antonio Pena grew on his
family farm in Guanajuato in Central Mexico...

The Mexican government used to subsidize corn. It kept the crop price
high so small farmers could stay in business. And it kept tortilla
prices low so poor people could eat. When NAFTA took effect two
decades ago, the trade agreement phased out tariffs in order to lower
costs and encourage investment between the U.S., Canada and
Mexico. The Mexican government ended its corn subsidy..

Seventy-five thousand Iowa farmers grew twice as much corn as three
million Mexican farmers at half the cost. U.S. corn flooded Mexico. An
estimated two million Mexican farm workers in general left the
countryside for big cities. Antonio Pena was one of them... Then, like
millions more Mexicans, he crossed illegally into the U.S."

Ledbetter, *Unwarranted Influence*: "The last years of [Ike's]
presidency were marked by deep, often bitter conflicts with Congress
over the military and national security... These conflicts came to a
head in the fall of 1957, with the one-two punch of the Soviet Sputnik
launch and the near-simultaneous release of a report arguing that the
United States would soon fall behind the Soviets in the production of
atomic weapons...

The launch of the Sputnik satellite on October 4, 1957, hit the
Eisenhower White House like a targeted missile. Whether it represented
a scientific breakthrough for the Soviet Union is a matter that can
still be debated. But as a public relations coup, it unsettled the
administration more than any other event... 

While the public was focused on the two Sputnik launches, Washington’s
elite was arguably more devastated by the release of an exceptionally
well-timed panel study — delivered four days after the second Sputnik
orbit — that appeared to show the Soviet military threat was even
greater than the administration thought. Entitled 'Deterrence &
Survival in the Nuclear Age,' it was known informally as the Gaither
Report, after its panel chairman, H. Rowan Gaither of the RAND
Corporation. The report —classified top secret— cited 'spectacular
progress' in Soviet military development after World War II.  The
Soviets, the authors claimed, had enough fissionable material for
fifteen hundred atomic weapons and had 'probably surpassed' the United
States in the production of nuclear-tipped intercontinental
missiles. They proposed a massive military spending program that
would...  match the alleged Soviet offensive capabilities..

The period following the Sputnik-Gaither crisis demonstrates
Eisenhower’s military-industrial-complex critique in its early
stages. [W]ho was behind the faulty intelligence and calls for
military buildup in the Gaither Report? The leadership consisted of
known and trusted Eisenhower advisors, but there could be no hiding
the fact that the billions in increased military spending called for
by the panel would benefit many of the very people making the
recommendations. Two of the report’s principal directors were Robert
C. Sprague, who headed his own business of military electronics, and
William C. Foster of the Olin-Mathiesen Chemical Company, a producer
of gunpowder and ammunition"
