"Second French Plan for Open Science.. Open science refers to the
unhindered dissemination of results, methods and products from
scientific research. It draws on the opportunity provided by recent
digital progress to develop open access to publications and – as much
as possible – data, source code and research methods... The French
Plan for Open Science has provided France with a coherent and dynamic
policy in the field of open science. It was announced in 2018 by the
Minister of Higher Education, Research and Innovation, Frédérique
Vidal, and is coordinated by the Committee for Open Science, which
brings together the Ministry, the universities and research performing
organizations and the scientific community. Substantial progress has
been made in the three years since this policy was introduced. The
percentage of open access scientific publications in France has risen
from 41% to 56%"

Paper: "Replacing traditional journals with a more modern solution is
not a new idea. Here, we propose ways to overcome the social dilemma
underlying the decades of inaction. Any solution needs to not only
resolve the current problems but also be capable of preventing
takeover by corporations: it needs to replace traditional journals
with a decentralized, resilient, evolvable network that is
interconnected by open standards and open-source norms under the
governance of the scholarly community."

250 bucks.. let's be nice now.. dont wanna bankrupt these "value creators"
they give so much to society

Gizmodo: "Earlier in the week, NBCUniversal drew controversy when it
suddenly up and pruned a bunch of shade trees in front of its lot. Up
until then, those trees were being used by striking writers and actors
as shade during their picketing, because it’s been really hot in Los
Angeles lately. To see them cut down felt like a very deliberate move
against picketers, even as Universal insisted it was nothing more than
a not-so-happy coincidence... LA’s City Controller Kenneth
Mejia.. said that StreetsLA would issue a fine of $250 to the
corporation for the violation of cutting trees without a city permit"

But even when they agreed on 'freedoms', anti-gov views, neither side
liked what those freedoms would entail, unleash on the other side. The
economic right could not stand the socially permissive ways of the
cultural left, who in turn could not stand some freedoms the right
practiced such as guns, and the lax atitude towards the
environment. But that was okay - that dislike could subtitute for
politics now - everyone could argue until they were blue in the face
that never amounted to much change since the 'superstructure'
underneath that allowed it was set in stone. But argument, upon
argument, hack against hack were piled on.. It made a festive
party. In the process due to natural cycles there would be ups and
downs, some ppl would drop out of office, some get in, some would get
awarded, some get rich, even minorities would get to 'represent'..  it
could look like forward momentum, advance, for a while it looked like
things were getting better (but they were not)

What do you get as the result of economic right's [grand
bargain](2023/06/evil-geniuses.html#bargain) with cultural left? The
Woke ideology. The masses were permitted to increase their
"self-expressive urges" (some took it to its natural conclusion and
became Woke) capitalists in return were also unshackled in their own
ways and formed today's business class, some bought guns. They are
different sides of the same coin.

Politico: "There was understandable glee in Kyiv when news broke that
the Kremlin was turning on the self-styled Club of Angry Patriots —
the ultranationalists.. But given the bigger picture, the excitement
may prove premature... despite these sackings and arrests, Russia’s
defenses are holding as Ukraine’s counteroffensive continues to make
disappointing progress. After nearly two months of fighting, Ukraine’s
made no significant breakthrough in the south, where Kyiv had hoped to
see more progress in its bid to sever the so-called land bridge
connecting the annexed Crimean isthmus and southern Ukrainian
territories occupied by Russian forces. Moreover, Russia has launched
its own counteroffensive further north around Kupyansk and Kreminna"
