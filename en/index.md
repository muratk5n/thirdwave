the second-storey balcony to escape"

Two vloggers did it, along with pickles, worked out for them

Dehydrating smoked meat.. now that's an idea

A previous share on the movie *Cobra* made a paralel to the "Scorpion
Unit" of Memphis, to that special team, outsider, specialized cop
mentality, "the heros who do what others cannot", so forth..
Not picking on Stallone or that particular movie, others from that era
had similar movies, here's an Ahnuld movie, tough guy [tearing it up](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1j6A1QsiCkng1TupKnVUaiFghrS1R8wmM),
there are drugged out people.. Very Reaganesque.

US pro wrestling resembles stunt work.. it's like bunch of stunt
actors wanting to be movie stars. The fighting is likely how stunt
actors fight except there are no camera tricks to gloss over the
make-play parts - punch that doesn't connect, fall that doesn't look
real.. Then wrestling is like theater form of Holywood movie action.

Docker software allows packing of code that needs run together in a
neat package, all code, utilities, even the OS itself. From AWS: "
Similar to how a virtual machine virtualizes (removes the need to
directly manage) server hardware, containers virtualize the operating
system of a server"

OSS Programmer: "Docker is deleting Open Source organisations..
Yesterday, Docker sent an email to any Docker Hub user
who had created an "organisation", telling them their account will be
deleted including all images, if they do not upgrade to a paid team
plan...

Docker was born in Open Source. We the community were their king
makers, and now that they're turning over significant revenue, they
are only too ready to forget their roots"

Smitsonian Magazine: "[In Europe] Germany started testing the world’s
first hydrogen-powered passenger trains in 2018, going on to roll out
a fleet in 2022. The German Coradia iLint trains, also made by Alstom,
can reach speeds of 140 miles per hour. A single tank of hydrogen can
last for more that 600 miles. Germany’s trains are a 'model for the
rest of the world' and 'a milestone on the road to climate neutrality
in the transport sector,' said Stephan Weil, president of Lower
Saxony"

Smitsonian Magazine: "This summer, North America’s first zero-emission
train will start running in Canada. The hydrogen-powered Train de
Charlevoix will run a 90-minute route between ​​Parc de la
Chute-Montmorency, the site of an almost 300-foot waterfall located
just outside of Québec City"

PSG was bought in 2011 apparently when Qatar was feelin' good, on top
of the world, before it got bitchslapped back to its place, woke up to
reality started smelling coffee... Reality bites: you can't be a
leader with tiny-ass landmass, little population, and no symbolic
presence in the Islamic world to speak of (a "museum" designed by
I.M. Pei doesn't count).

---

Yo the French team was *on their ass*, even with all that dubious shit
they still could've taken the Cup.

---

Aah it makes even more sense now; Messi's pro team PSG is owned by
Qatar, that's likely why FIFA/Qatar cheated in the final WC game to
have Argentina win with Messi its captain.
