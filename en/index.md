Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Euractiv: "France asks [Azerbaijan] to restore ‘unhindered’ movement on vital corridor"

But of course they do

Al-Monitor: "[2023/03] Israel exports arms to Azerbaijan as tensions
soar with Armenia"

Where is the good ol' genocide victim symphaty when you need it eh?
Israel gets it, forgiveness in all kinds of world affairs, why not
Armenia?

Aw darn - they have relations with Russia, that's the problem. In that
case your victimization counts less.. Israel's matters more because
they are on the *right side*, the tip of the spear for "Anglo designs"
in the region. We hyperventilate about theirs, not about Armenia bcz
they are not US', Britain's bitch.

It was at the Lachin Corridor

Reuters: "Azerbaijan said it had established a checkpoint on the road
leading to Karabakh, a step it said was essential due to what it cast
as Armenia's use of the road to transport weapons"

A lot of ppl in analytics do not seem to have mastered the dark arts
of incremental processing; Do not bring *da entire* input file in
memory, keep *da entire* output in memory before writing it to file,
read piecemeal, write piecemeal, while keeping only the bare minimum,
bare essentials in RAM. A lot of algorithms can be coded this way.

"@QasimRashid@mastodon.social

A quick history lesson. From 1940-1980:

•Wealthiest paid 70-94% marginal tax

•0 of them went broke from taxation

•0 of them left USA

•All remained exceedingly wealthy

•Manufacturing boomed

•The middle class was 62% of US economy (It's now 40% post 'trickle
 down scamenomics)"
