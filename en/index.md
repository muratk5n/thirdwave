Energy & Sustainable World: "[T]here are innovations on the horizon
that will make large-scale production of hydrogen much more
feasible. One such innovation is called Nanotubes. These tiny tubes
can store large amounts of hydrogen gas at room temperature...

Another innovation involves attaching some nanoparticles (i.e., tiny
particles) to some plastics; this makes them hydrophobic, which means
they won't absorb any water or moisture. When these hydrophobic
plastics are in contact with water, they release their stored hydrogen
gas (H2) and then change back into their hydrophilic state"
