Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

[BigThink](https://bigthink.com/hard-science/how-to-colonize-venus/):
"While [Venus and Mars] may not seem alike at first blush,
Venus is quite similar to Earth compared to other planets in our solar
system. So much so, the Morning Star is sometimes called Earth’s
'sister planet'. Its gravity is 90% as strong as Earth’s, compared to
Mars’ ~38%, meaning that our muscles won’t atrophy, and our bones
won’t decalcify as they do in low-gravity environments"
