Financial Post: "VW lays off workers at key EV factory over cratering
demand"

"In *The EV Transition Explained* (published by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers), Robert Charette reports that
charging an electrical vehicle (EV) can overheat a transformer—and
shorten its typically 30-to-40-year lifespan to three
years. (Transformers reduce electricity’s voltage when it’s
transmitted from a substation to a residence or business; above-ground
transformers look like trash cans mounted on utility poles.) When I
shared Charette’s report with an LA friend, he told me that the
underground transformer 50 feet from his house exploded last April on
a Saturday morning—a time he considered low-demand for electricity.

'Is it low-demand,' I wondered, 'if a handful of neighbors charge
their vehicles Friday night?'..

Different batteries have different constructs and chemistry. Tesla
batteries are held together by 'an almost indestructible polyurethane
cement.' Nissan’s Leaf battery can take two hours to
dismantle. Recycling batteries can release toxins and pose fire
hazards. By 2035, we’ll have 150 million unusable, toxic EV batteries"

"I’ve read about lithium extraction’s prodigious water use in
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Tibet—and at the U.S.’s first lithium mine,
in Silver Peak, Nevada. In 2017, research led me to Lithium Americas
Corporation’s (LAC’s) plan to turn part of the Great Basin—a
biodiverse and exquisite ecosystem between Boise and Reno known as
Thacker Pass—into an industrial extraction zone stretching over more
than 17,000 acres. Thacker Pass holds the U.S.’s largest known lithium
deposits. The corporation’s open pit alone would cover two square
miles in the mine’s first stage, and it could triple in size. Tailings
piles, processing facilities and treatments ponds would sprawl across
yet more land. The mine would burn 11,000 gallons of diesel fuel per
day and rely on more than 75 semi-truck loads of sulfur (oil refinery
waste) to process the ore. It would consume and pollute more than 1.5
billion gallons of water per year, dropping water tables and
potentially drying out fourteen springs"

Algorithm Watch: "Automated navigation systems are still wreaking
havoc on small towns’ streets.. Apps like Google and Waze are
redirecting traffic to secondary roads that are not equipped to handle
the traffic, disrupting their infrastructure. Small cities have little
capacity to change this"

Businessline: "The India-Middle East-Europe Corridor rail-sea link
will provide strategic, economic gains for India and member
nations.. The expected cost of the proposed corridor will be $20
billion on laying a dedicated rail network, contiguously supported by
state of art optical fibre network and a hydrogen pipeline.

Initially, the existing UAE-Saudi-Amman rail network with construction
of additional 300 km of network connecting Amman with port Haifa,
Israel will be operationalised. As the UAE foresee rich business
dividends from this project, it is willing to finance the remaining
stretch of 300 km on a priority basis. The network will support the
seamless movement of goods under a digital and single trade document,
harmonised transport rules and will be far cheaper operationally than
the Suez Canal route, considering its high charges for vessel towing,
tug-boat services, pilotage,transit fee etc"
