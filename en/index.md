"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.

Furthermore, Earth’s lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.

Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"

\#JacobBarandes \#QM

The comments below are an outgrowth of JB's research who was able to
show QM is merely a reflection, a projection of physical models based
on "configuration spaces combined with stochastic dynamics". The
system evolves based on non-Markovian stochastic process, during
measurement the experimenter loses something during the transition
which results in the funky results, that are attributed to the
"unexplainable weirdness" of quantum mechanics.

Other gems in the video, wave functions (of QM) are not real. They
have no physical existence in reality. Ergo I conclude any talk about
their "collapse" and follow up thought experiments therein would not
be scientific.

Hossein-Zadeh: "Frightened by the specter of peace and/or peace
dividends [after the fall of the Berlin Wall], beneficiaries of
military spending frantically sought to invent and substitute 'new
threats' for the 'communist threat' of the Cold War era, thereby
preempting the realization of peace dividends.

In pursuit of this goal, beneficiaries of war and militarism found a
strong, well-established network of politically savvy allies: radical
Zionist proponents of 'greater Israel.' Because the interests of these
two powerful groups converged over fomenting war and political
convulsion in the Middle East, an ominously potent alliance was forged
between them— ominous, because the mighty U.S. war machine was now
supplemented by the almost unrivaled public relations capabilities of
the hard-line pro-Israel lobby in the United States. The alliance is
unofficial and de facto; it is subtly forged through an elaborate
network of powerful militaristic think tanks"

---

Hossein-Zadeh: "[2006] U.S. policy makers in the Middle East would go
along with the demands of the radical Zionist lobby only if such
demands also tend to serve the special interests that those policy
makers represent or serve — not necessarily the interests of the
American people, or collective U.S. 'national interests' in
general. The fact that, as pointed out earlier, U.S. foreign policy
during the Cold War era was less accommodating to the territorial
desires of militant Zionism than in the post–Cold War period is an
indication of this point. Another corroborating indication of the
point is that as the military-industrial complex has been gaining more
and more influence over U.S. foreign policy, that policy has,
accordingly, been more and more geared to the wishes of hard-line
Zionism because, as has been frequently pointed out in this chapter,
the interests of the U.S.  military establishment converge with those
of militant Zionism over war and political convulsion in the Middle
East"

Syria is another case in point. They had tussles w Israel, bcz they
are near (Israel causes problems to all who is near), and for the same
reason Syria along the way became mostly pacified and it acted the
least on Palestine issues, would jump, even until recently, at any
chance to be on good terms with Israel.

---

The guys near Palestine, Jordan, Egypt also happen to have,
historically, more conflicts w/ Israel, bcz of that very reason, they
were near Israel. The private military-industrial-Likud complex used
more arm twisting on them compared to the rest, bcz they had more of a
potential to fight Israel.

Iran came into the picture later, after the near "threat" subsided,
but the complex needed military spending, that's when Iran became
"more evil".

---

Thats true but half the story (also a bit unfair).

"The further you are from Palestine, the more you cheer for the
Palestinian cause"

---

If US support for Israel was "strategic" then why were two famous
presidents before Truman were against it? Eisenhower and FDR.

---

Truman is skooling the viewer on how it's done. Take it from the pro,
the first leader to genocide others via nuclear bomb. Ethnic Cleansing
101. Watch and learn.
