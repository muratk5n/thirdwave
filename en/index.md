MIC influence and its control on USG is not a conspiracy theory. When
HP (a company in the lower rungs of the hierarchy btw) has two people
killed that were a nuisance to it in the same day, they are *letting
you know* they are the ones who did it. They are sticking it in your
eye. Yelling it in your ear with a megaphone. They want it to be
known, bcz they want to be seen and feared. They have the power.

Ledbetter, *Unwarrented Influence*: "The Iraq war has highlighted
issues of military accountability, and, as in previous wars, the
perception that the military acts with impunity has fed a sense of an
MIC exercising unwarranted influence. The conduct of U.S. troops and
contractors in Iraq— from administration-approved torture to instances
of rape and murder of civilians—are deeply disturbing, and while in
many cases individuals have been convicted, the frequency of abuse
suggests systemic flaws in the conduct of the war and in the military
culture. Such abuses are common during wartime.. but the concerns have
been heightened by the unprecedented number of private contractors,
whose growing influence in military and foreign policy circles has
caused some to label them “the fourth branch of government"
