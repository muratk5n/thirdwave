A correct, already unified theory would have been settled on by now if
Eurasia remained the center of science. US stewardship is the prime
culprit in the deadlock we find ourselves in.

The Albert quote below fittingly became huge in America after he
arrived there because it suited to the culture code of the land, one
they attached themselves - DREAM. But after decades of "imaginative"
and dreamy shit where are we?  Nowhere. Two fundamental theories
cannot be reconciled, unification attempts failed and failed even
after mammoth efforts expanded, including Albert's. Clearly imagination
is not the most important factor.

Not true. Knowledge is more important than imagination. If we assign
weights I'd say 90% knowledge 10% imagination.

We also need to ask the question "what kind of imagination?". We need
the type of imagination that is straightforward, internally
consistent, and has a certain craft attached to it that makes it a
solid base for what's to follow. Space-time could be wildly
imaginative but is not crafty, incorrect, essentially a weak idea.

Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge"

Surah Al-Anfal: "They planned, but Allah also planned. And Allah is
the best of planners."

The moneyed class, the private complex does not have to congregate
anywhere, secretly scheme about stuff.. They are organized like
al-Qaida, there are seperate, independent cells which are loosely tied
together via ideology. This is how they do economic terrorism.  To
fight it the oppo must fight all the cells, along with the ideology
itself.

George Carlin: "You don't need a formal conspiracy when interests
converge"

Ukraine before the war was an oligarch-controlled, corrupt country led
by the US proconsul Nuland where elections had become a mere
show. Historically we also know US overthrew democracies via
coups.. It seems as the United States is the real threat to democracy.

NST: "GCC reassure Tehran of neutrality in Iran-Israel conflict"

---

Politico: "US officials quietly backed Israel’s military push against
Hezbollah"

---

TASS: "If US moves to resume nuclear tests, Moscow will respond in
kind — Russian diplomat"

---

TASS: "Japan maintains the course toward solving the territorial
dispute and signing a peace treaty with Russia, despite difficulties
in the Japanese-Russian relationship, Japan’s new Prime Minister
Shigeru Ishiba said, delivering his first keynote speech in
parliament"
