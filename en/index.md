Fisk: "Sloppy use of language was also one of the most dangerous
aspects of successive American 'peace' accords. Clinton was good on
cliché and rhetoric but.. lazy when it came to points of
detail. Despite all the handshakes and platitudes at Wye, for example,
both Palestinians and Israelis went home with diametrically opposite
ideas of what had been achieved. Netanyahu was able to assure Jewish
colonists that there would be no Palestinian state, while Arafat’s men
could persuade their few remaining supporters that another Israeli
withdrawal would be another step towards statehood. No sooner had
Netanyahu returned to Israel than his foreign minister, Ariel Sharon,
urged settlers to 'seize every hilltop they can' in the West Bank. In
a real battle of wits between equal partners, Arafat might have made a
few Netanyahu-like conditions: no continuation of the 'peace process'
unless Israel renounced its exclusive claim to Jerusalem as a
capital—which precluded 'final status' talks; no more Jewish
settlements on occupied Arab land; no more negotiations until
Netanyahu ended Jewish settler attacks on Palestinians. But Arafat
could not do that — and Washington would not talk to him if he did. So
the Wye talks probably ended any Palestinian hope for a just
peace. Israel would be allowed to go on building more Jewish
settlements on occupied land, confiscating Palestinian identity
papers, demolishing Palestinian homes. And Arafat — for perhaps 14 per
cent of the 22 per cent of mandate 'Palestine' that was left — had
promised to protect the Israelis who were building the settlements,
confiscating the identity papers and demolishing the homes"

Microsoft are effectively giving up on Copilot Pro subscription
($20/month) as almost nobody paid for it.

Instead they are bundling it into Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions
and inflating the renewal prices there. There’s no opt out.

Effectively allows the Copilot revenue and user numbers to be
inflated"
