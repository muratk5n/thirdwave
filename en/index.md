Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

"With its benign location and natural resources, Mexico has high hopes
for hydrogen. It could attract investments of around $60bn and
generate around 3 million jobs – but for that to happen, a number of
key obstacles need to be overcome [around cert, reg]...

'However, we are at the perfect time to move towards this
transformation; since it is estimated that by 2030 in Mexico the
production of green hydrogen could have lower costs by up to 64%
compared to other countries that do not have the same energy
potential, we also have a privileged location, which allows us to
obtain solar and wind energy, from which green hydrogen is generated,'
added [an expert]"

If Ukraine followed the Minsk aggrement the areas under RU influence
then were smaller than the areas controlled by Russia now. So overall,
this avoidable war has been a net loss for UA. Was the effort worth
it, other than serving Western interests "to contain Russia"?

The find is in the Haftar region (Gen Haftar was supported by Russia).

Al Monitor: "Russia's Tatneft makes new oil discovery in
Libya.. Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation and Tatneft said
they discovered the oil in the Ghadames basin 330 [km] south of the
capital Tripoli at a depth of 8,500 feet. The amount of oil that can
be extracted amounts to 1,870 barrels per day"

TechXplore: "Navid Attarzadeh first noticed the prickly pear cactus
while walking to UTEP's Center for Advanced Materials Research
lab. The team had been exploring nickel as a catalytic replacement for
platinum, a metal that is abundant on Earth.. Nickel, however, is not
as quick and effective at breaking down water into hydrogen.

'Every day, I passed this same plant,' said Attarzadeh, a doctoral
student in environmental science and engineering. 'And I started
connecting it to our catalyst problem. What caught my attention was
how big the leaves and fruits were compared to other desert plants;
the prickly pear has an extraordinary surface area.'

That's when the Attarzadeh had an idea. What if they designed a 3D
nickel-based catalyst in the shape of the prickly pear cactus? The
larger surface area could accommodate more electrochemical
reactions—creating more hydrogen than nickel typically can. The team
quickly designed the nano-scale structure—invisible to the human
eye—and put it to the test. 'We tested the catalyst's ability to split
water repeatedly and had good results'"
