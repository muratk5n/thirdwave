PV Magazine: "Clean hydrogen set for commercial liftoff by
2030.. Department of Energy report says planned project capacity
increased 26% in 2024"

Motor1: "Hydrogen-powered vehicles are already here. Internal
combustion hydrogen engines are being used in commercial applications
in Europe, while numerous automakers globally have patents for
hydrogen engines for both commercial and performance
applications. Just like gas or diesel mills, air is mixed with fuel to
make horsepower. And Cummins already has a special turbocharger to
force-feed these new engines, called the CCS H2 ICE.

It's a variable geometry turbo designed to 'meet the unique
requirements of hydrogen engines,' according to Cummins. The exact
details of the design aren't shared, though it's said to incorporate a
bespoke aerodynamic design that caters best to hydrogen, which has a
lower density compared to gasoline or diesel. A by-product of burning
hydrogen is water, and being a turbocharger, it's driven by the
engine's exhaust system. As such, the turbo is also designed to handle
that water both in terms of power production and longevity"

Jews from the Caucuses (see the Asimov link below) converted into the
religion for political reasons. They made being overtly different a
key part of their political identity. If the Jews descending from this
group (mostly in Europe then US) has any common feature, it is
this... Being different, and overtly so because it helped them in the
area where they came from. The shtick obviously did not help them as
much in 30-40s Germany.

Morgan Freeman:

"America would not be the same without black people"

"They call me African-American, but I'm not African, I am an American".

He is basically saying the same thing.

Racial attributes do not define culture. Immigrants do contribute, can
cause changes, but their kids will assimilate into the whole, not the
little parts their parents brought in. Everyone is a little Irish, a
little black, no matter the race. Religious subcultures cannot remain
isolated either, Jews especially come to mind here who proudly claim
their extremely distinct. They are not.

---

Whichever country you were at between ages 0-7 you have its culture.
You are in it, you are it. Child born to immigrant Jamaican parents
will never be Jamaican. Same is true for others.

---

Iraq, Syria surely have their own singular culture. Culture code
homogenizes existing elements into one, from birth kids would
assimilate into that. I'm talking about politics; when people feel
threatened, what group do they take up arms with?

---

It's not about me wanting secterianism in Syria, or Iraq. Secterianism
already exist, and players position themselves according to it. If you
are making only moralistic arguments against secterianism, you are
missing a large part of what's going on.

I hope they nix the whole thing, and with it gone, there can be
massive pressure to pass a sane gov-funded health insurance measure.

Rubio had issues early on w/ Zio lobby, but since then they seem to
have kissed and made up... If he gets too hawkish, I'll start calling
him *Marco Rubenstein*.

---

Marco Rubio is a known "Zio"; his confirmation happened at breakneck
speed. Hegseth talked a little too much about Pentagon audits, he is
having problems..

Reuters: "New allegations against Hegseth as Senate readies vote on
Pentagon nominee"
