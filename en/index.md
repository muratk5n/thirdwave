Euractiv: "The EU's Hydrogen Bank has begun operations.. By 2030,
Europe wants to produce 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen
annually. To get companies to switch, Brussels is footing the
difference between their ability to pay and the high prices charged by
producers of clean-burning gas"

Hydrogen is going to be a key technology to decarbonise Europe's
industry and help meet our climate targets.  Today, we've launched the
first auction under the European Hydrogen Bank to support the
production of renewable hydrogen in Europe"

Thacker Pass, Nevada, is a place where a massive lithium mine is
taking place. It runs over the human rights of Native American tribes
in the area, displaced decades ago by genocide and forced retreat to
reservations on land thought to be of no value. Now these people,
among the poorest in the US, are being abused again. In addition to
mining's traditional destruction, one ton of lithium requires 500,000
gallons of water to harvest"

"Cambridge researchers' device can turn contaminated water or seawater
into clean hydrogen and purified water, anywhere in the world.. [The
researchers] deposited a photocatalyst on a nanostructured carbon mesh
that is a good absorber of both light and heat, generating the water
vapour used by the photocatalyst to create hydrogen. The porous carbon
mesh, treated to repel water, served both to help the photocatalyst
float and to keep it away from the water below, so that contaminants
do not interfere with its functionality.

In addition, the new device uses more of the Sun's energy. 'The
light-driven process for making solar fuels only uses a small portion
of the solar spectrum - there's a whole lot of the spectrum that goes
unused,' said [one researcher]"

Ethiopia is landlocked which is a big problem for them. If there
was proactive conflict resolution there would be mechanisms to
ensure ETH sea access. 

BBC: "Ethiopia is abuzz with rumours of a new war .. As well as
importing weapons and mobilising his army, [PM] Mr Abiy.. has been
saying that access to the sea is an existential question... Ethiopia's
most obvious target is the Eritrean Red Sea port of Assab, which was
part of Ethiopia until Eritrean independence more than 30 years ago"

Another movie of his *The Dictator* belittles Middle Eastern
countries, supports the view that ppl living in such places along with
their dictators are backward losers. This will lead to the thought
well bomb the shit out of them why not, with, you know, our very
latest awesome new Motherbomber 2040+. The last part the viewer had to
infer himself obvously but hey, leave some stuff to the
imagination. Such is art.

Sacha BC is a shitlib, it makes sense. Shitlibs are Woke, pro-Zionist,
and anti-Russian, which helps the private industrial complex (more
animosity more bombs more money). Woke shifts the discussion from the
economy, gaslights away from extreme inequality, Russia Russia Russia,
Hamas Hamas Hamas helps with weapon sales... This ideology is
manufactured from ground up for the interests of the war lobby.

He plays a person from "Kazakhistan" but the type is generally from
Caucuses, Eurasian looking.. Shown as brash, crass, little stupid -
not much different from how Russians were portrayed in US movies for
decades.

Borat movies are anti-Russian propaganda

Did not watch the debate hosted by Cardigan Shananigan for Newsom-RDS,
no.  I'm sure it was interesting.. I read some excerpts tho - "we have
one thing in common.. neither of us will be the nominee for our party
in 2024”.

FT: "Billionaires amass more through inheritance than wealth creation,
says UBS.. A survey of the global elite shows the ‘great transfer’
between generations has overtaken entrepreneurship"

TDB: "[F]ive weeks after Mike Johnson was elected speaker, and nearly
eight weeks since the attack, Congress doesn’t appear any closer to
passing an aid package—for Israel or for Ukraine, the latter of which
has been 'weeks' away from running out of weapons for months now"

Al Jazeera J Bays made a good point, Lula / Brasil put
forward a UNSC resolution weeks ago to halt Gaza violence, US vetoed
it. Then 29 days later they allowed a similar resolution by
abstaining. In those 29 days there were thousands of additional
deaths.
