Some banks need to fail, it is a sign the system is punishing bad
management. See the plot below, \# of bank bankruptcies per year, data
from FDIC. Notice the two years when there were **zero** bank
closures.  2005, and 2006. What happened afterwards? ðŸ¤”

```python
url = 'https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/bank/bfb-data.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url,parse_dates=['Closing Date'])
df['year'] = df['Closing Date'].dt.year
dfg = pd.DataFrame(index=range(2001,2023))
dfg['closures'] = df.groupby('year').size()
dfg.fillna(0).plot(grid=True)
```
