.. It‚Äôs apparently not very cost effective to make all sorts of
different [headphone] models. But then how do you justify selling
headphones at different prices? Why would someone pay hundreds more
for the same headphones?

Why, just make one version *shittier.* Turns out Sennheiser was
inserting a piece of foam into some of its headphones, to deliberately
lower the sound quality, in order to sell the same headphones at
different prices to different people.

Once you recognize sabotage for what it is, you can‚Äôt help but start
to see it in every aspect of your life: a deliberate shittiness
imposed on us so someone else can earn a profit"

Change is a good thing

NYT: "A rising generation of Republican politicians is more skeptical
of the free market and more comfortable using government power to
regulate the economy than the party has traditionally
been. Consider:Senator J.D. Vance, the Ohio Republican, and Senator
Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts progressive, have collaborated on
a bill to claw back executive pay at failed banks.. Senator Marco
Rubio of Florida has signed a public letter calling for the
reinvigoration of collective bargaining and praising the German
approach, in which labor unions play a larger role in the
economy. Rubio this month published a book, ‚ÄúDecades of Decadence,‚Äù
that criticizes the past 30 years of globalization.Senator Todd Young
of Indiana has helped write a bipartisan bill to restrict noncompete
agreements, which companies use to prevent their employees from
leaving for jobs at a competitor.Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas was
among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who began pushing a few years
ago for federal subsidies to expand domestic semiconductor
manufacturing. President Biden signed a version of the policy last
year"

Ellsberg did a good job.. but folks of his generation were/are too
focused on government while the corporate take over of America
proceeded under their noses... Exposing the truth abt Vietnam shld
have been followed w/ exposing the truth abt corporate malfeasance,
following money trails, tracing kickbacks and the like. RIP.
