FCW: "On January 10th, the first batch of 406 hydrogen fuel cell
sanitation vehicles equipped with GWM Hydrogen-FTXT's hydrogen power
system were officially delivered to customers, marking the successful
implementation of GWM's first 'hundred-unit level' hydrogen sanitation
vehicle demonstration application scenario in Baoding, China.

This batch of hydrogen sanitation vehicles includes three main models:
hydrogen sweeping and washing vehicles, hydrogen cleaning vehicles,
and hydrogen high-pressure flushing vehicles. They were jointly
developed by GWM Hydrogen-FTXT in collaboration with three well-known
Chinese commercial vehicle manufacturers - Changzheng, Yutong, and
Dongfeng. All vehicles are equipped with GWM Hydrogen-FTXT's
self-developed commercial vehicle fuel cell system and hydrogen
storage system. Compared to electric sanitation vehicles, they have
significant advantages such as faster fuel replenishment and better
adaptability to high and low-temperature environments. It only takes
5-8 minutes to complete hydrogen refueling, and a single refueling
allows for continuous operation of over 10 hours"

Space Explored: "New Glenn's second stage, known as GS-2, consists of
two BE-3U engines that are powered by liquid oxygen and liquid
hydrogen. Compared to traditional rocket fuels like RP-1, which is a
highly refined form of kerosene, hydrogen is much more efficient"

GeekWire: "New Glenn's first stage is powered by seven of Blue
Origin's BE-4 engines, fueled with liquefied natural gas. The second
stage makes use of two hydrogen-fueled BE-3U engines

Recent move away from shitlibbery is good, this one, not so good.

404media: "Meta is deleting links to Pixelfed, a decentralized
Instagram competitor. On Facebook, the company is labeling links to
Pixelfed.social as 'spam' and deleting them immediately. Pixelfeed is
an open-source community funded and decentralized image sharing
platform that runs on Activity Pub, which is the same technology that
supports Mastodon and other federated services. Pixelfed.social is the
largest Pixelfed server, which was launched in 2018 but has gained
renewed attention over the last week"

TIL a UK trial of a 4-day workweek with 61 companies was so successful
that 54 kept it, and most made it permanent. Employees worked less but
stayed just as productive, with some companies seeing revenue grow by
35%. Workers also reported better health, less burnout, and even
losing weight.

@Mastodon@mastodon.social

Today Mastodon is taking another step towards its founding ideals:
independence and non-profit ownership. We're transferring ownership of
key assets to a new, European not-for-profit entity, ensuring our
mission remains true to a decentralised social web, not corporate
control.

You can dial up or down politics on your Threads, but I've gotten a
number of questions about the political content control on Threads so
to quickly clarify where it is and how it works. To get there, go to
your profile, the top-right menu, then Account, and then you'll see
'Political content'"

But everyone says Keanu is such a nice guy, we should not say bad
things about him... His fans might get upset.

---

We do not talk about any material concerns here, bunch of Woke shit,
coupled with anti-government propaganda (what Matrix is truly all
about) so the corps paying us benefit, we mark ourselves important get
paid in millions, call it a day. *Next question*

---

NEXT QUESTION

---

I remember another interview around 2000 they asked Keanu about the
Seattle anti-globalisation protests, and how that might relate to the
first movie, he just cuts off the intervier, says "next question!". 

---

I watched the cast interview for Matrix 4, they were discussing how "a
man plugging into the Matrix as a woman" would be *so scandalous* the
studio would certainly nix it... Imagine that.. with all the problems
in the world, this is where you choose to focus? Here is the level of
rebelliousness of their art... All blue Dem dimwits

Keanu Reeves is the worst, total shitlib too..

There aren't many w/ brains in Holywood...

Anderson, *Private Government*: "Consider some facts about how
employers today control their workers. Walmart prohibits employees
from exchanging casual remarks while on duty, calling this 'time
theft.' Apple inspects the personal belongings of their retail
workers, who lose up to a half-hour of unpaid time every day as they
wait in line to be searched. Tyson prevents its poultry workers from
using the bathroom. Some have been forced to urinate on themselves,
while their supervisors mock them. About half of U.S. employees have
been subject to suspicionless drug screening by their employers.
Millions are pressured by their employers to support particular
political causes or candidates. If the U.S. government imposed such
regulations on us, we would rightly protest that our constitutional
rights were being violated. But American workers have no such rights
against their bosses"

will probably force the government into spending cuts, possibly as
soon as today"
