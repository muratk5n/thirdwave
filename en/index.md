For Prez elections the ultimate Hail Mary was from the Rep side during
the 2000 election. I don't mean to downplay the skills of other
campaigns who also won... Maybe they too had it in them to snatch a
win out of the lion's den, just snatching that shit, snatching it and
going home with the trophy.. Maybe. But we didn't see those campaigns,
we almost exclusively saw the ones who won with an advantage. I need to
base the take on data.

done deal. These c--suckers are always selling...

three figures have low approval ratings, one is certainly on the way
out. The war in Ukraine is not going well for the "Rules-Based Order"
and the opposition is coalescing.
