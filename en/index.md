Design Boom: "Euro Airship is developing Solar Airship One, a
whale-shaped aircraft that plans to fly around more than 25 countries
for 20 days without stopping using solar power and hydrogen. Its plan
to take off in 2026 is looming, and the team is hustling to make sure
that the first non-stop world tour flight without fossil fuels will
meet its deadline. Euro Airship believes that its aircraft will be
flying without any noise, fossil fuel, or carbon emissions..

The aircraft, powered by solar and hydrogen, is expected to be 151
meters long with a rigid airship and a helium expansion volume of
53,000 m3. Almost its entire surface will be covered with 4,800 m2 of
solar film to fully capture sunlight. By day, it collects the sun’s
energy; by night, the surplus electricity is stored in fuel cells that
produce hydrogen via water electrolysis"

Needs testing.
