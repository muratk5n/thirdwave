Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

You dont need `cdist` from Sigh Pie; that code is a one-liner, works
even for vector -> matrix distances.

---

There; 3D interpolation via Quad Trees. It only depends on "Num Pie".

Interesting take from Al Monitor. They paint Burhan not in a strong
position, but Hemeti with access to resources he can buy loyalty with.

WSJ: "Company Insiders Made Billions Before SPAC Bust. Executives and
early investors sold shares worth $22 billion.. At their peak, SPACs
accounted for 70% of all IPOs. But now, the market has dried up and
shares of companies that did SPAC deals have crashed"

*Pompeii* was ok.. rivalry between Rome vs Pompeii..? It was tough to
sell Keifer Sutherland as a goombah, but I think overall it
worked. Good guys - Celts, slave gladiators, citizens of Pompeii. Bad
guys - Romans. Lovely.

---

Simple algo; find closest points to new point in existing data,
compute distances to each, use that as weights to average their z
values.

---

"Sigh Pie" dependencies... Not usable on every platform. Major pain in
the neck. 3D interpolation should not require this much external code.

It wouldn't be as punishment for Darfur, or even the current crisis
that is displacing many.. Sudan is looking like a failed state but US
wld be more worried about a Red Sea Russian base.

---

A-uh.. George Clooney videos are back in circulation, when he was
trying to "raise awareness on Darfur". Psyop in the works laying the
groundwork for a Sudan intervention?
