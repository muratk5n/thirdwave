Here is how a realistic movie would be like. An AK shoots 600/min, in
120 minutes 72K bullets. So the movie could be about just one guy, he
shoots an AK non-stop, from beginning until the end, constantly
reloading, and by the end of the movie, maybe he'd have taken out
one enemy soldier.

Belfast Telegraph: "[2011] US forces have fired so many bullets in
Iraq and Afghanistan - an estimated 250,000 for every insurgent killed -
that American ammunition-makers cannot keep up with demand"

---

The lone gunman among unarmed civilians, or the stock bullshit
Holywood war movie is based on a myth. The hero sprays bullets around,
shoots 100 and kills 100. Reality is going after people who are just
as intent on killing you, and that is hard. Read: "During World War II
it was estimated that 45,000 rounds of small arms ammunition was fired
to kill one enemy soldier. In Vietnam the American military
establishment consumed an estimated 50,000 rounds of ammunition for
every enemy killed".

Personal weapons are the perfect market for arms co. The demand fit
with the politics of the times (anti-government, buy guns to "protect
yourself"), they sold these essentially useless products by the
millions.

---

Arms manufacturers would like personal weapon demand to be at consumer
product level, everyone buying one or two, w/ contracts on
maintanance, some ammo purchases here and there. "Consumers" shoot
their little toy around for a little show, nothing more. When things
get serious arms co could get worried, real war is serious
business. All of a sudden you need ammunition in the millions,
production needs to ramped up for certain things not for
others.. Producing little gadgetry is different from war-time
production, and not necessarily as profitable.

Three-dimensional chess my ass... It's more like one-dimensional checkers.

US is not an empire and it does not have a deep state - even the
shadiest shit is known to the decision makers, some of whom are
naturally bought out by moneyed interests. Some geniunely might think
they are involved in deep strategery hence they are favored by the
donors because their stupid moves will still help the complex, whose
only time horizon is the next quarter.

---

Government is a huge organization, there are all kinds of people in
it, it is tough to make it go totally fascistic. I would be more
worried of Coca-Cola then some imagined "deep state".

Watched California Senate debate; my picks, Barbara Lee \#1, Porter
\#2.  Schiff made some suprising noises on taxation, not bad. But
there is too much big money behind him, not clear he would be a
reliable vote on important issues.

That is hilarious he uses that word too, according to the book *Evil
Geniuses* the real asshole was his father, John Sununu, described
exactly in those terms. Apparently noone in US politics did more
damage to the climate cause than him. Excerpt below:

>The surname Sununu is familiar today mainly because of a pair of
>recent New Hampshire politicians, a governor and a U.S. senator, but
>the most significant Sununu was their father, John H. Sununu, himself
>a former New Hampshire governor and the first President Bush’s first
>chief of staff. In several important ways, he was another prototypical
>Republican for the new age: an asshole personally, a conservative
>hard-liner, and a critical figure in turning the party toward full-bore
>denial of climate change.

---

He just mad the candidate he supported did not win in his home state.
What do youngsters say these days? CRINGE.

Politico: "‘Assholes come and go’: Trump isn’t the future, Sununu says"

You can't bitch about Navalny if you had anything to do with Assange's
