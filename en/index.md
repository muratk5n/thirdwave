PJ Onori: "Itâ€™s 2025. Read.cv is shutting down. WordPress is on
fire. Twitter has completely melted down. Companies are changing their
content policies en masse. Social networks are becoming increasingly
icy towards anything outside of their walled garden. Services are
using the content you post to feed proprietary LLMs. Government
websites appear to be purging data. Itâ€™s a wild time.

Itâ€™s hard to know where this bottoms out. And those who rely on these
services are just along for the ride. Web 2.0 seemed like such a great
idea in a more innocent time. Weâ€™re at a point where itâ€™s only prudent
to view third-parties as guilty until proven innocent. Not as some
abstract, principled stance, but for our own direct benefit.

Now, more than ever, itâ€™s critical to own your data. Really own
it. Like, on your hard drive and hosted on your website. Ideally on
your own server, but one step at a time"

You have to know regex my friend. Hard core scraping requries regex.
Otherwise you'll never be 1337.

"Scraping" is the term used for the kind of code that fetches a Web
page, removes all the visual elements and retains only the raw data
part of it, like scraping the outer paint off a wall, you see?

I guess the build up is ongoing.. Massive numbers are not visible yet.

```python
df = u.get_pd().read_csv("gfp-2025.csv",index_col='country')
navy = ['Aircraft Carriers','Helicopter Carriers','Destroyers',\
        'Frigates','Corvettes','Submarines','Patrol Vessels','Mine Warfare']
df.loc['Turkey',navy]
```

```text
Out[1]: 
Aircraft Carriers       0
Helicopter Carriers     1
Destroyers              0
Frigates               17
Corvettes               9
Submarines             13

They claim TR is building up a massive navy, is it true? We check,

I haven't double checked this, it is interesting OSI chimed in

OSI: "A year ago we called on Meta to stop calling Llama 2 'Open
Source.'  Since then, Meta has released new versions of Llama with new
licensing terms that continue to fail the Open Source
Definition. Llama 3.x is still not Open Source by any stretch of the
imagination"

SP 500 recovered from the dip already and broke another record. Rich
people create bubbles. That immense amount of money has nowhere else
to go. Every dip is an opportunity to buy.

F--kers are so full of bile and their cause is so f-ing dumb (creating
artificial demand for US private weapon complex in ME in the guise of
returning to a land they [didn't even leave](2020/06/10-myths-israel.html#samejew)
in the first place), they have to eventually turn inward and eat themselves,
their own kind.
