Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Happy Anzac Day bitchez! (Apparently it's on April 25th)

Current Oz Labor gov is continuing the nuke sub deal AUKUS. A former
Labor leader [criticized](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/paul-keating-labels-aukus-submarine-pact-worst-deal-in-all-history-in-attack-on-albanese-government)
the decision as "the 'worst deal in all history', because [the same money] could
buy 40 to 50 conventional submarines instead". He says, correctly,
conv subs are more than sufficient to defend Australia from attacking
navies. But of course that's not the point of the nuke sub deal. Nuke
subs are needed for attacking China, in their turf, and that's the point,
AUKUS isn't about direct homeland defense, it is about offense. You are
going Galipoli again, in return for a superpower help, just like during WWI,
1915 when you attacked a people with whom "you never had an angry word with".

---

The deaths of those soldiers did mean something, in strategic terms,
not in the way regular people understand war. Galipoli wasn't a case
of "I was attacked now I defend myself" it was a case of "I must
invade A who is part of alliance B because I need the protection of C
against some way distant future possibly invasion of X".

---

Anzac support was due to a security / neutrality trade-off for Oz; you
offer your services, in location, in human lives, to a superpower
(Britain then, US now) to get "protection" in return. The reason for
the Anzac rememberence rituals are kept alive today is to remind
people a similar sacrifice might be asked of them again.

When his Galipoli movie came out, Russell Crowe gave an interview, the
responses from people were interesting. Some were like 'Wut'? That is
a national narrative at work, they reside in subconcious, sit there as
unquestioned, banal conclusions. When questioned ppl are shocked.

There were New Zealanders in Anzac; the word is is an acronym for the
**A**ustralian and **N**ew **Z**ealand **A**rmy **C**orps. This piece
of history interests me obviously bcz Anzac were sent by Brits to
Galipoli attacking my hood.

H2 View: "A first shipment of independently-certified low-carbon
ammonia has been shipped from Saudi Arabia to Japan for use as fuel in
power generation.

<img width='340' src='https://thearabposts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Saudi-arabia-8.jpg'/> 

The ammonia was produced by SABIC Agri-Nutrients (SABIC AN) with
feedstock from Aramco, and sold by Aramco Trading Company to the Fuji
Oil Company (FOC). Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) was tasked with shipping
the liquid to Japan, then the low-carbon ammonia was transported to
the Sodegaura Refinery for use in co-fired power generation, with
technical support provided by Japan Oil Engineering Co (JOE).

The ammonia is categorised as low-carbon because carbon dioxide (CO2)
from the associated manufacturing process was captured and utilised in
downstream applications"
