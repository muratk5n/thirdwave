The Grayzone: "[2024/03] Leaked Israel lobby presentation urges US
officials to justify war on Gaza with ‘Hamas rape’ claims.. Two
prominent pro-Israel lobby groups [investigating] on how to influence
public opinion in favor of the Israeli military’s rampage in
Gaza.. [relied] on data collected by Frank Luntz, a veteran Republican
pollster and pundit... The Luntz-tested presentations on the war in
Gaza urge politicians to avoid trumpeting America’s supposedly shared
democratic values with Israel, and focus instead on deploying 'The
Language of War with Hamas.' According to this framing, they must
deploy incendiary language painting Hamas as a 'brutal and
savage.. organization of hate' which has 'raped women,' while
insisting Israel is engaged in 'a war for humanity'...

Initiated at Israel’s United Nations mission in December 2023 with
speeches by neoliberal tech oligarch Sheryl Sandberg and former US
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a recipient of hundreds of
thousands of dollars in donations and speaking fees from Israel lobby
organizations, Tel Aviv’s propaganda blitz has yet to produce a single
self-identified victim of sexual assault by Hamas"
