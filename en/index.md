The Guardian: "England’s water system: the last of the privatised
monopolies.. Selling Britain’s state-owned water authorities seemed
like a good idea to Conservative ministers in the 1980s.. Why not let
the private sector inject some energy and much-needed cash into a
project that a tired public sector management was ill-equipped to
handle, they argued.

But since 1989, when 10 regional water authorities were sold, there
has been claim and counter claim about the benefits that can be
credited to the new private sector owners. To the industry’s
detractors, one clear cost is the failure to upgrade a sewer system
that regularly overflows into watercourses, polluting rivers and
killing wildlife"

The relationship between news websites and Google has been backwards
for a while as sites make content optimized for Google.

The latest and most absurd trend is sites like CNet deleting old
articles (e.g. 1996 articles about AOL service tiers) because they
believe Google penalizes old content"

'The only way to lower rents again is public property. As early as
2021, 59.1 percent of [Berlin] voters were calling for
expropriation. (...) Now this commission has reported back that
expropriation is indeed legal and affordable - and what is more, that
no other measure will stop the doubling of rents every decade'"

Marcus: "I first warned of a LLM-driven deluge on February 12, a few
days after Kevin Roose described his sense of 'awe' at the unveiling
of the new GPT-4 powered Bing—and a few days before it notoriously
recommended he get a divorce—in that brief initial period in which
Bing and GPT-4 were viewed through entirely rose-colored
glasses... The general thesis of the article was the Google ought be
pretty concerned by what was coming; the subtitle was 'How sewers of
lies could spell the end of web search'"

A theory goes since inflation has to do with circulation of money in
the economy among regular people, if mega corporations run the roost
all money would eventually end up in their coffers, out of the
circulation, so in essence they'd have an deflationary effect. See
Amazon's total assets,


```python
u.biz_balance("AMZN")['totalAssets'] / 1e9
```

```text

2022-06-30    419.728

That is a a rise from $221 billion in 2020.

Farmer: "Actually, it's insane: we import feed from South America,
which deprives farmers there of the opportunity to produce food. They
are hungry because soya is produced for European cattle. We use this
soy to produce products that we don't need here, export them at
dumping prices - preferably to Africa, where we ruin the farmers who
will eventually be here as refugees"
