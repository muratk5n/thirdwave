SciTechDaily: "The [Korea Institute of Energy Research] has achieved a
historic milestone in Korea by successfully producing hydrogen of
exceptional purity from ammonia, completely eliminating carbon dioxide
emissions in the process. Dr. Jung Unho’s research team at the
Hydrogen Research Department of the Korea Institute of Energy Research
(KIER) has developed Korea’s first clean hydrogen production
technology. This innovative approach is based on ammonia decomposition
and does not use fossil fuels. The team’s breakthrough could pave the
way for a more sustainable and eco-friendly energy source. This allows
for the production of high-purity hydrogen that meets international
standards for hydrogen-powered vehicles, without the carbon dioxide
emissions produced by using fossil fuels"

Crikey: "Nobel laureate economist savages his own profession as
clueless and unethical.. economist Angus Deaton has delivered a
ferocious rebuke to his own profession, saying economists have failed
to understand that capitalism is about power"

Workers at Ski Resort town are priced out of the housing market. The
rich have their nice houses but the serfs they need to serve them
cannot live in that same town. Sad.

Andersen: "A billionaire member of [the Koch] political network.. was
also apoplectic about [a..] mere suggestion that private equity guys
like him should pay taxes on their incomes at an income tax rate of 35
percent, as it was then, instead of the capital gains rate of 15
percent... David Koch died in 2019, but Charles remains overseer of
the interconnected political operations, which are spending $100
million to 200 million a year, mainly on election campaigns. From his
personal foundation’s assets of nearly 1 billion, he spends an
additional 100 million a year promoting the political interests of the
rich and big business.

Drove people out of their lands to make space for sheep? Brutal.

Ben Goldsmith: "Sheep are the number one cause of the loss of rural
villages, rural communities over the last 500 years in Britain. Since
Tudor times it was rich people buying land clearing villages in the
form of the highland clearances in order to make way for very large
sheep branches. It's well documented, my mother's own ancestor the
Duke of Southernland drove his tenants to the west coast of Scotland
and ultimately, across the Atlantic, in order to clear the land so he
could have vast numbers of sheep. They cut the trees sold the timber
to the Navy, and filled the land with sheep. That's how the numbers of
sheep over 200 years inflated by 80-fold. Then of course the price of
wool collapsed, today sheep represent less than 1% of the total
calories produced in this country"

If wealth is not redistributed what is owned by the rest, even
cooperatively shared, is worth less. If you are using anything that is
supplied by a larger system (such as money), you are part of that
system. It is not possible to withdraw into some turtle shell and live
happily ever after there.

Also need better taxation

"phil_stevens@mastodon.nz

@abetterjulie The best chance we've got is to build small, human-scale
parallel systems wherever we have the audience and the
agency. Grass-roots mutual aid, food sovereignty, cooperative housing
arrangements"

Due to top 1% hoarding assets and/or causing their prices to rise, ppl
increasingly cannot afford to buy, they pay rent to the rich. Govs are
in debt held by the top 1% so even your govs pays interest (rent) to
the rich. Their very presence can turn any economy into an asset
economy. Excess wealth has to be placed somewhere and it goes after
such investments. The econ is so tilted towards this group no matter
where the money is pumped towards, it still ends up with them. Yes in
2008 banks were given money. But 2020 regular people were given
*direct aid* even that ended up with the top 1%. All flows end up
there. It needs to be reversed.

Since the 80s US let inequality run rampant (via tax policies, worker
org limitations) which allowed the rich get richer and change the
economy into an asset economy. Same zeitgeist gave rise to monopolies,
in all areas of business, not just tech.

Feudal order goes beyond tech. Rentier economy did not start on
2008. But the ideas are generally in the right direction.

"[C]apitalists.. have turned into (very well-off) vassals, who have to
pay their dues to techno-feudal lords (Amazon; Google; Apple;
Meta)..

As a response to the combined effect of the privatisation of the
internet on the one hand, and the nearly no-strings-attached way with
which states have injected eye-wateringly large sums of money into
banks and large businesses after the 2008 financial crisis on the
other, rent has supplanted profit as the main driver of the global
economy"

[T]he creator economy is, to be frank, a dead end, a gilded cage that
places a ceiling on what you can achieve.

I like to talk about the DIY economy. The indie economy. 

In the indie economy, creators build their own platforms, whether
that's a website, an app, or a subscription service. They have
complete control over their content, their audience, and their
monetization strategies. They are not beholden to anyone else's
algorithms or policies, and they have the freedom to experiment and
innovate without fear of reprisal.

Building your own platform is undoubtedly harder than relying on
someone else's. It requires a greater investment of time, money, and
effort. But the rewards are also greater"

There's so many remakes and rereleases of everything these days, its
like every media industry is caught in a kind of

"@burgerdrome@aus.social

Hollywood and TV casting agents have a self-selecting bias for
acceptable beauty standards which has over time created an 'actor
class' of aesthetics, also notable in the 'iPhone face'
phenomenon. the end result of this is that basically every actor looks
the same to me now and I genuinely struggle to figure out who the fuck
I'm looking at in any production made after 2005. in my opinion all
casting should be measured against a TWINS (1988) scale of casting
similarities"
