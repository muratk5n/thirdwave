scale low-carbon blue ammonia production facility as equal
partners. The proposed facility, which includes autothermal reforming
with carbon capture, will be located.. nearÂ Corpus Christi, Texas...

Once operational, the production facility will be capable of supplying
low-carbon ammonia to meet growing global demand, with an expected
capacity of 1.2â€“1.4 million tons per annum. Approximately 95 percent
of the carbon dioxide (CO2) generated from the production process is
anticipated to be captured and transported to nearby permanent
geologic storage"

to assasinate Castro but got assasinated himself.
