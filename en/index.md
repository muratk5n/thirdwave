Lookie. Orban misses Merkel.

There was an internal power struggle in the CDU years ago, and today's
chancellor-to-be Merz was ousted by Merkel. The wording at the time
was he was "cut down at a young age", "executed". Now he is back bcz
Merkel is out, you see? Dude might have nursed some anger since; if he
tries to be the un-Merkel bcz of it, that's would be dumb. The
immigration issue aside, AM had the right approach towards the
East. She was an "Ossie" herself.

---

Merz wants to "lead Europe" for a massive UA aid package so they can
continue fighting?

"Steve Bannon warned Republicans that cutting Medicaid would hurt
Trump's base, as many MAGA supporters rely on the program"

Politico: "Republicans [David Valadao, Ken Calvert, Mike Lawler,
Pennsylvania‚Äôs Robert Bresnahan, Dan Newhouse] have a lot to lose if
Congress cuts Medicaid.. GOP lawmakers expected to vote soon on
slashing the insurance program for low-income people represent tens of
millions reliant on it"

I remember the Oval Office press briefing for the announcement, guess
who was there to shower BHO with praise and receive his munee - the
same melon headed son of a bitch we like to dislike - Netanyahoo.  The
linchpin of MILC, military-industrial-Likud-complex.

Reuters: "[2016/09] U.S., Israel sign $38 billion military aid
package"

They must have scared Bama so badly he kowtowed to MIC until the last
second of his admin.

---

BHO admin started fine but capitulated midway, they got scared, gave
in. Trump era shows a tug-of-war between MIC and WH, we'll see how
things work out this time around.

---

Looking at the graph it is clear after 2012 MIC had a bonanza (Syria,
Libya, overall unrest in ME). Higher upward trend seen beginning 2017
but meager growth between 2018-2020, steep fall at 2020 is
understandable, but steady upward trend continued thanks to bought out
officials doing MIC's bidding on Ukraine and other places, like Tony
Blink Blink 737, and "Raytheon Lord" Austin. Biden obviously had his
own "entanglements" in Ukraine.

Macron - Trump meeting, and no one got handcucked this time? Very
strange.

Hear it from the Austrian military, Markus Schwarzenegger explains it
all \#AustrainMil \#Ukraine

Eventually they will take it all back. But it doesn't matter when imo,
RU kills Ukrainian soldiers over there, or kills them over somewhere
else... their strategy is the same, is one of de-militarization,
removing UA as a threat.

Reuters: "Russia says it has taken back major chunk of Kursk region"
