"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.

Furthermore, Earth‚Äôs lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.

Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"

Werdmuller: "For the last few years, AI vendors have had an
interesting marketing playbook: they‚Äôve described the potential power
of the technologies as being so great that it could lead to an
artificial general intelligence that could either kill humanity or
leave us behind and head for the stars. We ignore its power at our
peril.

As it turned out, OpenAI and Microsoft‚Äôs definition of 'artificial
general intelligence' was that the technologies would reach one
hundred billion dollars in revenue. It wasn‚Äôt tied to capabilities
around reasoning, and did not, in actuality, relate to a Terminator
future. It just meant that they‚Äôd be making a lot of money from
it. All the talk of humanity-destroying intelligence and the
existential questions that derived from it just served to draw
attention to their services"

huge'"

RSF vs SAF in Sudan - which is preferable? Neither is democratic, but
one is at least the official military, so given all else equal SAF
is. Egypt is behind them, so that's a plus (Egypt's stability is
crucial for ME).

F24: "Donald Trump bans transgender athletes from participating in
women's sports.. US President Donald Trump signed an executive order
banning transgender athletes from women's sports, citing the need to
protect female athletes. The order, which could strip schools of
federal funding for non-compliance, was signed at the White House amid
applause from supporters, including key Republicans. Trump declared
the move a defense of women's sports traditions"
