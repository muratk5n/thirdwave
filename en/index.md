Monbiot: "I seem to recall the country voting the Tories out last
year. Part of the reason.. was their staggering incompetence and
insouciance, epitomised by Liz Truss’s mini-budget. That catastrophe
was, like Truss’s political career, formed and steered by the
neoliberal junktanks of Tufton Street... We booted them out through
the front door.. Yet they still appear to be in the house. Perhaps
they came round the back..

After taking an interest in the Department for Business and Trade’s
“growth school” speaker sessions for civil servants, I sent a freedom
of information request.. Among the external instructors used by the
department’s 'growth school' so far are no representatives from trade
unions, social justice, human rights or environmental groups, and no
representatives from left or liberal thinktanks such as the New
Economics Foundation or the Institute for Public Policy Research. But
there are four who work or have worked for the Tufton Street junktanks
that surrounded Truss."

The Lever: "The Secret Curriculum That Rewired America’s Judges.. For
decades, big business-funded economics courses have been pushing the
nation’s judges to the right. A new study in the Quaterly Journal of
Economics reveals nearly half of U.S. federal judges attended crash
courses in economics at the conservative-leaning Manne Economics
Institute for Federal Judges between 1976-1999 - and it changed how
they behaved on the bench"

Do not pity the man... he was a f-ing centrist, of the Blair and
Clinton mold... 

NYT: "U.K. Ambassador to U.S., Peter Mandelson, Fired Over Epstein Links"

Charlie Kirk was having second thoughts about being a Zio before his
death..? Maybe Israel had him killed. ISR is on a bombing spree, why
not an influential organizer?

---

There are bizarre dead zones in the map, eg SE Aleppo around the
lake. Who is in charge there?

HTS took out a chunk out of the Druze (As-Suweida), and lost territory
