Dessler: "Is climate change making Florida's flooding worse?.. Warmer
air can hold more water vapor â€” about 7% more for every degree Celsius
increase in temperature. Consequently, the air converging into a storm
system in a warmer climate carries more water vapor. Since most of the
water vapor entering the stormâ€™s updraft will fall out as rain,
everything else the same, more water in the air flowing into the storm
will lead to more intense rainfall. Thatâ€™s it. Not terribly
complicated...

[T]he IPCCâ€™s synthesis report concluded.. 'The frequency and intensity
of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most
land areas for which observational data are sufficient for trend
analysis (high confidence), and human-caused climate change is likely
the main driver.. The projected increase in frequency and intensity of
heavy precipitation (high confidence) will increase rain-generated
local flooding'"

Doctorow: "Bill Gates didn't become one of the richest people on earth
simply by [luck]; he also owed his success to vigorous antitrust
enforcement. The IBM PC was the company's first major initiative after
it was targeted by the DOJ for a 12-year antitrust enforcement
action. IBM tapped its vast monopoly profits to fight the DOJ,
spending more on outside counsel to fight the DOJ antitrust division
than the DOJ spent onÂ allÂ its antitrust lawyers, every year, for 12
years.. [later] Reagan let IBM off the hook.  But the company was
still seriously scarred by its ordeal, and when the PC project kicked
off, the company kept the OS separate from the hardware (one of the
DOJ's major issues with IBM's previous behavior was its vertical
monopoly on hardwareÂ andÂ software). IBM didn't hire Gates and Allen to
provide it with DOS because it was incapable of writing a PC operating
system: they did it to keep the DOJ from kicking down their door
again"

If ancient Greeks knew, they would toss lithium-ion batteries onto
enemy ships, then that would be the Greek fire.

---

I'd swim away as fast as possible away from that f-ing battery. Electrocution
aside it can catch fire, sea water would not put it out bcz lithium-ion fires
are self-oxidizing. So you will get a shock **and** burn, at the same time!

---

If you are on a battery-electric boat and it sinks, while a shark
approaching do you stay on boat get electrocuted when the water hits
the battery or swim away and get bitten by a shark? ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚. \#DJT

The American Conservative: "Trump Visits the Bronx.. The crowd at the
New York City rally was diverse in the literal sense of the
word... Standing in that crowdâ€”black, white, and every shade in
betweenâ€”I found it hard not to laugh at the countless articles
denouncing Trump as the candidate of white supremacy. There were girls
in cowboy hats and crop tops, guys with neck tattoos and Trump
chains. Young orthodox Jews rubbed shoulders with old church ladies...

[M]ost of the people at Trumpâ€™s rally worked with their hands or ran
businesses in the non-symbolic economy. Trump seemed to intuit this
and spent an inordinate amount of time talking about construction
projects heâ€™d been involved inâ€”the Wollman Rink in Central Park, the
border wall. He launched into long excurses on copper tubing and
concrete planks. He dilated on the type of work that needed to be done
to fix the subway system. The crowd ate it up"
