Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Of course the culprit is modern tech, and people

WION: "Why do whales commit suicide? Answer may be sonar.. [H]ow could
the ocean's most accomplished deep-sea diver wind up with nitrogen
bubbles poisoning its veins..  'In the presence of sonar they are
stressed and swim vigorously away from the sound source, changing
their diving pattern.. which makes the animals accumulate nitrogen'
[says expert]..

Starting around 1960, ships began emitting underwater signals in a
range of about 5 kilohertz (kHz). That is when the mass beaching of
beaked whales, especially in the Mediterranean, began... The most
deadly episode, in 2002, saw 14 stranded over a 36-hour period in the
Canary Islands during a NATO naval exercise"

Beached whales - sad.

'My hot take on '15 minute cities' is if you can get to the coffee
shop within fifteen minutes, but the barrista who makes your drink
can’t afford to live closer than a half-hour away, then you live in a
theme park.”

Science Daily: "A solar hydrogen system that co-generates heat and
oxygen... EPFL researchers have built a pilot-scale solar reactor that
produces usable heat and oxygen, in addition to generating hydrogen
with unprecedented efficiency for its size"

This is direct solar-to-H2 wout electricity

Paper: "Here we present the successful scaling of a thermally
integrated photoelectrochemical device—utilizing concentrated solar
irradiation—to a kW-scale pilot plant capable of co-generation of
hydrogen and heat. A solar-to-hydrogen device-level efficiency of
greater than 20% at an H2 production rate of >2.0 kW (>0.8 g min−1) is
achieved"
