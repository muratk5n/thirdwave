When it was on, the game was great. You could even do variations; you
could say "Democrats and Republicans need to come together" even when
the schisms they experienced were manufactured and subpar, but the uniter
narrative offered some brownie points.. You could pretend to [hate the game](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1r8wAGwhOmflPy0vCbbSEM0mSb16Ua7qF), 
while being a much loved player in it (at least for one side)..

The gun issue *became* deadly of course due to neglect, in a sane
political discourse it could have been solved. Now it is hot-button
material, untouchable, member on each side need to be fanatical about it
to affirm their party allegiance.

The establishment is dying to go back to that narrative (great for
ratings, makes politicians look like they are actually discussing
something, albeit second-rate, usually agreeable stuff). At the
same time of course both sides offer bipartisan support to a war that
could be ended in a day, letting a legit journalist rot in jail
and healthcare issue kept MIA. The guy who says he signed up to military
to fight in [useless wars](2023/03/isiah-james-iraq.html) because he was poor and
had no healthcare gets no traction. That shit is just too real - not
part of the plan.

Ah the good ol' gun issue is back, with racial overtones this time
\#Tennesee. Culture war, the next phase. Throw in some abortion, "trans
issues", with little toxic masculunity on the side the picture would
be complete. Continuing on the [Dick Morris](2021/10/all-too-human.html#triangulation)
plan.
