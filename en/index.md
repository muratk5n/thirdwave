Techcrunch: "Hyundai, Nikola, Bosch and others are seriously pushing
fuel cells, but why now?.. There’s political will, and money. Federal
investments in green hydrogen and refueling infrastructure — two big
obstacles to widespread adoption — are giving HFCVs a boost"

This tracking stuff on the Internet is past ridiculous. I notice that
when I pull up my Orders page on Amazon, uBlock blocks 133 items. When
I pull up Accuweather for my town, it blocks 273 items.

Here on Mastodon, both uBlock and Privacy Badger read zero. Funny how
that is"

Working for private sector does not equal being a good capitalist
either.  You are asked to manage a plant, or work as an accountant, you
are still in a bureucracy, not completely exposed to the market forces
outside your own corner. You are asked to do certain things, you judge
how long they would take, ask for resources, give a timeline. This is
tecnical, bureucratic work. You are not operating a lemonade stand
waiting for customers yourself. You are the guy behind the scenes,
working in the lemonade bureucracy.

People subconciously, rougly will vote for a person who would be a
*good manager*, someone likable enough to tolerate as a boss. That's
not the same thing as being a "good capitalist".

"Voters vote for a good capitalist, they will reward such a person"

The purpose of junior developers is to grow into senior
developers. Replacing them with "A.I." is like replacing all your
unripened tomatoes with pasta sauce. There'll be a shortage of ripe
tomatoes - and pasta sauce - come next season"

"Head to head approval match-ups" do not capture the whole story. It's
not easy to beat an incumbent (party) after its first term (easier
after the second).

How low Biden's approv has to be to lose his advantage in the general?
With 2% GDP growth if net approval goes to -30% then the challenger has
an advantage. It is getting there.

Biden's approval numbers fall and fall.. 

```python
app = u.biden_approval()
app = app[app.index > '2023-01-01']
app['net'].plot(title="Biden Net Approval")
```

There is some kind of DDos attack on Codeberg, the main site of this
