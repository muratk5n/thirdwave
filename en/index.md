Dr. Ekberg: "I don't see any reason to ever buy store-bought juice
because it has to be pasteurized in order to be sold in a store and
now you're destroying most of the benefits.  Most of the enzymes.. the
phyto-factors, polyphenols and whatever else might be in that juice
you're destroying it with that pasteurization, so when you put a big
red X on that because all you're really getting now is sugar water.

Yeah it's a little bit better than Coca-Cola, but not a whole lot.
Orange juice is about 8% sugar.  Apple juices about 10% sugar. So if
you have a cup you're already getting about 25 grams of
sugar. Absolutely not a good idea for any of these protocols no matter
what your goal is for weight loss or reducing insulin resistance stay
away from store-bought juice"

F24: "Paris votes on banning self-service e-scooters.. Self-service
e-scooters have become commonplace on the streets of Paris since they
were first introduced five years ago, but irresponsible use and a
rising accident toll have hardened city hall’s attitude towards the
popular mode of transport"

BTW can enough carbon be captured from the air for all efuel needs? If
they cut bunch of trees burn them to obtain "neutral carbon" (trees
took it from the air, putting it back is sort of "neutral") then
that's not a good path. Hopefully pure H2 usage is encouraged more.

Science: "[N]atural hydrogen is always being made afresh, when
underground water reacts with iron minerals at elevated temperatures
and pressures. In the decade since boreholes began to tap hydrogen in
Mali, flows have not diminished, says [expert]"

Backpedaled on the spot.. LOL

Politico: "A bipartisan Senate bill that would rein in the
Chinese-owned app [Tiktok] is facing its first real headwinds... this
week saw a significant backlash to RESTRICT... The furor soon reached
Fox News — on Wednesday, host Jesse Watters called RESTRICT “garbage”
and suggested it would curtail personal freedoms... Watters demanded
an explanation from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a sponsor..  who had joined
him on the program. But Graham said he was unaware that he had signed
onto the bill — and suggested that if it was as bad as Watters said,
he may need to retool"

Palestenian rocket firings by date and count, fired mostly from
Gaza. Obviously WB is key in strat terms but to what lengths will ISR
go to take it? Can anyone truly be safe from anything? Is Belgium safe
from Luxemburg? It's "right there" after all..

West Bank is indeed more mountainous compared to rest of Israel. 

```python
ps = [["West Bank",32.01211, 35.2883120],["Jerusalem",31.7737760, 35.206223]]

Oded Yinon: "Judea, Samaria and the Galilee are our sole guarantee for
national existence, and if we do not become the majority in the
mountain areas, we shall not rule in the country and we shall be like
the Crusaders, who lost this country which was not theirs anyhow, and
in which they were foreigners to begin with"

I wish more people understood that 'I want the computer to generate a
natural language text that sounds like a plausible answer to a
question about x' and 'I want the computer to answer a question about
x' are two very different problems"
