Matt Ferrell: "In the summer of 2023, the Rijnstate hospital of Elst,
The Netherlands opened its doors. What makes this particular campus
interesting is how it generates its energy... The building collects
energy from over 1,300 solar panels located on both the roof and the
ground floor. When there’s a surplus of solar, that energy goes toward
electrolysis, the splitting action that produces hydrogen. This then
allows for hydrogen fuel cells to kick in as a form of reserve power
when the sunnier supplies are low..

<img width='340' src='https://undecidedmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image2.png'/> 

The Rijnstate isn’t the only hospital that integrated hydrogen into
its energy generation this year. Just recently, the Viamed San José
Hospital located in Murcia, Spain, installed a system that involves
powering the creation of hydrogen through its 289 solar panels. The
resulting hydrogen feeds into a boiler for space heating. Meanwhile,
the oxygen produced as a byproduct of the electrolysis is then
repurposed as a critical resource for medical procedures

That’s insanely cool. Those hospitals are good examples of how green
hydrogen is already getting used today..

A while back, I covered a new form of electrolyzer by the Australian
company Hysata. Its design is really promising, with an efficiency
rating jumping from about 75% to a whopping 95%..

There’s also Sparc Hydrogen, a collaboration between Sparc
Technologies, the University of Adelaide, Flinders University, and
Fortescue Future Industries.14 Unlike typical setups, Sparc’s hydrogen
production method doesn’t require an electrolyzer or electricity
pulled from renewable energy infrastructure. Instead, it’s based on
photocatalytic water splitting, or PWS"

SciTechDaily: “Over 12,000 participants, aged 45 to 74, were followed
for 20 years in the #Singapore Chinese #Health Study.. Higher caffeine
intake was associated with lower odds of physical frailty, regardless
of the source”

A rise in homelessness, same thing. If anything trickle-down economics
occurs only here - one percenter buys homes in excess snatching it
away from upper middle class, who do the same for middle class, down
and down it goes, and all of a sudden lower income person can't buy or
rent (rent price is a reflection of purchase price), ends up on
the streets. This is clear to see in the statistics, the modern
homeless isn't some random bum, half of these people are actually
employed!

Ergo "housing crisis" is not about shortage in overall housing. The
crisis is a reflection of the society's inequality, there are enough
homes but the rich are buying them, as investment, end most end up
with no affordable housing. Middle class buys bread, wealthy buy
assets. If they have too much money, distribution is skewed, there
will be a bubble in the prices of those assets.

Stevenson: "[2023/05] Most people in ordinary financial positions or poor
financial positions tend to spend all of their income over the course
of their life on goods and services. They generally die without any
accumulated assets, which means that they've spent everything on goods
and services. Ordinary people buy goods and services that drives
wages.  Rich people, on the other hand, especially very rich people,
tend to spend the majority of their income on buying more assets.

So that means if wealth inequality increases in society, ordinary and
poor people have less, rich and very rich people have more. Society as
a whole will start to want more assets and less goods and services.
And that is because we're moving purchasing power away from ordinary
people, who like goods and services, towards rich and very rich people
who like to buy assets.  So as inequality increases, asset prices
naturally go up.  Goods and services and wage prices naturally go
down.

But if you remember, our central banks are trying to ensure that goods
and services prices specifically keep going up at 2, 2.5, 3% a year.
Because we have rising inequality, those goods and services prices,
they want to go down because ordinary people who drive those prices
are losing their purchasing power. That means that for most of the
last 20, 30 years, central banks have been trying to convince ordinary
people to spend money by cutting their interest rates. But remember
those cutting interest rates, not only do they drive up ordinary
prices, they also drive up asset prices for the rich. But asset prices
for the rich are going up anyway, because the rich people are getting
more and more and more money.  So what's happening is this inequality
is driving down wages, driving down the price of goods and services,
and that forces action from central banks and governments, central
banks to cut interest rates, governments to spend more money to try
and support the economy. And a side effect of that is the rich get
even richer and asset prices go up even more.. so in a sense, what
you're seeing is another one of these.. death spirals of the economy"

Talking about death and despair in that uppity college voice.. kudos to
people who can sit through these news conferences. \#US \#spox

"@wilbr@glitch.social

The insult on top of the injury of Israel's genocide is that they're
proving conspiracy theorists right. I can hardly look around without
seeing a billionaire or media conglomerate or government bending over
backwards to support Israel or silence opposition. Critique of the
Israeli military is, according to the US House of Representatives,
anti-Jewish, despite being false on its face. All our allies and the
UN are giving Israel free reign to do whatever it wants with only weak
protest"
