A rough timeline of West-Nato / Russia relations... The Western media
is adept at making people ignore, forget the context on everything via
a process called decontextualization. We need to look at only the
last, or a single chosen "bad act" done by a "bad actor", so that
actor can be properly villified. Such an angle helps their bottom line
justifying all arms spending enriching the military-media private
complex. Some of that hidden context is below. NATO keeps expanding,
year after year, 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2017, 2020, 2024 at the
discomfort of Russia.  A military alliance that insists on keeping you
out encroaches on your border.
