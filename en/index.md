Doctorow: "Tesla is having its own [Dieselgate scandal](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/).
A stunning investigation by Steve Stecklow and Norihiko Shirouzu for
Reuters reveals how Tesla was able to create its own demon-haunted
car, which systematically deceived drivers about its driving range,
and the increasingly desperate measures the company turned to as
customers discovered the ruse"

Good idea. They banned cars from a lot of places. 

"The mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, announced earlier this year the
challenging and innovative concept that would make the capital a
fifteen-minute city, 'la Ville des proximités'. The idea is to create
neighbourhoods where every essential residents’ needs are easily
within reach in 15 minutes by bike or walking"

TDB: "How is congressional stock trading like the weather? Everyone
complains about it. Yet nobody ever does anything about it. Almost
exactly one year ago.. then-House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy
suggested he would support this reform, saying, 'What I’ve told
everybody, we will come back, and we will not only investigate this,
we will come back with a proposal to change the current behavior
[stock trading].' We’re still waiting"

Zombie apocalypse art form seems mostly about a wish than a future
scare. Think about it, apoc. destroys modern life, no more traffic,
work, busy-busy pace.. People spread out into all corners of the
world, live closer to nature, less density. Zombies represent a
constant threat, kill-or-be-killed situation harks back to a
pre-agriculture hunter-gatherer state, when we had to protect against
predators. The world becomes more public, since the concept of most
private property would lose meaning.

Fortune: "Spend enough time with ChatGPT and other ["AI"] chatbots and
it doesn’t take long for them to spout falsehoods. Described as
hallucination, confabulation or just plain making things up, it’s now
a problem for every business, organization.. Some are using it on
tasks with the potential for high-stakes consequences, from
psychotherapy to researching and writing legal briefs"

The aim of higher education should not be to prepare students for
"jobs". Such education will be stulted, half-assed ergo not much of an

Last boost: Totally pushing the idea into the popular consciousness
that all of the concurrent crises can be fought with more personal
responsibility.

Right.

Same thing happened with recycling and all that. It's not that corps
are making a gazillion plastic straws; it's you, personally, using too
many"

Ecowas is worried surely coups spreading means it will come to their
countries one day. Mali and Burkina Faso would be worried if an Ecowas
intervention in Niger succeeded theirs would be rolled back. If Ecowas
intervenes there will be war.

If you have the power in the region, can stop shipments. Russia has
the power - have to negotiate with that. Some RU opponents are too
quick to use name-and-shame, procedure, rules of engagement, "rules
based order" arguments to dismiss opponent's position but, in their
case too, the niceties, formalities, rules had basis on actual power -
the military/econ power of the United States. It was US that provided
much of the military presence that allowed for the subsequent niceties
to exist, that we so quickly accuse Russia of breaking today.  But the
power structure is changing; RU was not happy with the status quo, its
warnings were ignored, so it started the latest engagement. And even
though support for Ukraine sounds "unwavering" today they are not
admitted to NATO, no rich country officially committed troops to the
teather, noone said "one for all all for one". The rest is
demagogueric bullshit.

Danube flows west from Ukraine, it could be used to transport grain as
