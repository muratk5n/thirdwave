UnHerd: "The capitalists are circling over Ukraine.. Western
multinationals had long had their eyes on Ukraine’s vast agricultural
wealth, but a 2001 moratorium on the sale of land to foreigners had
always represented an obstacle to unrestrained privatisation. As
post-Maidan governments turned again to the IMF for financing, aid was
conditioned on a series of land reforms that would finally allow
foreign corporations to acquire vast tracts of the country’s
farmland. In the 2015 TV series, Servant of the People — which starred
Zelenskyy as the fictional president, Goloborodko — the conditions
required by the IMF for a new loan are rejected and the Western
delegation is expelled. But in reality, things went rather
differently. In 2020, Zelenskyy gave in to the IMF’s demands and
finally repealed the moratorium"

Andersen: "Rupert Murdoch had started buying U.S. newspapers and
magazines in the 1970s, including the New York Post, which he turned
overnight.. to right-wing. Jack Kemp said in 1981 that 'Rupert Murdoch
used the editorial page, the front page and every other page
necessary' in the Post 'to elect Ronald Reagan President.'  In 1985
Murdoch moved into television, spending the equivalent of $5 billion
to buy TV stations in seven of the ten biggest cities. Reagan helped:
he fast-tracked Murdoch for U.S. citizenship so that his company could
get around the federal law forbidding foreigners from owning stations,
then waived the federal rule forbidding anyone from owning a TV
station and a newspaper in the same city, as Murdoch suddenly did in
New York and Boston"

Zucman: "As Roosevelt’s [1942] message to Congress expresses clearly,
the quasi-confiscatory top marginal income tax rates championed by the
United States were designed to reduce inequality, not to collect
revenue. Why would anyone try to earn more than a million dollars if
all of that extra income went to the IRS? No employment contract with
a salary above a million would ever be signed. Nobody would amass
enough wealth to receive more than a million in annual capital
income. The rich would stop saving after they reached that point. They
most likely would give their assets to heirs or charities once they
surpassed the threshold. As such, the goal of Roosevelt’s policy was
obvious: reduce the inequality of pre-tax income. The United States,
for almost half a century, came as close as any democratic country
ever has to imposing a legal maximum income"
