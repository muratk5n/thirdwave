Surely politicians favored by donors think they are following a deep
strategery, but the pols who get the money always seem to follow a
certain type of strategery that makes the contractors the most amount
of money. Order is not good, regularly occuring death and mayhem is
preferred. You can't just destroy once, you do it (or allow it to
happen) multiple times. It needs to be repeat business. Raytheon
destroys, Bechtel builds. Then Raytheon destroys again, and Bechtel
rebuilds.. This is a sweet, sweet deal if you can get it. And the
private complex has it.

There is no empire. There is no deep state. There is bunch of
money-grubbing cocksuckers looking for their next payday. That's
what's going on here.

Hossein-Zadeh: "[2006] The American Enterprise Institute (AEI), an
influential Washington think tank and a major lobbying force for the
military - industrial - Likud alliance, can boast of being the
metaphorical alma mater of a number of powerful members of the Bush
administration. For example, Vice President Dick Cheney and his wife
Lynne Cheney, State Department arms control official John Bolton, and
former chair of the Defense Policy Board Richard Perle all have had
long-standing ties with the institute. The institute played a key role
in promoting Ahmed Chalabi’s group of Iraqi exiles, the Iraqi National
Congress (INC), as a major Iraqi opposition force 'that would be
welcomed by the Iraqi people as an alternative to the regime of Saddam
Hussein' once the United States overthrew that regime. From 1998 on,
when there was U.S. government money openly available to support the
Iraqi opposition to Saddam Hussein due to the AEI-backed Iraqi
Liberation Act, Chalabi’s INC grabbed the bulk of the funding. In
return, the INC, working closely with the AEI, played an important
role in the justification of the invasion of Iraq. It served, for
example, as a major source of (largely fabricated) intelligence for
the civilian militarists of the Pentagon whenever they found the
intelligence gathered by the CIA and the State Department at odds with
their plans of invading Iraq.

Another example of the interlocking network of neoconservative forces
in the Bush administration and the militaristic think tanks that are
dedicated to the advancement of the military - industrial - Likud
agenda is reflected in the affiliation of a number of influential
members of the administration with the Jewish Institute for National
Security Affair (JINSA). JINSA 'is on record in its support of the
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and against the Oslo Accord... In
its fervent support for the hard-line, pro-settlement,
anti-Palestinian Likud-style policies in Israel, JINSA has essentially
recommended that ‘regime change’ in Iraq should be 'just the beginning
of a cascade of toppling dominoes in the Middle East.'  JINSA has
influential friends either as liaisons with or members of the Bush
administration. For example, Assistant Secretary of Defense Douglas
Feith is a former JINSA advisor. General Jay Garner, the initial head
of the U.S. occupation authority in Iraq, is also a former JINSA
advisory board member. JINSA advisor Michael Ladeen, who also
unofficially advises the Bush administration on Middle Eastern issues,
has occasionally talked about the coming era of 'total war,'
indicating that the Bush administration should expand its policy of
'regime change' in Iraq to other countries in the region such as Iran,
Syria, and Saudi Arabia. In keeping with its role as a cheerleader
for U.S. intervention in the Middle East, JINSA chose to honor Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz... to receive the 2002 edition
of its Henry M. ‘Scoop’ Jackson public service award. The corporate
sponsor of the affair was Northrop Grumman, a company that Wolfowitz
worked for as a paid consultant prior to joining Rumsfeld’s
Pentagon...

A closer look at the professional records of the neoconservative
players in the Bush administration indicates that '32 major
administration appointees... are former executives with, consultants
for, or significant shareholders of top defense contractors.' For
example, James Roche, former Air Force secretary who took over the
Army, is a former president of Northrop Grumman; his assistant
secretary Nelson Gibbs is another Northrop alumnus. An undersecretary
at the Air Force, Peter Teets, was chief operating officer at Lockheed
while Michael Wynne, a Defence Department undersecretary, was a former
senior vice president at General Dynamics. Defence Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld himself is an ex-director of a General Dynamics subsidiary,
and Paul Wolfowitz, deputy defence secretary, acted as a paid
consultant to Northrop Grumman. Today, point out Hartung and
Ciarrocca, the armaments lobby 'is exerting more influence over
policymaking than at any time since President Dwight D. Eisenhower
first warned of the dangers of the military-industrial complex over 40
years ago'"
