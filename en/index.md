H2 Central: "Aurora Hydrogen, an Edmonton-based hydrogen technology
company, is producing the world’s first high-efficiency clean hydrogen
through methane pyrolysis and collaborating across the industry to
develop the low-carbon hydrogen market in Canada"

H2 Central: "Green hydrogen company Hiringa Energy has launched what
it says is Australasia’s first zero-emission green hydrogen refuelling
network – Hiringa Refuelling New Zealand (HRNZ). The initiative was
officially opened by energy and transport minister Simeon Brown. With
25% of New Zealand’s transport emissions coming from the heavy
transport sector in spite of only making up 4% of the vehicles on the
roads, this marks a groundbreaking step towards decarbonising the
country’s heavy transportation sector, says Hiringa"

Productivity growth (workers producing more with less) does not
guarantee income growth. See [the case of US](https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/112/313/564/334/769/633/original/ebbf8c2067795d43.png).
Factory installs better machines, workers produce more with it, but
will they have barganing power to increase their wages because of
those machines? No. To the contrary during globalisation, in the
absence of unionization, they could lose barganing power.

BOE Gov Mark Carney: "[2015] In the medium term, productivity growth –
doing more with less – is the key determinant of income growth"

US will likely end up like other democratic countries who have deep
structural issues - prez gets elected, in a few months, wham! Net
popularity sinks sub -20,-30 (we see such numbers globally), in that
case even incumbency advantage won't help for a second term, every
president is a one-term president. Gets elected falls to -30, and
booted out in four years. 

"If US prez net popularity keeps decreasing for each prez, where does
that lead?"

While Planck was formulating the black-body radiation he reached a
point when he said "I was ready to sacrifice any of my previous
convictions about physics" (well, except thermodynamics anyway). The
man was ready to throw it all out. That is courageous - the hallmark
of a great scientist.

"In an astonishing [!] turn of events, Israel has failed to provide
evidence to back up its allegations against Unrwa for the UN’s final
report... because that evidence doesn't exist. I know, my jaw dropped
too! Israel had made the totally plausible claim that 1 in 10 Unrwa
workers are members of Hamas, but it provided no evidence to the
independent investigation led by French foreign minister Catherine
Colonna"
