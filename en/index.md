"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.

Furthermore, Earth’s lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.

Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"

HotCars: "AVL RACETECH, the motorsport arm of AVL, took a massive leap
forward in 2022 by unveiling [a 2.0-liter hydrogen-powered internal
combustion engine (H₂-ICE) prototype. With water injection technology
and a turbocharged design, the engine delivers performance figures
that rival modern gasoline racing engines while offering the promise
of zero tailpipe..

AVL RACETECH Hydrogen Engine Highlights

- 150 kW per liter
- Up to 369 lb-ft between 3,000 and 4,000 RPM
- Up to 410 horsepower at 6,500 RPM

Key to this achievement is AVL’s innovative water injection system. By
injecting water into the intake air, the system increases boost
pressure.. This allows the engine to generate up to 369 lb-ft between
3,000 and 4,000 RPM. The design is backed by AVL’s expertise in
advanced simulation modeling and 3D flow calculations, ensuring
maximum efficiency without compromising safety or reliability"

Just like you cannot formulate physics by running regression on
physics datasets, language, human thought can not be formulated via
language data alone. Larger scale produces interesting answers, but no
real-world deployable solutions that include

Chomsky is uniquely qualified to comment on LLMs, as he was the
creator of formal language theory, worked at MIT, aware of
computational issues, approaches in the field.

Paper: "How should the advancement of large language models affect the
practice of science?.. Downstream, LLMs threaten the notion of
scientific expertise, shift incentive structures, and undermine trust
in the literature. Notions of systematic review are undercut by the
randomness inherent in LLM output. And most importantly, when someone
uses an LLM to generate a literature review, the claims generated are
not directly derived from the manuscripts cited. Rather, the machine
creates textual claims, and then predicts the citations that might be
associated with similar text. Obviously, this practice violates all
norms of scholarly citation. At best, LLMs gesticulate toward the
shoulders of giants"

Status Coup: "Liza Star, a pregnant fisherwoman.. lives with her
family about 1,000 feet away from the Moss Landing lithium plant fire
that has sickened residents near and far. Black particles--that seem
to be ash—have blanketed the boat that she and her family live in and
she and her daughters have been suffering with various health symptoms
since the fire nearly two weeks ago"

People who are paying mortgages (mortgagors?) should not be counted as
"home owners". If you paid 1 year of a 10 year mortgage you still
don't *own* a home, you own 10% of a home. 90% of that house is owned
by someone else, the bank or someone wealthy who can hold that debt
and collects interest on it. The statistics should capture this, eg 10
people owning 10% of a house adding up to home ownership of 1.
