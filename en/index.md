Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

An estimate BTW by definition gives a number for discovered + yet
undiscovered reserves an estimate on the total. If the number falls
short, the tech's future is in trouble.

Later in the article he says 'there could be more lithium'. Wishful
thinking... 

---

He understates the problem, the reserves are enough for only a quarter
of transportation needs. At least he acknowledged the problem tho, not
may BEVtards do.

Noah Smith: "The current amount of lithium reserves is worryingly
close to the total that we might need to electrify transportation, and
of course there will be competing demands for lithium from power
storage, robots, appliances, and other applications"

H2 Fuel News: "Why are hydrogen fuel cars such a draw in Japan? Though
Toyota has made the biggest headlines, other automakers are committing
to H2 as well. Toyota has been outspoken in its passion about hydrogen
fuel cars, already having had two versions of its Mirai on the market
for several years, but other Japanese automakers have recently
collectively agreed to develop their own H2 passenger vehicles"

Pakistan's military / civilian rule divide, and the drama associated

familiar.
