Certain inputs are known to regenerate pieces of the training data
verbatim. These parrots (LLMs) essentially compress data and
"creatively decompress". One of those creative ways can be the source
material itself.

"@gvwilson@mastodon.social

Docusign just admitted that they use customer data (i.e., all those
contracts, affidavits, and other confidential documents we send them)
to train AI"‚Å¥

NYT: "Hydrogen Offers Germany a Chance to Take a Lead in Green
Energy.. A subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp, Germany‚Äôs venerable steel
producer, is landing major deals for a device that makes the
clean-burning gas from water.

ThyssenKrupp Nucera.. produces the electrolyzers. The company was spun
off from ThyssenKrupp, a German steel giant, in 2023.

The Nucera project was backed by a German government fund worth 700
million euros, or $746 million. Overall, German state and federal
governments have earmarked ‚Ç¨13.2 billion for investment in about two
dozen projects to develop hydrogen...

Inflation Reduction Act, the 2022 law.. is offering hundreds of
billions of dollars for carbon-free, or green, technology. The
Department of Energy awarded Nucera a $50 million grant last month to
further develop production of gigawatt-scale electrolyzers for North
America...

ThyssenKrupp‚Äôs grab bag of businesses was a world-leading supplier of
equipment for making chlorine, a chemical with many uses including in
drinking water and swimming pools. As it turns out, new iterations of
these machines can be used to make hydrogen"

Post-Gilded Age worker-centric concessions people had from the wealthy
were not taken, they were *given* by the wealthy class
itself. Naturally they did not do it out of the goodness of their
hearts, they were scared. A new system was on the rise (communism),
the business elite felt they had to do something to stop that from
happening in US, so they gave to regular folk as many concessions as
they could without losing their own shirt. As such the concessions
were not permanent. Post 70s/80s saw corporations, the wealthy class
to reclaim their top status with a vengaence. If changes are made now,
they need to be made permanent. The class in power needs to be beaten
down. Power needs to be *taken*.

It is like "the invisible hand" phenomenon in econ. Just like the
combined actions of simple consumers with purchasing power seemingly
creates a direction that looks almost planned, the combined actions of
larger econ individuals (plutocrats) will create a direction as
well. No specific cocksucker is in charge, in a way all of them
are. In their case their purchasing power is larger, they can purchase
entire politicians, small-size countries, pay off high-ranking
officials, brain-wash the public through their media. That will create
certain type of dynamic in governance.

Plutocracies are hard to identify, they are hard to pin down. There
are bunch of private actors working the system from many
angles... Countries with militocratic history cannot fathom bunch of
rich, connected jagoffs running roughshod this way, some oligarchs can
get powerful, but the state can kick their ass, as it happened in
Russia recently. But in US/UK, they've been in charge for centuries.

"Studying government" at uni won't help here because a lot of that
scholarship, teaching is Eurasia centric, going all the way back to
Plato, around regions that have been dominated by military empires
(real ones, not the McFuckFauxEmpire of US). There is some General X,
General Y, someone makes a coup, gets power. There is unrest in the
empire, soldiers get sent to quell, done. Bada bing bada boom. *A
company* having an army larger than the country it originates from (eg
the East India Company) is almost unheard of.

Tucker during the interview asks Putin "who makes the decisions in
US?", Putin is like "I don't know". That was funny.. The answer was
genuine I have no doubt. Here is a famous journalist of many years
from US, asking the President of Russia about who is running his
country, and the Russian president, whose former job was in
intelligence btw, is like  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Interview gold.

That sucks.. I was watching that show

Chris Hedges: "My show on The Real News has been canceled because of
my critiques of the Democratic Party and Joe Biden. I was just
informed by Max Alvarez, the Editor-in-Chief at The Real News, that
they will no longer run my show. The reason for the cancellation, he
said, is that my critiques of Biden, especially for the genocide in
Gaza, jeopardizes his nonprofit status. My last show with Dennis
Kucinich, who is running as an independent for Congress in Ohio, was
removed from the site"
