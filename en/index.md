Fisk: "The moment Ehud Barak was elected Labour prime minister of
Israel in 1999, the satellite television boys and girls—along with the
ever-supine BBC World Service—were putting the 'peace process' back
'on track' once more, even though Barak had made it clear that
Jerusalem must remain the united capital of Israel, that major Jewish
settlements would stay and that no Palestinian refugees from 1948
could expect to return to their original Arab villages...

The pumpkin of the Oslo agreement could never be turned into the
golden carriage of peace, but it took the collapse of the Arafat–Barak
talks at Camp David in 2000 to prove this true. Even then, Clinton was
reduced to claiming that the Oslo negotiations were 'based' on UN
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338— which was not what Oslo said
at all - and even Arafat must have realised that the end had come when
Madeleine Albright made her preposterous offer of 'a sense of
sovereignty' over Muslim religious sites in Jerusalem. Only the silly
villages that Arafat might have controlled outside his would-be
capital would have 'virtually full sovereignty,' according to the
Americans. There then followed the wilfully misleading leaks to the
effect that Arafat had turned down 95 per cent of 'Palestine' — in
reality around 64 per cent of the 22 per cent of 'Palestine' that was
left. Barak would not give up Jerusalem or abandon the
settlements. Arafat would not make the 'concession' of ceding Israeli
control over all of Jerusalem. So the sons of Abraham acknowledged
what so many Israelis and Palestinians knew all along: that Oslo
didn’t work. Clinton predictably saw fit to praise the stronger of the
two parties; he spoke of Barak’s 'courage' and 'vision,' but merely of
Arafat’s commitment. So much for America’s role as 'honest broker' of
the Middle East peace"

Repeating an earlier share: "In 2001 someone tried to blow up a jet
with a shoe bomb so we've had to take off our shoes at the airport for
the last 23 years. In 2017 someone murdered 60 people in Las Vegas,
and that resulted in the bump-stock firearm ban, for only seven
years". Planes blowing up hurts business. Shooters buying guns is good
business, people dying is good business too, other people will want to
buy more guns. If we look at both cases from the lens of citizens,
their unserved needs, politics, things make no sense. But once we
understand business well-being is the primary issue for politicians,
everything makes sense.

Apple Machine Learning Research: "[W]e introduce GSM-Symbolic, an
improved benchmark.. that allow for the generation of a diverse set of
questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations,
providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the
reasoning capabilities. [It] reveal[s] that LLMs exhibit noticeable
variance when responding to different instantiations of the same
question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when
only the numerical values in the question are altered... Furthermore,
we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models
and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the
number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this
decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical
reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training
data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question
causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all
state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to
the reasoning chain needed for the final answer"

Doctorow: "Of course we can tax billionaires.. They disguise their
demands ('don’t tax billionaires') as observations ('it is technically
impossible to tax billionaires')... Billionaires are pretty confident
that they can’t be taxed — not just that they shouldn’t be taxed, but
rather, that it is technically impossible to tax the
ultra-rich. They’re not shy about explaining why, either — and neither
is their army of lickspittles...

Boy is this old trick getting old. It was already pretty thin when
Margaret Thatcher rolled it out, insisting that 'there is no
alternative' to her program of letting the rich get richer and the
poor go hungry. Dressing up a demand ('stop trying to think of
alternatives') as a scientific truth ('there is no alternative') sets
up a world where your opponents are Doing Ideology, while you’re doing
science.

Billionaires basically don’t pay tax — that’s a big part of how they
got to be billionaires.. By cheating on their taxes, they get to keep
— and invest — more money than less-rich people (who get to keep more
money than regular people and poor people, obvs). They get so much
money that they can 'invest' it in corrupting the political process,
for example, by flushing vast sums of dark money into elections to
unseat politicians who care about finance crime"

None of the signals detecting an overpriced market forecasting crash
seemed to work. The only functioning theory is Gary Stevenson's -
massive concentration of wealth causes all asset prices to go
up. After a brief lull, SP 500 is breaking new records. Unequal
economy creating more inequality.
