Econ right keep saying government is bad, they defund it at every
turn, then gov dysfunction rises and they say "see, what did I tell
you, government is dysfunctional, it cannot do anything!"

Andersen: "I’ve talked earlier about how "Government is bad" [message]
becomes self-fulfilling, that an unimpressive and underdelivering
federal government has served the long-term political interests of the
right"

Philips: "[2002 W]hen I published *The Politics of Rich and Poor*,
some of its success was owed to the two lead endorsements on the back
of the book jacket. One was from New York Governor Mario Cuomo, then
widely expected to be the 1992 Democratic presidential nominee. The
second was from former President Richard Nixon, who gave it with full
knowledge that the book was critical of the Reagan and Bush
administrations for favoring the rich. Nixon’s streetcar-worker father
had left Ohio for California after getting a name as labor agitator,
and he thereafter interrupted his McKinley Republicanism to support
third-party progressives like Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and Robert La
Follette in 1924. As president, Nixon himself supported national
health insurance, income maintenance for the poor, and higher taxation
of unearned than earned income. The 1972 Republican platform actually
criticized multinational corporations for building plants overseas to
take advantage of cheap labor"

Might find it interesting that MS is also pushing Copilot and Recall
hard with retail partners.

Best Buy is creating a new role and pushing company wide trainings to
push computers with copilot"

For those who aren’t aware, Microsoft have decided to bake essentially
an infostealer into base Windows OS and enable by default.

From the Microsoft FAQ: 'Note that Recall does not perform content
moderation. It will not hide information such as passwords or
financial account numbers.'

Info is stored locally - but rather than something like Redline
stealing your local browser password vault, now they can just steal
the last 3 months of everything you’ve typed and viewed in one
database"
