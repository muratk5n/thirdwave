Fermi's Paradox asked 'Where is everybody?'  meaning extraterrestrial
aliens, implying given the vastness of the universe and long time it
has existed, there should be advanced extraterrestrial civilizations
throughout the universe. The Drake equation aimed to answer that
question quantitatively, estimates how many active civilizations there
are in the galaxy right now. Using numbers by Andrew Dessler,

$$
N = R_* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L
$$

$R_*$: Number of civilizations with which humans could
communicate. Recent estimates suggest about 2 new stars are formed in
the Milky Way every year.

$f_P$: The average number of planets that can potentially support life
per star that has planets. Most stars have planets, estimate 0.9.

$N_e$: Assume 1 in 5 of stars with planets has a planet in the
habitable zone, 0.2.

$f_l$, $f_i$, $f_c$ : The fraction of planets that could support life
that actually develop life at some point, develop intelligent life,
and develop a technology that releases detectable signs. Wild guess
all 0.1.

$L$: The length of time for which such civilizations release
detectable signals. Unknown, Dessler assumes advanced civilizations
last for ten million years.

```python
"%d planets" % (2 *  0.9 * 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 10*1e6)
```

```text
Out[1]: '3600 planets'
```

But if "instead of 10,000,000 years, advanced civilizations last only
10,000 years", then

```python
"%d planets" % (2 *  0.9 * 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 10000)
```

```text
Out[1]: '3 planets'
```

If advanced civilizations last on average only 1,000 years, due to,
well perhaps some kind of catastropy hits them all, then

```python
"%0.2f planets" % (2 *  0.9 * 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 1000)
```

```text
Out[1]: '0.36 planets'
```

which shows why we are the only one, and "there is no one else". And
btw we will likely go extinct, lose the civilization we built before
our 1000 years are up due to the climate, nuclear war or some other
artifact of modernity.

That is the answer to "where is everyone?", they are all dead due to
one catastrophy or another, not reaching and staying at the level
where they could contact anyone alive like them (us, in this case).

When you think about it, a lot of the UFO sightings really could be
temperature inversions. Odd light formations are already a feature of
antenna arrays and planes, so the main freaky part is that they'll
appear and move impossibly quickly and completely silently. Rather
than lights (or craft) disobeying the laws of physics, it makes a lot
of sense that between our eyes not working great in the dark and
optical illusions working better with high contrast that we're seeing
a hot air lens"

Imagine mandating a technology where selling points in the dead of
winter are: 1) dont run the heater. 2) dont pay attn to the range
estimate, you could lose 40% of that. 3). Dont let it sit in cold
overnight if its below 20% charge. 4) It might take a long time to
charge when its cold which can be exacerbated by long lines & cars
bricked blocking chargers. 5) Virtually none of the raw materials for
the powertrain come from USA or Europe. They predominantly come from
countries that dont like you"

The diva cunt and the Thiel types around him have no pull, and no
understanding of politics.. Bunch of overly rich cocksuckers flailing
around, clueless. Ironically their understanding of tech is even
worse.

King David was a myth? ðŸ¤£ It's like the King Arthur of Brits.. that
mfka did not exist either.

Wiki: "In 2007.. [researchers] stated that the archaeological evidence
shows that [during the tenth century BCE] Judah was sparsely inhabited
and Jerusalem no more than a small village. The evidence suggested
that David ruled only as a chieftain over an area which cannot be
described as a state or as a kingdom, but more as a chiefdom, much
smaller and always overshadowed by the older and more powerful kingdom
of Israel to the north. They posited that Israel and Judah were not
monotheistic at the time and that later 7th-century redactors sought
to portray a past golden age of a united, monotheistic monarchy in
order to serve contemporary needs"
