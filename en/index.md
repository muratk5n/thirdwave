SF Writer Charlie Stross: "[T]he influence of science fiction on our
environment seems to have been gathering pace throughout my entire
life. The future is a marketing tool... It's becoming increasingly
unusual to read a report of a new technology or scientific discovery
that doesn't breathlessly use the phrase 'it seems like science
fiction'. The news cycle is currently dominated by hype about
artificial intelligence (a gross mis-characterisation of machine
learning algorithms and large language models). A couple of years ago
it was breathless hype about cryptocurrency and blockchain
technologiesâ€”which turned out to be a financial services bubble that
drained a lot of small investors' savings accounts into the pockets of
people like convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried"

The Pal prime minister from the PA is talking a bunch on F24. Poor guy
sounds distressed, understandably so. I realized how little we heard
of them in recent years - ISR plan to cut them out of the discourse
clearly worked. It was all about Hamas Hamas Hamas, ISR spox talking
shit about them, that took all oxygen out of the room and now here we
are.

Ian Miell: "I have just returned to front end development after 20-odd
years.

Oh. My. God.

What happened? Maintainability and simplicity used to be a feature,
now it's considered a bug"

Why does Israel rely so much on bombing? Bombs are a money maker for
the [military-industrial-likud](2023/11/political-econ-us-mil.html)
complex. A soldier on foot shooting a rifle is chump change. That
won't move the stock value at all. You need to rely on big ticket
items, like a BOMB. They will move the dial.

Revisionist Zionists have a real hard-on for that al-Aqsa Mosque don't
they..? They want to destroy it, bomb it, and rebuild their temple in
its place.

There is an improved version of the Ukraine map shared earlier
allowing comparison between any two dates. Members and long-time
readers can find that on my primary site.

There is the occasional support for Israel in the odd developing
country, but that likely has to do with weapon purchases than anything
else. The US laws that prohibits sale of certain weapons to certain
countries can be by-passed by selling those weapons to Israel who
promptly resells them to the prohibited country.

I worked at an customer analytics project, pre-911, our team bought
personal data from Experian. The info was at some incredible
detail. >300 million US/Canada citizens. We received it, and put it on
an external hard drive, it sat there on our desk, getting connected to
occasionally, it is still hilarious to think bunch of programmers at a
private firm took that from another private firm, with no checks or
balances whatsoever. Now such data hoarding is a cottage industry.

Experian is a criminally negligient 'credit bureau' that hoovers up
personal information, sells it, and lets identity thieves easily steal
'your' account. There is absolutely no accountability because Congress
doesn't give a damn -- and Experian blatantly doesn't give a damn"

Arab News: "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak brought back former
leader David Cameron as foreign minister on Monday..  The return of
Cameron suggested Sunak wanted to bring in more centrist, experienced
hands rather than appease the right of his party which supported
Braverman"

Reuters: "UK's Sunak brings back Cameron, sacks Braverman"

The Independent: "[11/11] Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley
resisted pressure from senior Tories to ban a pro-Palestinian
demonstration on Saturday, prompting Home Secretary Suella Braverman
to write an article for The Times which made allegations of police
bias over the protests"
