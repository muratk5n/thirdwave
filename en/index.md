Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

2 hydrogen stations for their fleet"

H2 View: "Australia‚Äôs Provaris Energy has launched a floating gaseous
hydrogen storage solution, designed to hold 300 to 600 tonnes of
hydrogen at a fraction of the cost of onshore infrastructure.. Dubbed
H2Leo, the solution has already received an Approval in Principle
(AiP) from the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) and is hoped to
provide the global hydrogen industry with an energy efficient and
cost-effective storage solution. Targeted to cost $0.2-0.3m per tonne
of hydrogen ($200-300/kg hydrogen) Provaris says H2Leo will make the
storage system ‚Äúsignificantly cheaper than onshore solutions.‚Äù

Europe.. Azerbaijan is uniquely equipped to successfully develop a
green hydrogen industry and may soon supply the EU with the
climate-friendly fuel"

China Daily: "Chinese industrial giant CRRC Corp Ltd, in partnership
with Chengdu Rail Transit, introduced a new zero-emissions passenger
train powered by hydrogen in February. The new train offers a travel
range of 600 kilometers and is the fastest to date, with a top speed
