Schools clearly bet on the wrong technology - ed solutions need to be
based on true open source. DoEd can buy commodity hardware (cheap as
they will buying in bulk) and keep Ed software as "images" on a DoEd
server. Images are snapshots of a machine that has everything kids
need, you burn this image on each machine, give that to students. A
few visiting gov IT people for each school occasionally can fix issues
as they arise. Do not depend on some questionable bidness "on the
cloud".

"â€˜Chromebook Churnâ€™ report highlights problems of short-lived laptops
in schools Chromebooks are not designed to last...Schools have piles
of working Chromebooks that have become e-waste because theyâ€™ve
expired...

Chromebooks have a built-in 'death date,' after which software support
ends. We expect milk to expire, but not laptops. Adding to customer
confusion, expiration dates are based on the certification of a given
model, not the purchase date. This means that consumers or schools can
buy a used or refurbished Chromebook thinking theyâ€™re getting a great
deal, only to be surprised when their new laptop expires after a year"

Browser side programs are usually in Javascript. But Imma test a new
tech - Python in the browser \#PyScript.

A lot can be done via static files, even big ones. Some do not realize
but client can even read *parts* of a file on the web server, it's part
of the standard,

```python
from requests import get
url = "http://download.thinkbroadband.com/5MB.zip"
get(url, headers={"Range": "bytes=0-100"})
```

That gets only first 100 bytes. In theory one could even read parts of
a whole database if client knew how to seek/jump between the right
parts of the db file.. This is for read-only apps sure, still,
covers a lot of ground.

---

No need for a whole app server to offer search, static files can work
too (this blog's setup). IDEA: Create a search index offline, push the
index files on the the static site, client, with its code, can read
specific parts of the index, combine, sort them, and present results
on its end.

The hell with this "cloud".. Another dependency will be removed.. Time
to DIY

WTF happened to site search? Place search box on your page, connect to
ext search (Goog) showed search results for that site. Now bust.

"[Clean Energy Latin America's] LCoH Brazil Index reveals that it is
currently feasible to manufacture green hydrogen in select strategic
locations within Brazil at a levelized cost ranging from $2.87/kg to
3.56/kg. However, with optimization and incentives, these costs could
potentially decrease to as low as 1.69 dollar/kg, making them highly
competitive when compared to gray hydrogen derived from fossil fuels,
known for its environmental impact"

Ars Technica: "Chrome's invasive new ad platform, ridiculously branded
the 'Privacy Sandbox,' is.. getting a widespread rollout in Chrome
today. If you haven't been following this, this feature will track the
web pages you visit and generate a list of advertising topics that it
will share with web pages whenever they ask, and it's built directly
into the Chrome browser.. Google seemingly knows this won't be
popular. Unlike the glitzy front-page Google blog post that the
redesign got, the big ad platform launch announcement is tucked away
on the privacysandbox.com page"

Interesting Eng: "First liquid hydrogen-powered piloted plane soars
into sky.. H2FLY, the Stuttgart-based firm acquired by Joby Aviation
in 2021, completed four such flights in its HY4 demonstrator aircraft
fitted with a cutting-edge hydrogen-electric fuel cell propulsion
system and cryogenically stored liquid hydrogen..

Replacing gaseous hydrogen with liquid hydrogen effectively doubled
the maximum range of the HY4 aircraft from around 466 miles (750 km)
to approximately 932 miles (1,500 km), showing great promise for a
future with cleaner and more sustainable air travel"
