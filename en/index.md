I genuinely never thought I would see the day. Literally just 11 years
ago, one of the first papers I ever had published was through ACM, and
if I had wanted it to be open access, it would have cost *$1500.* To
an adjunct junior academic, you might as well be asking for a
kidney. This is genuinely huge"

Communications ACM: "CACM Is Now Open Access.. More than six decades
of CACM’s renowned research articles, seminal papers, technical
reports, commentaries, real-world practice, and news articles are now
open to everyone, regardless of whether they are members of ACM or
subscribe to the ACM Digital Library"

It's not just abt the exec surely, let's not forget the Congress,
numbers there need to increase..

DJT 16-20 at least changed the discussion, challenged parts of the
global capitalism (unfettered access to cheap labor at home
-migration- and abroad -globalisation-), questioned NATO, indirectly
militarism. He beat a Clinton and a Bush, we should all be grateful
for that. But we cannot expect an FDR like figure from the Republican
party.. Democrats, or another party, will have to do the bulk of the
work.

Zucman: "In 2018, for the first time in the last hundred years, the
top 400 richest Americans have paid lower tax rates than the working
class.. This looks like the tax system of a plutocracy. With tax rates
of barely 20% at the top, wealth will keep accumulating with hardly
any barrier. And with that, so too will the power of the wealthy
accumulate, including their ability to shape policymaking and
government for their own benefit..

It’s always possible to shrug off the risk of an entrenched
plutocracy. To believe that whether a few super-rich own a large
fraction of the country’s wealth is irrelevant. That America’s
institutions are so strong that they cannot be captured by special
interests. That from Boston to Los Angeles, democracy will always and
forever beat plutocracy. And certainly, democracy has overcome
plutocracy in the past. It triumphed over the slaveholding plutocracy
of the South. It beat back the nascent industrialist plutocracy of the
Gilded Age. In one case it took a war; in the other a tax revolution"

@tilde I still think the modus operandi we named capitalism in
economics, we’d call parasitic in biology"

Capitalism interprets resilience as inefficiency and tries to erode
it. Capitalism will not stop until every aspect of society is so
'just-in-time' that an unexpected stiff breeze causes widespread
shortages."

To capitalism, sustainability always looks like underutilization"

H2 Central: "Thiozen, the first company ever to produce clean hydrogen
from 'sour gas' waste streams, today announced that it has received
$1.18 million in grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation
(NSF) to help the company commercialize its breakthrough technology
that replaces traditional hydrogen production methods"

Wired: "Amazon has become the second company ever to have its
lobbyists banned from the European Parliament, amid accusations that
the company does not take the institution seriously"

Brookings: "Saudi Arabia has spent a fortune buying arms from America
to prosecute [the war in Yemen].. In the five years before the war,
U.S. arms transfers to Saudi Arabia amounted to $3 billion; between
2015 and 2020, the U.S. agreed to sell over 64.1 billion worth of
weapons to Riyadh, averaging 10.7 billion per year..
