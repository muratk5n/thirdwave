Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Here is Lerner on TBB; he is right, many recent 'fairy dust'

'Do not fully understand' is right, as in, *it never happened*.

National Geographic: "A star cluster some 80,000 light-years from
Earth looks mysteriously deficient in [rare earth which] suggests that
astrophysicists either don't fully understand the big bang, they
suggest, or else don't fully understand the way that stars work"

Gizmodo: "[2012] Hubble has spotted an ancient galaxy that shouldn't
exist.. This galaxy is so large, so fully-formed, astronomers say it
shouldn't exist at all. It's called a "grand-design" spiral galaxy,
