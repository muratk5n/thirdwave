European Court of Justice was one of the things the Brexiters whined
about the most, because remember, they wanted to "take back their
freedom" and not be subject to opressive European laws through ECJ
enforcement.

But I bet their whining wasn't as much about taking back their local
independence but about wanting to keep using this ICSID system where,
I suspect, Anglo companies are favored more. IOW Brexiters wanted to
go back to the shady multinational system they helped found where
their rich feel more "at home", rather than be more equal terms with
their European neighbors.
