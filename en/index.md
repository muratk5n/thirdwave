H2 Europe: "German asset manager KGAL has invested an undisclosed
amount into a proposed green hydrogen project with up to 1,050MW of
electrolyser capacity in the municipality of Lubmin, on Germany’s
northeastern coast. The plant’s developers, GP Joule and PtX
Development — the latter of which has already secured a site — plan to
initially install 210MW of electrolysers in the first phase, although
a timeline for scale-up to more than 1GW of capacity has not been
disclosed"

H2 Central: "Uruguay readies offshore wind licence for green hydrogen
production.. Uruguay’s state-owned energy company Ancap may soon grant
concessions on four offshore blocks to produce green hydrogen as the
country seeks to position itself as a 'global exporter'"

Officially I'll stick to the original prediction... I'm using polling
data to gauge a lower bound on Dem campaigning, meh, not terrible so
far. Combined, let's still say Kamaller, I'll eat crow if it goes the
other way.

If we negate the incumb adv for Dems, their chance for win is,

```
Interval: [42.95 50.51] Average: 46.73
```

Most likely a loss.

Should Trump be seen as an incumbent? He did not get his chance for a
second term, he is running for that now, just like an incumbent
would. Since 2020 was such a confusing time, a chaos, squint a little,
it could look like two incumbents are running against each other. That
would change the outcome of the Abramovitz formula.

Theory of Everything attempts keep falling short bcz the previous
layer(s) have faults. We should not delude ourselves thinking the WWI
generation had everything figured out. Yankee sci culture is too
insecure to go there, US led sci consensus keeps trying to maintain
the foundational layer and somehow "connect stuff on top" and have
their grand theory. Everything is a f-ing mess and this modern
consensus is to blame. Just look at international relations and
project that onto science. Same dipshittery everywhere, with the same
sad result.

Good point by Marmet.. you can come up with eqns that fit the data,
but are those the right equations that explain the reality that
produce that data?

Einstein was wrong

Paul Marmet: "Many experiments, like the Michelson-Morley and Sagnac
experiments and others, are testing the fundamental nature of
light. It is conflicting to observe that the velocity of photons is
measured as a constant, when the observer moves away from that light
source. Since all other particles are measured with additive
velocities ($V-v$) or ($V+v$) with respect to a moving frame, why can
photons not obey that same rule?  Since Newton's mechanics has shown
that all relative velocities produce a Doppler frequency shift, we
must expect that some special phenomena prevent us from detecting the
real change of relative velocity. It is quite incorrect to believe
that this phenomenon cannot be explained using physical reality and
Newton physics.  As required by the principle of mass-energy
conservation, the atoms (nucleus and electrons) forming the local
standard reference meter and the moving clock have acquired some extra
mass due to the materialization of kinetic energy. Quantum mechanics
shows that this increase of energy changes the de Broglie electron
wavelength and consequently, the Bohr radius and the clock rate. It is
surprising to find new hypotheses like space-time distortion, and even
more, the suggestion of 'new logic' to explain these observations,
while it is not taken into account that the rate of the moving clock
is naturally modified due to the increase of mass (following the
absorption of kinetic energy). The simple application of the principle
of mass-energy conservation explains naturally all these experiments..
We must recall that an empirical equation used to predict the outcome
of a physical system is *not an explanation*"

Puerto Rico was clearly invaded by US corporate power..

Kinzer, *Overthrow, US' Century of Regime Change*: "During the early
years of the twentieth century, four American corporations gobbled up
most of Puerto Rico's best land. On it they planted sugar, a crop
suited to large-scale farming. The big losers were families who grew
coffee, which is known as the 'poor man's crop' because it can be
cultivated on small plots. By 1930, sugar accounted for 60 percent of
the country's exports, while coffee, once the island's principal crop,
had fallen to just 1 percent... With little access to land, ordinary
Puerto Ricans became steadily poorer. One study found that while 17
percent of them were unemployed at the time of the American invasion,
30 percent were unemployed a quarter century later"

Al-Monitor: "Dead end'? US shows lack of leverage as Israel pounds
Lebanon.. For nearly a year, one of..  Biden's top priorities has been
to prevent the Gaza war from spiraling into an all-out regional
conflict. Weeks ahead of an election -- and just as Biden begins his
farewell visit to the UN General Assembly -- Israel is pounding
Lebanon, killing hundreds and highlighting the powerlessness of his
warnings"
