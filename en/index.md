In the lands they migrated to later, such as the US, they were
assimilated just like Irish, Polish, Africans had been and became
natives after one generation. It is all about the mainstream culture -
heritage means nothing.

Palestinian leader Abbas' claims were not baseless. Isaac Asimov wrote
in his biography *It's Been a Good Life* he himself might not be
connected to ancient Israel at all. East European Jews are mostly from
today's southern Russia, and they took up Judaism as the state
religion "[probably] to keep from falling under the influence of
either the Byzantine Christians or the Arab Moslems, who were busily
engaged in the first part of their centuries-long duel". Theirs was a
tactical conversion, had no relation to the Middle East, therefore
their descendants' Semitic connection would be in question. People who
arrived into modern Israel have grandiose claims that aren't
correct. Their grandfathers [did not](2020/06/10-myths-israel.html#samejew)
"leave the ancient lands" so their descendants are not "coming back" to
anything..  They are pretenders, squatters in a land that was never theirs.

Do you prefer your shelves empty, or under lock and key (the latter
obviously being sign of inequality). Could there be a system where
shelves are somewhat full, and people are not looting?

There were claims back in 2022 MM was mad at the admin on the Ukraine policy and [leaked](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/10/us/politics/biden-ukraine-russia-diplomacy.html)
to NYT about his own position.. That could be true - but the admin
itself could have told Milley to leak so that outside observers would
know gov is hearing all viewpoints, in a way to quell fears they
weren't completely gung-ho.

You see who calls the shots in US, business wants cheap workers they
get cheap workers. They turned politicians into their bitch. And as
long as there is demand for cheap labor, people will keep coming.

Gaetz says some Reps for E-verify changed their minds within a day, he
supports it even against big business, the measure will help US
workers. That makes sense.

Shared a 7m sea level rise simulation before, that NY area under water
now in Brooklyn is [in red](mbl/2023/searise2.jpg). If a place can get
flooded by extreme water events today, after sea rises it will remain
flooded for good. Flooding today is a sign of permanent burial
tomorrow.  Heed the warning and bolt.

Huge storm and flooding in NYC today. This is 4th Ave and Carroll St
