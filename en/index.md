Hackaday: "[A] team from ETH Zurich [..is] using [H2] to reduce iron
oxide to iron, which can easily release the hydrogen by oxidation with
water. Their reactor is simplicity itself, a large stainless steel
tank filled with powdered iron ore. Pump hydrogen into it and the iron
oxide in the ore becomes water and iron which forms the storage
medium, and retrieve the hydrogen later by piping steam through the
mixture. Hydrogen generated in the summer using solar power can then
be released in the winter months"

Original religions are left-wing, they are also pre-agro, pro-forager
which implies most of our left-wing impulses can also be traced back
to the forager. And this is in fact true. Pre-agro human was not
hierarchical, practiced ownership but did not accumulate stuff (could
not, given the nature of his/her methods of production), they were not
patriarchal, the relationship between the sexes were not strict,
combative and/or compartmentalized. Everyone could get food via
hunting, everyone had shelter, they worked 20 hours a week.

It makes sense religion appealed, invoked the wilderness loving part
in us, because all religions are political movements that rebel
against systems which themselves are founded on organized
agriculture. Wilderness = forager, post forager = farming (farming
displaced, replaced foragers as history tells us). Organized agro
means static farmer, empires (who tax them), war, disease, death, and
all the ills that come with it.

Some religions even tried to create rules that were in line with the
forager; fasting simulates the life of a hunter-gatherer - sometimes
there is no food, sometimes there is lots of food. "Always having
food" is a foreign concept for us, biologically, which was only made
possible after farming came into the scene. But in essence, due to our
biology, we are not used to this modern situation. Some religions
bring that back, for short periods.

RFK Jr: "The central revelation of every one of th[e major] religions
always occurred in the wilderness.. Moses had to go into that
wilderness to listen, to hear God's voice and see the burning bush. He
had to go to the wilderness at Mount Sinai to get the
commandments. Muhammad was a city boy from Mecca, had to go to the
wilderness and Mount Harar on a camping trip, with its kids and
wrestle the angel Gabriel in the middle of the night, and have the
first suras of the Koran [delivered to] him. Buddha had to go into the
wilderness, wander for years, and then sit under the bodhi tree to get
his first revelation of nirvana. And Christ had to spend 40 days in
the wilderness to discover its divinity for the first time. And his
mentor was John the Baptist, who lived in a cave in the Jordan Valley,
and ate honey of wild bees and locusts. All of Christ's parables come
from nature. I'm the vine. You are the branch mustard seed, the little
swallows, the scattering seeds on the ground, because that is where we
center the divine. God talks to us through the fishes, the birds, the
leaves. They're all words from our creator"

Jalopnik: "A SpaceX rocket booster crashed as it was landing
Wednesday.. The Federal Aviation Administration has since grounded all
Falcon 9 rockets until an investigation into the crash is
completed... [the crash could] delay the planned February mission to
rescue the two astronauts stranded on board the International Space
Station"

You can't trust SpaceX to send/rescue astronauts either."

Hey anything is possible, but an attack at the scale of 9/11 would not
be something a state would overtly or covertly support. If it was ever
found out, the response would be severe... No state can take that
risk.

---

The claim is Russians were behind 9/11?.. Interesting scenario but
unlikely.. the plane attack idea wasn't exactly new, in fact Tom
Clancy used the idea as a plot device in one of his fiction books.

The Hill: "[2022/10] In 1987, GRU (the military counterpart of the KGB)
defector Vladimir Rezun (aka, Viktor Suvorov), laid out a scenario:
two successive plane crashes into the White House, the second one
timed to obliterate the first responders and command structure who
arrived the scene after the first crash. In 1997, having spent six
months in Russia, al-Zawahiri decamped to Afghanistan, becoming Osama
bin Laden’s lieutenant and mastermind of 9/11"
