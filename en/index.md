Cetta, de la Pena: "This paper provides elements in support of the
random zero-point radiation field (ZPF) as an essential ontological
ingredient needed to explain distinctive properties of
quantum-mechanical systems. We show that when an otherwise classical
particle is connected to the ZPF, a drastic, qualitative change in the
dynamics takes place, leading eventually to the quantum dynamics...

[An] inspection of the current literature readily reveals the
existence of about two dozen different interpretations of QM, some
more popular than others, and none of them experimentally
verified. How can it be that a fundamental theory that provides the
basis for a most significant part of contemporary physics, admits such
a variety of alternative, even contradictory interpretations? No
serious physicist or philosopher of science in his five senses would
claim to come up with a better interpretation of Newtonian mechanics
or Maxwellian electrodynamics. Reformulations of a known accepted
theory may appear, of course, but fundamental theories do not accept
reinterpretations. Special relativity did not reinterpret classical
mechanics, it extended mechanics to wider domains, and together with
quantum theory helped to specify its range of applicability. We should
conclude that in the case of quantum mechanics, such variety of
interpretations is indicative of a crucial underdetermination of the
theory...

[To] understand the origin of so many different visions about the same
fundamental theory, it is convenient to place ourselves in the context
in which QM was born. We recall that the quantum formalism—its
excellent mathematical apparatus that we still use today with
success—was born in the absence of a deep understanding of the quantum
phenomenology...

It is against this background that Heisenberg worked on his version of
the theory, the matrix mechanics. Heisenberg discovered that the
quantum particles have an unavoidable random behavior. Being persuaded
of the completeness of his theory, he took this randomness for an
essential, irreducible trait that neither needs nor admits a deeper
explanation...

Unknowingly, Schrödinger’s wave theory implied the introduction of a
new element into the quantum description. The point is that electron
interference patterns are produced by the accumulation of a high
number of point-like events, each one created by a single electron. A
single particle produces an isolated, randomly located bright point on
the detecting screen, the interference—the wave manifestation—becoming
evident only after very many hits. The conclusion—normally one that
goes unnoticed—is that Schrödinger’s wave function refers not to a
single particle, but to an ensemble of them. Well interpreted,
Schrödinger theory is intrinsically statistical in nature, and deals
with ensembles rather than individual particles.  Nevertheless, the
statistical perspective of the quantum phenomenon was dismissed in
general—and adamantly opposed by the Copenhagen school in particular,
which prevails to date under different guises.. This opened the door
to another infelicitous ingredient, the observer. The introduction of
an active character in order to ’explain’ the reduction of the
distinctive quantum mixtures to the pure states observed, added a
subjective ingredient to the already odd quantum scheme.  All in all,
such variety of interpretations and re-interpretations indicates that
something of importance is missing in the theory. Having so many
variations indicates that the issue is actually not one of
interpretation, but of an essential incompleteness. The absence of an
appropriate guiding ontological element has turned the physical
situation into a mystery...

However, rather than [an] incompletenesses.. we are referring to an
essential ingredient that is missing. The point is that whatever is to
be added to the incomplete theoretical framework should be able to
address simultaneously some of its main puzzles, including not just
the nature of quantum fluctuations; atomic stability, quantum
transitions, discrete atomic spectra, wavelike phenomena and the like
should find their natural explanation in a coherent scheme.

The present paper is one of a series that deals with the development
of stochastic electrodynamics (SED) as a physical foundation for
quantum mechanics. In previous work we have shown that, by including
the zero-point radiation field (ZPF), SED allows us to arrive at a
consistent description of the stationary states and to derive the
(nonrelativistic) radiative corrections proper for QED"

I see CNBC shared a list of reactors under construction, but we have
to stress HTR-PM in China, HTTR in Japan, HTGR-POLA in Poland in the
list are all helium-cooled reactors. So the main feature of these
reactors is not they are small, they are *cooled differently* which
gives them additional safety features. Proper detail was not provided
in this article.
