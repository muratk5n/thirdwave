According to Andersen's [great work](2023/06/evil-geniuses.html) low
taxes on the rich and unregulated business and weak unions and a weak
federal government "were portrayed as the only ways back to some kind
of rugged, frontiersy, stronger, better America", and "a winsome 1950s
actor in a cowboy hat" was the frontman for that sale. There aren't
that many Western movies now.. I wonder what replaced them as a
marketing vehicle for this "frontier mentality".. Superhero movies
maybe..? Look at Batman - he is like Ronald Reagan with a hero
suit. He seems to inhabit a non-governmental world where he "fights
bad people" whenever he wants, without asking the government. A
crime-fighting enterpreneur.. A disruptor. Sometimes the movies touch
the subject of vigilantism / government explicitly of course, but
maybe they "put a hat on it", making the propaganda into a story so
they can continue the propaganda.

What is wrong with those extra 9 people in US? They likely have
psychological problems, they don't want to help anyone, just like to
order people around, want workers around to fetch them coffee put a
stupid hat on during "Christmas sale". Coo-coo

The number in Ireland, Japan sounds normal. You dont want too much
enterpreneurship.

"Enterpreneurs in US is 1 in 10, in Ireland and Japan it is 1 in 100"

Because this suboptimal idea was promoted by the First Black
President™, it became Democrat canon, part of the party plank (Bam
had to have contributed something legendary, something with a big L
legacy), from there MSM dipshits with zero critical thinking ability
parroted the idea, and since other countries of the world copy US for
any tech fashion, they went along, and if there is demand, China will
build it which they did. This is how we ended up here. Cascading
foolishness, made in America.

"Batteries being built in China" is not a good criticism of this tech.
The real problem is that batteries are being built at all.

---

It's true.. that's why battery-electric flight is impractical too, the
battery weighs too much. 

Nikki Haley: "Electric vehicles are heavy, our roads and bridges wouldn't be
able to handle that weight"

Still double-digit lead for Trump there
