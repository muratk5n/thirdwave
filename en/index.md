"End welfare as we know it!". "The era of big goverment is over!".
I think it's your legacy that is over, poser fool.

Vox: "[2016] 'If the goal was to get rid of poverty, we failed': the
legacy of the 1996 welfare reform.. Ten years after signing the bill,
[Clinton] took an enthusiastic victory lap in the pages of the New
York Times. 'Welfare reform has proved a great success,' he
declared... But another 10 years later, the mood.. changed.. New
research had showed that in fact welfare reform fell short in the
depths of the Great Recession — substantially increasing deep poverty
and leaving families who can’t find work without any cash safety net"

The Obamas are on their 3rd, 4th *château* now..? Black Bill Clinton
gives them valuable speeches too, the business community must really
like. But the Obamas are fine... they need to "represent", we'll turn
a blind eye to that.  Bama is not doing anything his patron saint Bill
would not do anyway...

CNN: "[2016/02] Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill
Clinton, combined to earn more than $153 million in paid speeches from
2001 until Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign last
spring, a CNN analysis shows... In total, the two gave 729 speeches
from February 2001 until May, receiving an average payday of 210,795
dollar for each address. The two also reported at least 7.7 million
for at least 39 speeches to big banks, including Goldman Sachs and
UBS, with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic 2016 front-runner,
collecting at least 1.8 million for at least eight speeches to big
banks"

Speaking fees are a form of corruption.. While in office pol executes
pro corporate policies that benefit a business, after leaving office
gets invited by that same business to give "speeches" with a price tag
upwards of a quarter mil..  No one gives speeches that valuable.. but
the *value* was delivered beforehand, while in office. Now corrupt
politician gets paid in kind.

Robert Solow: "You see the computer age everywhere but in the
productivity statistics."

The IT revolution wasn't much of a revolution. It ended up being fairy
dust on the existing system, inequalities remained the same, and some
became entrenched because of a new group that gained "class
conciousness" and captured a big chunk of the Democratic party. The
shine really started to come off when the "Twitter Revolution" went
bust in lands of Arab Spring, and with meager growth in the developed
world it became clear tech was not driving anything except a phony
rise in stock prices. Krugman was right on this one, as far as output
is concerned, "the Internet's impact on the economy has been no
greater than the fax machine". There is a spiffy "web site" for health
insurance, yet 85 million people in US are uninsured or
underinsured. What did the tech deliver? Nothing except an illusion,
the mirage of progress.

Bill Clinton is the figure to destroy because he was the first prez
elected after the fall of Berlin Wall, at the same time an IT
"revolution" of sorts took place seemingly confirming the "vision" of
these fucktards, the followers of Gary Hart. The wall fell, and
everything that followed was assumed to be "the new world order", a
bizarre concoction of anti-worker, pro-capital, globalisation-ran-wild
sentiment/politics... All of that culminated in Bill presidency and
most Dems afterwards adapted this blueprint. Sadly, the approach, and
the man had glaring deficiencies. Dems need to remove this fudge from
their collective worldview, as the eclectic ideo clearly, visibly
stopped working. Dems who followed it just lost a key
demographic. Somebody needs to pay the price for that.

I have to admit until *Peacemaker* I liked nothing Gunn had ever
done.. But a lot of ppl like his movies so I relied on others' views
in further commentary (you need these tricks when you are an
all-around shoot-the-shit commentator like me, to remain
objective). PM showed me personally he could actually pull off a
grander project. From DCEU perspective a lot hinges on the new SM, it
is supposed to kick off a whole new cinematic universe.

Great, Gunn federated his Threads, can now follow him on
Mastodon. JG is the director currently working on the new Supes movie,
the reboot.

"@jamesgunn@threads.net

Sam McCurdy won a well-deserved Emmy for his cinematography on Shogun
- now he’s here killing it on Peacemaker."
