The EV Report: "Hyzon Motors Inc., a leader in high-power hydrogen
fuel cell technology, has successfully completed its first commercial
demonstration of a liquid hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle (LH2
FCEV)...

- The LH2 FCEV trial began in Temple, TX and covered over 540 miles
during a 16-hour continuous run, delivering to eight PFG customers
near Dallas, TX.

- The vehicle operated under strenuous conditions, including
temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit, proving the feasibility
of liquid hydrogen in real-world applications.

- Liquid hydrogen offers several advantages over its gaseous form,
including higher energy density and no added weight to the vehicle.

- The proprietary 200kW fuel cell system developed by Hyzon Motors is
expected to provide a driving range between 650 and 800 miles,
comparable to many diesel trucks.

- Chart Industries designed a specialized tank system to store liquid
hydrogen at extreme cold temperatures, as low as negative 400 degrees
Fahrenheit, while maintaining necessary pressure levels"

Anglo-Australian mining company Rio Tinto is building four calcifiers
using #hydrogen as fuel in their Yarwun in Gladstone, Queensland,
Australia.

Rio Tinto partnered with Sumitomo Corporation and the Australian
Renewable Energy Agency for the project.

The new plant will include a 2.5MW on-site electrolyzer to produce
\#greenhydrogen to supply operations.

Construction will start in 2024 and operation in 2025"

How about Peter Thiel and the merry band of cocksuckers around him?
They have some shady dealings.. Thiel himself [reportedly](https://www.propublica.org/article/lord-of-the-roths-how-tech-mogul-peter-thiel-turned-a-retirement-account-for-the-middle-class-into-a-5-billion-dollar-tax-free-piggy-bank)
turned his Roth IRA "into a gargantuan tax-exempt piggy bank".
Thiel's [bestie](mbl/2022/ejagoffthiel2.jpeg) is neck deep in all kinds of
[fraud](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/),
not to mention involvement in dysfuctional battery-electric tech.
