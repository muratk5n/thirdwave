Dampier: "Among the fatal flaws in the Telecom Act of 1996 were its
various ‘competition tests,’ which were open to considerable
interpretation and latitude at the FCC. The Republican supporters of
the bill argued that the presence of an open and free marketplace
would, by itself, induce competition among various entrants. They were
generally unconcerned with the question of whether new competition
would actually arrive. Their priority was lifting the protective
levers of legacy regulation as soon as possible. Many Democrats
assumed what appeared to be carefully drafted regulatory language
would protect consumers by preventing the FCC from lifting protections
too early in the competitive process. But lobbyists consistently
outmaneuvered lawmakers, finding ways to insert loopholes and
compromise language that introduced inconsistencies that could be
dealt with and eliminated either by the FCC or the courts later...

The first warning the 1996 Act was going awry came a year after the
bill was signed into law. Phone companies started raising rates from
1.50 - 6 dollars a month on average. AT&T was petitioning to hike
rates $7 a month. Someone would have to pay to replace the scrapped
subsidy system in a competitive market — subsidies that had been in
place at the nation’s phone companies for decades. By charging higher
rates for phone service in cities and for pricier long distance calls
before the arrival of companies like MCI and Sprint, the phone
companies used this revenue to subsidize their Universal Service
obligations, keeping rural phone bills low and often below the real
cost of providing service. To establish a truly competitive phone
business, the subsidies had to be reformed or go, and that meant
someone had to cover the difference"

Dampier: "[Clinton's] Telecom Act of 1996 Sowed the Seeds of a Telecom
Oligopoly.. How exactly did America get stuck with a broadband
monopoly in many areas, a duopoly in most others? It did not happen by
accident.. By understanding the trickery and legislative shell games
practiced by lobbyists and their elected partners in Congress, you
will learn to recognize when the telecom industry and their friends
are preparing to sell you another bill of goods"

US gave it to the French and Brits, the French gave it to Israel,
Russia stole it from the Americans, then gave it to China,
India. China gave the tech to Pakistan to balance out
India. Reportedly Pakistan recently told Anatolians ("Turks") here you
take nuke tech from us to be used against Israelis, you bomb the
muckers so it's not on us. An extreme scenario surely.

AFAIK unless the original research at Los Alamos is passed down onto a
country, that country is not able to create a nuclear weapon.. They
made a key finding at that lab that is crucial to get the thing to
function. Other countries have built nukes independently but they
never truly seem to work because they are missing that key piece. I
believe North Korea, Iran's programs are not functional, not at weapon
grade level. But of course Russia can just give the tech to them, just
like they gave it to China and India.

Firspost: "Zelenskyy’s visit to the US did not sit well with the
Republicans as the party’s presidential nominee slammed the
comedian-turned-politician. After former US President Donald Trump
lambasted Zelenskyy and claimed that he is 'refusing' to negotiate a
peace deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin, US House Speaker
Mike Johnson condemned the Ukrainian leader’s visit to a munitions
factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania"

I've checked the Sudan RSF / SAF frontline, there's been no notable
changes for over a month. A little RSF gain around Al Madina Arab,
some loss in Wad an Nail, gain SE Shukri. That's it. This conflict is
frozen.
