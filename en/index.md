NPR: "[2013] There's a saying in Mexico: *Sin maiz, no hay pais*: no
corn, no country. Mexico is where corn originated, and it's the food
staple most people depend on. It's what Antonio Pena grew on his
family farm in Guanajuato in Central Mexico...

The Mexican government used to subsidize corn. It kept the crop price
high so small farmers could stay in business. And it kept tortilla
prices low so poor people could eat. When NAFTA took effect two
decades ago, the trade agreement phased out tariffs in order to lower
costs and encourage investment between the U.S., Canada and
Mexico. The Mexican government ended its corn subsidy..

Seventy-five thousand Iowa farmers grew twice as much corn as three
million Mexican farmers at half the cost. U.S. corn flooded Mexico. An
estimated two million Mexican farm workers in general left the
countryside for big cities. Antonio Pena was one of them... Then, like
millions more Mexicans, he crossed illegally into the U.S."

The Asashi Shukimbun: "The Japan Atomic Energy Agency said it plans to
start producing clean hydrogen using heat from its High Temperature
Engineering Test Reactor (HTTR) in Ibaraki Prefecture close to Tokyo
by 2028..

The national nuclear research and development agency is hoping to
start producing hydrogen at the HTTR, an experimental high-temperature
gas-cooled reactor (HTGR), in the second half of fiscal 2028. There
are hopes that HTGRs can produce hydrogen in voluminous amounts on a
stable basis because heat at higher temperatures can be extracted from
an HTGR compared with a light-water reactor, which is the mainstream
nuclear reactor"

The European Commission finds Apple’s Core Technology Fee is against
the law. It's also too onerous on developers, and too complicated for
users, and Apple has not proved these measures are just and
valid. Apple now has a chance to defend its reasoning before a final
ruling on fines & consequences"

AAah now we find out why they included the scene. It's anti-deportation,
pro-open-border propaganda. No wonder the show sucks.

The Holywood Reporter: "Andor dared to go to the darkest places Star
Wars could offer. An Imperial Officer abusing his untouchable status
to [abuse] an undocumented migrant, while his troops are rounding up
other undocumented citizens. This is the real world seeping into Star
Wars storytelling; this is the world WE live in, reflected in the
galaxy far, far away, this is Star Wars at its most political, its
most potent"

There was a scene in ep 3 where an imperial officer abused a woman?

Watched one ep, it still sucks

New *Andor* season..?

The Guardian: "The world’s coral reefs have been pushed into
“uncharted territory” by the worst global bleaching event on record
that has now hit more than 80% of the planet’s reefs, scientists have
warned.

Reefs in at least 82 countries and territories have been exposed to
enough heat to turn corals white since the global event started in
January 2023, the latest data from the US government’s Coral Reef
Watch shows"

All near the fault line.. Nothing to worry about. All dandy.

```python
fl = u.get_json().loads(open("tr_faultline1.json").read())
u.map_coords(dfq, lines=fl, zoom=9, outfile="map07.html")
```

There's been much talk about "the big one" that is predicted to hit
Stanpoli at some point. Are these the signs of the big one?

Homie got shook?

```python
dfq = u.eq_at(41, 29, 500, 3); u.map_coords(dfq, zoom=9, outfile="map06.html")
