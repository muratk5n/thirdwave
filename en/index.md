McManus: "One of the sad truths about American socialist writers
post-1980 is they’ve struggled to reach a wide audience (despite the
fact that there are plenty of societal conditions to be unhappy about,
which could be used to spark a reader’s interest in alternatives to
capitalism). This is in part due to the sheer ideological clout and
vast resources poured into defending neoliberal capitalism at the
climax of the Cold War and after it. This effort was so pervasive that
even many leftists became closet Fukuyamaists, convinced we had
reached 'the end of history.' (As the idea went, after the fall of
Communism, there was simply no better kind of society that could be
envisioned other than Western liberal democracy.)

But.. this failure was also partially a result of the socialist left
retreating into intellectual, artistic, and academic spaces in the
aftermath of failed ’60s radicalism. One consequence of this is that
socialists tended to adopt the tone, style, and expectations aligned
with those communities: writing for a select audience that valued
dense intellectualism, self-conscious novelty, and insular
referentiality over more democratic and popular styles"

"@LilMissBarbie

Bitch the fuck?

It's ILLEGAL to build sidewalks or pedestrian spaces in murica?

You guys killed the natives for that?"

"@NoMansSkyWasAlright

I had a similar thought when I was at the Opryland resort for a
conference. Like, you go outside and it's parking lot as far as the
eye can see (that's a bit of an exaggeration. But was able to do my
morning 3 mile runs without ever leaving the parking lot) but the
inside is this super nice, walkable, "outside inside" place. It would
be kind of cool if we could build places like that in the US"

"@PulmonaryEmphysema

Yup. Same thing in Canada. Zoning laws actively make this impossible
to build. Funnily enough, building more strip malls with 5 acres of
asphalt per store is totally A-ok"

---

"@definitely_not

Yep, midrise mixed use developments with minimal parking are not legal
to build anywhere in most cities in the US, and where they are
allowed, are strictly limited"

"@twoiko

Big business does tho"

"@ArticleEcstatic1448

In America, nobody wins"

"GUlysses@reddit

Most true in Orlando and Vegas. Also San Antonio. The Riverwalk is the
most popular tourist destination in Texas. Americans will eat at
overpriced chain restaurants just to experience some walkability"

---

Julian Briggs: "Las Vegas is so funny because it's just putting
walkable urban spaces from around the worl indoors since it's illegal
to build actual places like this in the US"

Anne Hidalgo: 'Cars Will Not Return To the Eiffel Tower' after the
Olympic Games.

'The Trocadéro will be greened and the Pont d'Iéna pedestrianized, up
to the Champ de Mars, which will be reforested. The whole thing will
form a large park in the heart of Paris'"
