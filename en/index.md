ProPublica: "The story of one #Indiana store demonstrates how the more
than 60,000 gun retailers in America have little financial incentive
to say no to questionable buyers and face limited penalties for
failing to prevent illegal transactions"

JE clearly had an high-end service along the one with young girls..
One-stop shop for the military-industrial-Likud complex (you can bet
your ass JE, Maxwell was theirs, Eps was always througt to be an
asset, the bitch, and her father had long links to intel).

Research emerging detailing the degradation of the GPT-4 model as it
drifts further and further from the training data cut-off... The 'I'
in its 'A.I.'  is human. And when they train GPT-5, it'll be eating
the output of LLMs. Like in Human Centipede. (But not as funny)"

The Intercept: "The US State Department encouraged the Pakistani
government in a March 7, 2022, meeting to remove Imran Khan as prime
minister over his neutrality on the Russian invasion of Ukraine,
according to a classified Pakistani government document.. One month
after the meeting with U.S. officials documented in the leaked
Pakistani government document, a no-confidence vote was held in
Parliament, leading to Khan’s removal from power. The vote is believed
to have been organized with the backing of Pakistan’s powerful
military"

Dersh is a douche.. Has shady connections to the "complex". He was
ambushed recently by a Youtuber, had himself a new asshole torn
up. It was hilarious to watch. Zionist douche.

TDB: "The government of South Africa filed a case in December with the
International Court of Justice in The Hague, accusing Israel of
committing war crimes in Gaza. On Tuesday, it was widely reported that
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wants the lawyer sometimes
known as 'Dersh' to represent Israel at The Hague"

SValley and similar companies are more like the "last mile of tech",
they can only build upon existing research, they need lots of free
stuff made available to them, low hanging fruits so they can pick
those fruits, put them together to create a product as a last mile of
service. We should not expect much from them by way of basic science,
vision and surely not regulatory advice. iPhone would not exist wout
billions of government funded research and existing tech.
