Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Reddit User: "[Answering question 'Why is water see through?'] It's a
little bit backwards. Life needed to be able to see through water, so
it created eyes that could see the light that water was clear to.

That might need some explanation. All things are "clear" to some kinds
of light and "opaque" to other light. Like how an X ray can go right
through your skin and see your bones. It's that way for all light,
including visible light.

So there was always some wavelength of light that made water
"clear". And some of those wavelengths are the visible light spectrum.

So when life evolved in the ocean, and eyes developed, it was very
useful to be able to see the light that could pass through the
water. And so you get eyes that can see in the ocean"

Washington Post: "The underbelly of [battery] electric
vehicles.. [their] production can exact a significant human and
environmental cost. To run, EVs require six times the mineral input,
by weight, of conventional vehicles..

These minerals, including cobalt, nickel, lithium and manganese, are
finite resources. And mining and processing them can be harmful for
workers, their communities and the local environment...

[U]nderneath the floor of your car is an approximately 900-pound
battery block containing materials that have been mined from the
ground, sent around the world and put through complex chemical
processing to fuel your ride from point A to point B. That supply
chain has a significant human and environmental toll"

H2 Fuel News: "Cummins Inc. has announced plans to invest over $1
billion in its US engine manufacturing network for a transition into
hydrogen fuel. The investment will upgrade facilities supporting
‚Äúfuel-agnostic‚Äù engine platforms that operate on low-carbon fuels,
including hydrogen, with the aim of decarbonizing truck and bus fleets
in the US. The company announced that this investment is on top of
those recently made in its Minnesota plant"

Hey thats a great idea.. Dems truly effed it all up on this issue,
especially the Clintons, time to get creative and improve things here
and there.

Hindustan Times: "Over 3,000 guns exchanged for gift cards in a single
day in New York.. Participants were offered $500 gift cards in
exchange for surrendering untraceable "ghost guns" and assault-type
rifles with no questions asked, ABC news reported"

I studied Hinton's, Bengio's Le Cun's work, as it pertains to the
science of intelligence there is nothing there. It's time to bring
back the AI Winter - in fact Hinton seems to be calling for it,
subconciously wanting to be "put out of his misery".

---

He is not the Godfather of AI, he is one of the three people who
brought back the neural net approach to weak AI (ending the so-called
AI Winter which also was about neural nets). The "conspirators" made
NNs "deep" hence the monikor deep neural networks which helped further
their parrot capabilities. That's it. The tech is as parroty as it
was, but now, it can generate better spam. It still can't drive a car
or summarize a text. And it won't get there as long as maintream
remains on this misguided path. They will try bigger "better" neural
nets that will go nowhere just like some physicists want to keep
building bigger and better colliders instead of going back to the
drawing board and fixing their science.

`sudo init 3` can shut off all desktop proc on Linux based board Nano. Handy.
