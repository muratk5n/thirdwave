Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

trucking... A parade of significant hydrogen-related announcements

Long Beach, California, venue. Toyota Motor North America (TMNA),
which doesn’t make commercial trucks, confirmed production later this
year of a heavy-duty fuel cell system at its Kentucky manufacturing

I lived near Hudson River for a while... I joked earlier in other
posts four-eyed fish, one-legged frog etc, those weren't just random
burns, I'd hear that stuff from the natives of the area. RFKj's version
of HR history was interesting - had some successes but ultimately
crony capitalism [won](https://youtu.be/RVOCFci_3rM?t=2428).

Increased cases of astma, autism; industrial polution is to blame? \#RFKJr
It is surprising for foreigners so many ppl in US have bizarre medical
conditions compared to developing countries. Some chalk it up to US
improved med tech diagnosis but the culprit could be elsewhere.
