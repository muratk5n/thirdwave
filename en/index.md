Paper: "Huge amounts of plastic products are produced, utilized, and
discarded each year, contributing to the increasingly serious
ecological problem. Photoreforming, a solar-driven technology,
provides an uncomplicated route to simultaneously recycle plastics and
facilitate hydrogen (H2) production. Herein, we proposed innovative
CdS/NiS composites which used visible light to drive H2 evolution from
plastic wastes"

Boehs: "The two richest companies, those two with their own search
indexes.. quietly downloaded all the text on the internet.. and fed it
into huge, glorified, energy consuming markov chains that we call
LLMs. Now, they encourage you to feed your questions to it, instead of
wading through all the shit they birthed. To users at this moment,
this proposition is immensely popular. Simultaneously, while users
jump ship from the web, website administrators continue to be lazy
with no regard for their best interests. They also view LLMs as game
changing. These products allow them to pump out more shit, much
faster. In this way, the vicious spiral begins.

I’m sure we all understand the most immediate problem hurtling at
us. AI is literally inbreeding as it continues to consume and
produce. Researchers have coined it 'Model Collapse', 'Model Autophagy
Disorder' and 'Habsburg AI'. It all means the same thing. The loss of
intelligence on the web is happening shockingly fast, and it’s only
accelerating. If you’ve been on Reddit or Twitter in the past few
months, the signs of bots chattering back and forth with each other
are unmistakable, while the platforms cheer it on and begin to sell it
back to the AI"

But it is a *great* moneymaker for the MIC.

James Warden: "NATO encourages free-riding on the part of our
partners; it encourages recklessness on the part of strategically
insignificant though wildly bellicose client states; it encourages
incredibly self-defeating behavior on the part of those nations that
want to join it; it encourages and helps enable the U.S. to meddle in
the Middle Eastern and North Africa where we have virtually no
business being"

Ars Technica: "Oregon Governor Tina Kotek today signed the state's
Right to Repair Act.. The law, like those passed in New York,
California, and Minnesota, will require many manufacturers to provide
the same parts, tools, and documentation to individuals and repair
shops that they provide to their own repair teams.. Oregon's bill goes
further, preventing companies from implementing schemes that require
parts to be verified through encrypted software checks before they
will function"

"@baldur@toot.cafe

Almost everything positive about LLMs you see today is based on
extremely unreliable evidence, much of it from some of the most
dishonest people you’ll find in tech (cryptocoiners, effective
altruists, etc.)

Given that these models are obscenely power-hungry during a global
climate crisis it’s my opinion that integrating these tools into your
daily work is inherently unethical and irresponsible"

Wiki: "A person with non-domiciled status, sometimes called a
'non-dom', is a person living in the United Kingdom who is considered
under British law to be domiciled (i.e. with their permanent home) in
another country. Non-doms pay UK tax to the UK government like all
other UK residents"

The Guardian: "‘Petrified’ non-doms poised to flee UK over Labour’s
tax plans, say experts Prospect of party closing Tory ‘loopholes’ if

Deaton, *Economics in America*: "[Milton] Friedman liked tax
competition between countries and supported tax havens, because they
put a brake on governments’ ability to tax. And he repeatedly argued
that attempts to limit inequality of outcomes would not only stifle
freedom but, in the end, result in even more inequality. Left to
themselves, free markets would produce both freedom and equality.

It doesn’t seem to have worked out that way.

Instead, we got a world in which the Sackler family paid themselves
more than $14 billion while igniting and promoting an opioid epidemic
that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans. Johnson & Johnson,
the makers of Band-Aid and Baby Powder, grew opium poppies in Tasmania
to fuel the opioid epidemic while the American military was bombing
the Taliban’s heroin supply in Helmand province. Private equity firms
discovered they could make money by buying up ambulance services and
staffing hospital emergency rooms with their own physicians who charge
'surprise' fees to patients even when their insurance includes the
hospital. Surprise fees in emergency rooms (and operating theaters)
were eliminated beginning in January 2022, but surprise bills for
ambulance services continue. If you need an ambulance, you are not in
the best position to find the best service or to bargain over prices;
instead, you are helpless and the perfect victim for a predator"
