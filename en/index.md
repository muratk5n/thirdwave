Andersen: "[B]y the 1980s, unions were reduced to desperate parochial
struggles to save jobs in declining heavy industries and, as mistrust
of government grew, to unionizing more government employees. Moreover,
the left offered no inspiring, politically plausible national economic
vision of a future. In response to economic Reaganism, the national
liberals were committed to preserving the social welfare status quo
for old people and the (deserving) poor, and to convincing America
that Democrats were now modern and pragmatic... Very few believed
anymore that unreasonable profits could even be a thing"

$g=\gamma$.

Excited to announce Skweejy, my new tech start-up that brings together
people with windows and people with ladders and buckets (who our
lawyers are emphatically clear are in no way Skweejy employees). It
most certainly isn't just a window cleaning business with an app. No
Ma'am"

Hedges: "The moral Universe has now been turned upside down. Those of
us who oppose genocide are accused of advocating it, those who carry
out genocide are said to have the right to defend themselves. Vetoing
ceasefires and providing 2,000 lb bombs to Israel that throw out out
metal fragments in densely packed refugee camps is the road to peace.
Refusing to negotiate to free the hostages, bombing hospitals,
schools, mosques, churches, ambulances and refugee camps obliterating
families are routine acts of war. Carrying out genocide in Gaza is a
way to de-radicalize Palestinians, attacking Houthi bases in Yemen is
deescalating a regional conflict. And remember it is not only Israel
which has abandoned its citizens held hostage in Gaza, there are
hundreds of Palestinians who are US citizens or permanent residents
trapped in Gaza and the Biden Administration is making no discernable
effort, as demanded by US law, to secure their safety"

Jeffrey Sachs: "US Foreign Policy Is a Scam Built on Corruption.

US foreign policy seems to be utterly irrational. The US gets into one
disastrous war after another -- Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya,
Ukraine, and Gaza. In recent days, the US stands globally isolated in
its support of Israel’s genocidal actions against the Palestinians,
voting against a UN General Assembly resolution for a Gaza ceasefire
backed by 153 countries with 89% of the world population, and opposed
by just the US and 9 small countries with less than 1% of the world
population.

In the past 20 years, every major US foreign policy objective has
failed.. American foreign policy is not at all about the interests of
the American people. It is about the interests of the Washington
insiders, as they chase campaign contributions and lucrative jobs for
themselves, staff, and family members. In short, US foreign policy has
been hacked by big money..

As a result, the American people are losing big. The failed wars since
2000 have cost them around $5 trillion in direct outlays, or around
40,000 per household. Another 2 trillion or so will be spent in the
coming decades on veterans’ care. Beyond the costs directly incurred
by Americans, we should also recognize the horrendously high costs
suffered abroad, in millions of lives lost and trillions of dollars of
destruction to property and nature in the war zones...

Yet to describe these gargantuan costs is also to explain the twisted
“rationality” of US foreign policy. The $1.5 trillion in military
outlays is the scam that keeps on giving—to the military-industrial
complex and the Washington insiders—even as it impoverishes and
endangers America and the world..

To understand the foreign-policy scam, think of today’s federal
government as a multi-division racket controlled by the highest
bidders...  Interestingly, the Health Industry division rivals the
Foreign Policy division as a remarkable financial scam. America’s
health outlays totaled an astounding $4.5 trillion in 2022, or roughly
36,000 per household, by far the highest health costs in the world,
while America ranked roughly 40th in the world among nations in life
expectancy. A failed health policy translates into very big bucks for
the health industry, just as a failed foreign policy translates into
mega-revenues of the military-industrial complex"
