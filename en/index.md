Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Reuters: "Saudi Arabia's NEOM Green Hydrogen Company (NGHC) has signed
financial documents with 23 local, regional and international banks
and investment firms on a green hydrogen production facility at a
total investment value of $8.4 billion.

NGHC, a joint venture between ACWA Power, Air Products and NEOM, will
produce 600 tonnes a day of carbon-free hydrogen by the end of 2026
using 4 GW of solar energy, the statement said"

Joint Letter on RU/UA: "We advocate for a meaningful and genuine
commitment to diplomacy, specifically an immediate ceasefire and
negotiations without any disqualifying or prohibitive
preconditions. Deliberate provocations delivered the Russia-Ukraine
War. In the same manner, deliberate diplomacy can end it" via

If neoliberalism did not turn out to be the shitshow it is today and
actually worked for people, and they wanted to put up a statue to
honor it, the monument would have those three guys, Pinochet, Reagan
and Rupert. I would use [this picture](mbl/0119/2016/murdoch.jpg) with
the newspaper headline engraved in stone for Rupert..

Pinochet's coup in Chile allowed the "Chicago boys" to practice their
mucky art unimpeded for a while in isolation. 'The revolution" was copied
to other countries later.

---

The three key events of neolib history, the Pinochet coup in Chile,
Reagan's firing of 11,000 striking air traffic controllers, and that
Murdoch thing with the print union workers. That is how Rupert got to
join the pantheon.

AP News: "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has struck new agreements with
his Australian counterpart Anthony Albanese on migration and green
hydrogen"
