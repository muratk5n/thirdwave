.. it's genuinely hilarious that literally all of the companies who
claim to need all your data so they can hyperpersonalize ads for you
that they say will then somehow work better than normal,
don't-need-to-know-the-name-of-your-firstborn-child ads are, very
obviously, utterly shit at actually personalizing anything based on
data"

Vertical Farm Daily: "Why the growth cycle of rice can be [cut] in
half.. Can rice grow normally in a closed environment without sunlight
and soil? The Institute of Urban Agriculture of the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences and a team led by Qian Qian, an academic from
the Chinese Academy of Sciences and deputy director of the China
National Rice Research Institute, found the answer.

After planting rice and growing it in a closed environment for 63
days, the rice produced full branches, which is more than half the
time it takes to grow rice in an open-field environment. "This is a
subversive breakthrough in the history of rice cultivation," Qian Qian
said"

Informed Comment: "Israel’s Strategic Weaponization of Water Against
Palestine is a War Crime.. The universal human right to water,
ensuring “sufficient safe, acceptable, physically accessible and
affordable water for personal and domestic uses” is a principle upheld
by international conventions. However, in the Occupied West Bank, this
right is systematically violated through Israel’s targeted assaults on
civilian water infrastructure"
