"Lithium, a key component of EV batteries, is extracted using heavy
diesel-powered machinery that emits substantial amounts of CO2. This
process undermines the environmental benefits promised by EVs. Studies
have shown that the CO2 emissions associated with lithium mining and
battery production often exceed the emissions saved by operating EVs,
especially in regions reliant on fossil-fuel-based electricity grids.

Furthermore, Earth’s lithium reserves are insufficient to supply a
global population of 8 billion people. As demand surges, mining
operations will expand into ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbating
environmental degradation and threatening biodiversity... EVs are
notably heavier than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE)
vehicles, primarily due to their large batteries. This additional
weight increases road friction, leading to accelerated wear and tear
on infrastructure. Local communities bear the brunt of these costs,
with road maintenance expenses tripling in areas with high EV
adoption.

Moreover, the increased road friction necessitates specialized tires
for EVs. These tires are approximately three times more expensive than
those used for traditional vehicles, adding another layer of cost for
consumers... The lifespan of a lithium-ion battery in an EV typically
ranges from 8 to 10 years. Replacing a battery can cost between 7,000
and 15,000 dollars, a significant financial burden for many vehicle
owners. This issue raises questions about the long-term affordability
and sustainability of lithium-powered EVs"

You obtain the college degree, and it is yours. It is non-perishable.
It looks like an asset. We notice another similarity to real estate,
tuition prices keeps increasing and the middle class increasingly has
to rely on loans to even "stay in the market". In that sense the
student loan concept mirrors a mortgage loan concept.

---

Should a college degree be seen as an asset? It is offered in limited
amounts to a few each year so maybe yes. Then this explains why
college tuition skyrocketed, just like real estate, degree-as-asset is
becoming more expensive bcz the rich gets richer pouring more money
into this asset class.

USAID could be doing other "good stuff". But why can't it all be good?

---

Well I dont know abt this man's other "disgressions", but USAID is a
somewhat shady org... The one share I made in them was [not good](2023/01/little-america-chandrasekaran.html).
They obstructed efforts for Afgans to switch to cotton from poppy.

This is the government continuity operation mentioned by DoD. So they

Reuters: "The three soldiers killed in the [black hawk] collision were
part of the 12th Aviation Battalion at Fort Belvoir in Virginia, whose
responsibilities in a national crisis include evacuating Pentagon
officials. Another 64 people were killed in the passenger plane...

[During 911 an official describes] going to a 'bizarre location that
was prepared to survive nuclear war'.. The book’s author, Garrett
Graff, said the site was called Raven Rock Mountain Complex, or 'Site
R', located just miles from Camp David. It remains one of three main
backup facilities for the US government, and the main one for the
Pentagon leadership. 'It’s 100 percent operational today. There’s a
team of maybe 100 personnel inside Raven Rock right now, ready to pick
up the pieces of the US government,' Graff said"

There are volunteer data contributors who walk around, mark stuff, OSM
collects such data, but that is mostly for big cities. And why do this
extra work..? Local municipalities already have that information. Just
put the file on a stupid static site, anyone can get them, done.  All
you need is a file server, not an app server.

---

The files would be small. Yet almost no city does this. 

---

Local govs (and federal ones) need to share public data, raw, easily
parsable formats. The simpler the better. For bus/train routes, all
you need to share is two files `stops.csv`, `routes.csv`. External
programs can download that, parse it, provide services on top. It is
simple coding to connect the route IDs that reference stops, listing
them as needed. Use case: stops data has geo coords, a DIY external
service gets data from muni, could find the closest stop to current
location, and calculates all routes going through that stop, displays
them.
