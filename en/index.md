David Deutsch: "AGI cannot possibly be defined purely
behaviourally.. the relevant attributes of an AGI program do not
consist only of the relationship between its inputs and
outputs.. unlike any functionality that has ever been programmed to
date this one can be achieved neither by a specification nor a test of
the outputs. What is needed is nothing less than a breakthrough in
philosophy, a new epistemological theory that explains how brains
create explanatory knowledge, and hence defines in principle without
ever running them as programs which algorithms possess that
functionality and which do not.  Such a theory is beyond present day
knowledge. What we do know about epistemology implies that any
approach not directed towards that philosophical breakthrough must be
futile"

AP: "Prisoners in the US are part of a hidden workforce linked to
hundreds of popular food brands..  A hidden path to America’s dinner
tables begins here, at an unlikely source – a former Southern slave
plantation that is now the country’s largest maximum-security prison"

Alfred Jazeera also has an irrational dislike for Assad, again Qatar
funded the civil war against him and had their ass handed to them,
along with their good friend "Turkey".

In general AJ has good coverage of Palestine.. I really don't care who
in charge there as long as it can lead to a sustainable peace.  PA is
fine bcz 1) Netan doesn't want it 2) Hamas did create certain amount
of chaos in area, a change could benefit the overall picture.

AJ is funded by Qatar who had direct relationship with Hamas (so did
Israel BTW). The channel might be covering for their paymaster so they
don't lose their influence in Gaza.

Alfred Jazeera.. did that mfka just bash the PA for no good reason
(see the rest of the article)?  Talking about 'crisis of legitimacy'..

Al Jazeera: "What is the Palestinian Authority..? Set up in the
mid-’90s as an interim body.."
