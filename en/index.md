Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

cloud was visible after one explosion.

Fueler: "BMW is presenting international media representatives with
the first vehicles in a pilot fleet of Hydrogen powered iX5s... You
fill your vehicle with Hydrogen at a fuel station like a petrol or
diesel vehicle. It is clean and straightforward and avoids any need
for charging, which is currently costing more and more... I believe
more manufacturers will look at Hydrogen as a source to power
vehicles, so looking at the BMW trial is exciting"

It still works for me but some complain Google search returns bad
results for them, results are not useful unless the string "reddit" is
appended to the search term. Reddit as we all know is extremely Web
1.0 but plain, clean, straight-forward human curated content.

Melenchon fell out of favor, Francois Ruffin is the rising star of the
French left?

Infighting in Sudan, two militaries are fighting; one is the official,
the other, RSF, is a paramilitary group started in 2000s. Much is said
about the RSF leader Hemeti but I heard one speech, he was saying "I'm
a simple Bedouin man who grew up on the sidelines of Sudan and did not
get anything from my country except violence". Life probably wasn't
too easy for him and his people... Generally though having two armies
neither of which feels too attached to civilian rule is not good. It's
like some next level IR joke..  building on the Paki version,
countries have a militaries, PK military has a country, in Sudan, two
militaries have the same country.
