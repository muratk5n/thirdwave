We need to stop seeing excessive wealth accumulation as something
'benign'. Even if money does not trickle down (and it won't), the
money will be used to buy assets which poses a big problem for regular
people.

Imagine giving an alien living in a completely different physical
environment all the text ever written by mankind, us. They decipher
the text, are able to read it. But would they, without seeing any of
the physical environment that gave rise to that text, understand what
it is to be human? They cannot. "I woke up saw the garden, walked in
the hills". If the aliens were non-solid, aethereal beings living in a
f-ing plasma mist, they could not get that reference. They'd put it
together, match it with other references of that kind, but they would
not truly know what it is meant on that text. Language is code. We
communicate *through* that code. Code signifies, is a shorthand for
something larger that is not present in that text, the
whole human experience.

Hah.. Jeremy Howard basically says of LLM tech "u ain't gettin
advanced AI w this shit". Development apparently stagnated already
even with the farcical parameters ppl judge these things meaning the
future does not look good. Improvements now resemble an S curve rather
than an exponential. If you sank money in this field you are
fukked.

Neocons, US militarism, Israeli Likud party, all there. All serving
the interests of the private war lobby..

Hossein-Zadeh: "[2006] Huntington’s theory of 'the clash of
civilizations' is essentially a subtle version of Richard Perle’s
strategy of 'de-contextualization.'  Perle, a leading neoconservative
militarist (and a prominent advisor of the Likud Party, the hard-line
Zionist party of Prime Minister Arial Sharon of Israel) coined the
term 'de-contextualization' as a way to explain both the desperate
acts of terrorism in general and the violent tactics of the
Palestinian resistance to occupation in particular. He argued that in
order to blunt the widespread global criticism of the Israeli
treatment of Palestinians, their resistance to occupation must be
decontextualized; that is, we must stop trying to understand the
territorial, geopolitical, and historical reasons that some groups
turn to terrorism. Instead, he suggested, the reasons for the violent
reactions of such groups must be sought in the arenas of culture
and/or religion—in the Islamic way of thinking. Like the 'clash of
civilizations' theory, decontextualization strategy has been part of a
well-orchestrated effort to divert attention from the root causes of
terrorism and attribute it to 'pathological problems of the Muslim
mind'"
