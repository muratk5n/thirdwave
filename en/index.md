CleanTechnica: "Red-Hot Green Hydrogen Field Just Got Hotter (and
Greener)...  Photoelectrochemical cells can push green hydrogen
directly from water without the need for standalone solar
panels... The Intertubes have been burning up with news of the first
billion-dollar unicorn to emerge from the boiling stew of green
hydrogen startups... Last week, a US startup called Electric Hydrogen
raised 380 million in a Series C round of funding on the basis of
building a better electrolyzer.  That raised the companyâ€™s valuation
over the $1 billion bar, earning it the title of the industryâ€™s first
unicorn"

NYT: "'[E]nmity toward Israel over its decades-long occupation of
their land' remained strong, particularly as Israel's government
expanded settlements in the Palestinian West Bank after the
agreements. On Saturday, when Palestinian gunmen from the blockaded
territory of Gaza surged into Israel, carrying out the boldest attack
in the country in decades, it set off an outpouring of support for the
Palestinians across the region. In some quarters, there were
celebrations even as hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians were
killed... Demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinians took
place across the region, including in Bahrain, Morocco, Turkey, Yemen,
Tunisia and Kuwait..

[I]n Egypt's coastal city of Alexandria, a policeman opened fire on
Israeli tourists, killing two Israelis and an Egyptian.The ripples
spreading from Gaza underscored what many officials, scholars and
citizens in the region have been saying for years: The Palestinian
cause is still a deeply felt rallying cry that shapes the contours of
the Middle East, and Israel's position in the region will remain
unstable as long as its conflict with the Palestinians continues"
