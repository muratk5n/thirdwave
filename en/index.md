The problem with the electric grid is that it is inferior technology,
a crude way of carrying energy from point A to point B. Molecules work
better than electrons. We could transmit energy 10 times faster at
eighth the cost using pipelines, if we use clean gas such as H2, the
whole transmission becomes clean, safe from interruption from extreme
weather events like the one mentioned below.

---

These storms only seem to damage power lines. No damage on pipeline
infrastructure? Not even one?

"During [AU Gold Coast storm] there were wind gusts upto 160 km/h,
200k lightning strikes recorded bringing down 500 power lines,
cutting electricity to 125k homes and businesses"

Every time you redesign your app, you vaporize all the experience
built up by everyone who's been using the current version. It better
be fucking worth it"

Boomers sadly raised the Gen Y who ran the risk of being as blind to
the world around them just as the boomers were.

It was probably easy selling anti-government sentiment to Americans.
After Watergate, Vietnam, the dozy headed bird brain boomers lost
their minds, pooh-poohed everything related to government and sold
their soul to the corporate world. And when things started to go wrong
later they still look for innuendo, mistakes "deep" within government
rather than the visible organizations that give them the sugar highs
that cloud their brains if not actively killing them with toxic
chemicals. Government can even serve as a potential controlling parental
scare figure taking the other side on the Woke debate, or censorship
debate, and of course any kind of parental presence you need to rebel
against. Avoid government, be afraid of government. Wait for Batman,
he will help you.

Okay so the director of *Die Hard*, *Die Hard 3*, *Predator*, *The
Hunt for Red October*, *The Thomas Crown Affair*, and, uh,
*Rollerball*, apparently has a new movie coming out next year after
directing nothing since 2003, and this is the description"

TASS: "Spain blocks EU participation in [anti Houthi] US operation in
Red Sea"

Read: Fuel that help bomb Gazans comes from a Muslim country.

Responsible Statecraft: "Presently, Azerbaijan supplies approximately
40% of Israel's oil demand, a critical lifeline powering cars and
airplanes"

---

It looks like Azeris have become Anglo's bitch, or more accurately of
the military-industrial-Likud complex. Some among them half-mouth some
Israel criticism, but trade continues.

"Israel’s support was instrumental in Azerbaijan’s victory in its
44-day war against Armenia in 2020."
