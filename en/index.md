Turchin, *Age of Discord*: "When [the Soviet Union] collapsed in 1991,
[govs] huge capital â€‹was rapidly privatized by corporate managersâ€”party
bosses, factory directors, and their cronies... Privatization was an
incredibly corrupt and violent process, with the winners literally
walking on the corpses of their less lucky competitors. In a darkly
amusing anecdote, at a meeting between the two most powerful Russian
oligarchs, Berezovsky and Gusinsky, one of them reportedly asked the
other: 'Why did you put a contract on me?' The response? 'No, it was
you who put a contract on me!' It turns out that each had hired
assassins to eliminate the other.

As most of the wealth became concentrated in the hands of fewer than a
dozen oligarchs, the well-being of the 99 percent collapsed. Russians
were dying in droves from deaths of despair. By 1996, popular
discontent became so intense that it was clear the incumbent
president, Boris Yeltsin, had no chance of winning reelection - his
approval ratings were in the single digits. The main challenger was
the communist Gennady Zyuganov. The oligarchate became concerned that
victory by the communists might create difficulties for their
continued looting of the country. A group of the most powerful
oligarchs, led by Berezovsky and Gusinsky, made a deal with Yeltsin:
in return for his guaranteeing the privatization of state enterprises,
they financed his campaign and threw their media resources behind
himâ€”by that point, they controlled all mass media. They also hired a
team of American political campaign consultants (including the
infamous Dick Morris [Clinton's advisor]) to manage Yeltsinâ€™s
reelection. Even that was not enough, and in the end they had to
resort to massive electoral fraud to reelect Yeltsin.

This is how Russia became an extreme plutocracy in 1996. Because the
oligarchs had little regard for managing the state, the disintegrative
processes gathered speed. The factory owners stopped paying their
workersâ€™ salaries, and there was a wave of labor strikes during the
autumn following the elections. A bloody war in Chechnya flared up
again. â€‹And in 1998, the country was hit by a severe financial crisis,
which resulted in the devaluation of the ruble and a default on the
state debt.

At this point, two main power networks formed in Russia. The ruling
faction was the economic elites (the oligarchs), who thoroughly
controlled the ideological elites by owning all major mass media. The
second group included the administrative elites (the bureaucracy) and
the military elites (the so-called *siloviki*, who included state
security and military officers). In the ensuing power struggle, the
alliance of administrative/military elites, led by Vladimir Putin,
defeated the plutocrats. There was no sudden revolution; rather, the
process was gradual, as one oligarch after another was exiled
(Berezovsky and Gusinsky), imprisoned and then exiled (Khodorkovsky),
or relegated to a subordinate position in the power hierarchy
(Potanin)"

Renewables Now: "[Study conducted] Uniper Energy Storage has indicated
strong interest in hydrogen storage in North West Germany even in the
initial phase of hydrogen ramp-up starting in 2029 and beyond.. Uniper
noted that according to a recent study by the association Gas
Infrastructure Europe, achieving the REPowerEU targets will require
hydrogen storage capacity of around 45 TWh in Europe by 2030 and
around 300 TWh by 2050, well above the planned projects of 9 TWh by
2030 and 21.5 TWh by 2050"

Clarkson is the former host of *Top Gear* the famous car enthusiast
show, he surely understands cars. Battery-electric just doesn't make
sense from any angle, usability metric, TCO. It's just a bad
solution. Kicked off to spoon-feed a Democratic president his legacy,
it limped on for a while due to US being a tech trendsetter, but it
finally crashed into the wall called *reality* and is about the meet
its inescapable end.

Jeremy Clarkson: "It took me about 15 minutes to work out that electric
cars were rubbish. But when I said so, on television, I was called a
climate change denier, luddite and fool. So you can imagine how happy
I was yesterday to discover that millions of people are now coming
round to my way of thinking.

In Germany, electric car sales fell in March by a whopping 29 per
cent. And across the rest of the EU by 11 per cent. In the UK.. the
share of the market taken by battery-powered cars is down from
16.6â€Šper cent last year to 15.2 per cent in 2024. Things are so bleak
that Tesla is laying off 14,000 people globally. Thatâ€™s ten per cent
of its workforce.

Some say this is all because governments are reducing the tax breaks
given. But itâ€™s mostly because people are waking up to the fact
electric cars are expensive, boring to drive, useless for long
journeys and, if we are honest, not especially good for the
environment"
