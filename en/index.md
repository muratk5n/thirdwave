Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

cell powered motorcycle.. The MIT EVT hopes that the hydrogen fuel
cell motorcycle development will help to overcome a range of
challenges associated with BEVs while addressing concerns regarding

H2 View: "US multinational Honeywell announced its new Liquid Organic
Hydrogen Carrier (LOHC) solution to enable the long-distance
transportation of clean hydrogen. The Global Hydrogen Flows report
predicted that of the 660 million tonnes of hydrogen needed to meet
global Net Zero by 2050, 400 million are expected to be transported
over long-distances, with 190 million tonnes set to cross
international borders"

Culture does not care about how it is labeled.. it will be transmited
via osmosis, people-to-people, one-on-one through the land and its
people no matter what. Cannot change your culture by labeling it
differently, or by wearing funky hats, telling stories or following
rituals. The duty of an intelligentia is to pinpoint this fact, argue
around the true source of culture, lest be responsible for generating
neurotic behavior in their students.

Herodotus was eating yoghurt in 800 BC; he didn't need some punk from
Asia riding in on a donkey to teach him about it (who hadn't even
arrived by then, that would be a thousand years later).

Turks arriving into Anatolia were assimilated; 1920s TR
nationalization, "Turkification" merely performed a labeling
trick. The founders wanted to create historical amnesia so they picked
an exotic, irrelevant ethnicity (somewhat innocuous to them meaning
simply Muslim as most founders were from the Balkans), and everyone in
Anatolia were rebranded. Muslims were transitioned, history was
rewritten so that all culture before "the arrival" was made to look
like was brought by these irrelevant group, not pre-existing before
their arrival. This is how Byzantian music became 'Turkish Music",
Greek/Balkan/Arab food became "Turkish food", and Yemenese coffee
became "Turkish coffee".

Therein lies the fallacy of the "we need more younger workers to
support older population" argument.. Would more "young people" going
into soft drink industry generate value, real benefits, in the long
run? The problem is money creation is toow tied to businesses (as
credit), it needs to be tied in large part to salaries (which can
later become credit).

---

Money, credit generated for this business segment is for useless
production. Zero benefit for the humankind.

Statista: "Revenue in the Soft Drinks segment amounts to US$0.85tn in 2023"
