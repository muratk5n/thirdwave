MLK: “The evils of capitalism are as real as the evils of militarism
and racism. The problems of racial injustice and economic injustice
cannot be solved without a radical redistribution of political and
economic power."

Kurt Andersen: "Back in the 1930s and ’40s, there had been very
left-wing Democrats with serious national prominence and significant
political bases. Franklin Roosevelt’s own vice president Henry Wallace
was one, as most notably was Senator Huey Long of Louisiana, who
introduced bills in the 1930s to enact a 100 percent income tax on
earnings over the equivalent of $20 million and a wealth tax of 100
percent on everything over 1 billion dollars. Which made the president
seem moderate when his 1935 'Soak the Rich Act' raised the tax on
income over 2 million to 55 percent. 'Political equality,' FDR said in
1936, is 'meaningless in the face of economic inequality.' In what he
pitched as a Second Bill of Rights, he proposed guaranteeing all
Americans 'the right to earn enough' for 'a decent living' and 'a
decent home' and to have 'adequate medical care' paid for with 'a tax
[on] all unreasonable profits, both individual and corporate.' That
was 1944, Peak Leftism for Democrats on economics"

Gary Stevenson: "The tax system as it is is not really designed to tax
people whose income comes from wealth.. there is huge amount of wealth
in this country, not just housing but also commercial wealth, land,
shopping centers, office buildings, factories.. these are owned by
richer people, they generate enourmous amount of income from [it].
With the way the tax system is designed it is possible for rich people
to generate huge amounts of income from wealth, and to legally avoid a
lot of tax. They [certainly] don't have to pay income tax on most of
wealth based income. The end result is these people in many cases pay
rates as low as 10% or sometimes even lower, on the income from their
wealth.

What we actually have is a tax system that is progressive for ordinary
people, the rate is higher the more you earn, and once you get into
the realm of.. wealthy people, the rate starts to collapse.

I think it's it's quite interesting that.. the tax system is kind of
moving back towards.. Medieval Times where essentially working people
pay tax to the aristocracy.. Increasingly a big chunk of the tax that
you pay literally goes towards paying government debt interest to the
rich. You pay your tax - a lot of that goes to the rich then you pay
your rent - that goes to the rich you pay your mortgage - that goes to
rich you go to buy food and that goes to the landowners, you buy
energy and that goes to the energy owners..  [this] looks increasing
like a very extractive system..

The lack of taxation of the rich creates a big problem with flows of
wealth. Recently I've been really trying to lobby politicians, 
unsuccessfully, to start taxing wealth, tax working people less on
their income and tax wealth more.. I've been trying to push them to
tax people who have a wealth of over £10 million; 1% of their wealth,
and they don't [even] want to do that. But wealthy people will make
three, four, five percent income on their wealth anyway, so.. even if
you were to tax them one percent they would still generate an enormous
excess income that they could then use to compete with your kids to
buy property...

I should probably just talk briefly about VAT & NI.  [UK] National
Insurance is a form of income tax that only applies to working people,
only applies to work..  National Insurance [is] specifically targeted
at working people, then you have VAT which is on consumption, now very
rich people consume very very small percentage of their income so they
pay very little VAT.. VAT is targeted at ordinary people, National
Insurance targeted at working people. Income Tax [is] avoidable for
the rich, Inheritance Tax [is] avoidable for the rich.. The end result
is you have a tax system which looks progressive for ordinary people
because you're only comparing yourself to people around you who are
ordinary people at the same time you have this small group of people
who are phenomenally rich who are increasingly buying everything you
don't often get to see in day-to-day life that they are paying
nothing, generating huge amounts of income and using that income to
buy the rest of the assets. Who pays tax? If you're a working person
in an ordinary financial situation - YOU! Who doesn't pay tax? Very
wealthy families, the people who receive your mortgage payments your
rent payments, the money you spend on food and bills. They don't pay
any tax on that and they are then using that money to buy the rest of
the wealth, so it creates this really bad structural problem..

If we don't take any action against that, it is inevitable that in 20
years, 30 years, ordinary families will not have any assets left
basically. It will be very difficult to own property and if you do own
property you'll be forced to have an enormous mortgage"
