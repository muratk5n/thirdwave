Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Politico: "[Matthew Desmond] makes a refreshing, brutally honest case
that poverty is pervasive in America by design, to enable the
lifestyles of affluent people. U.S. rates of poverty are substantially
higher and more extreme than those found in 25 other developed OECD
countries, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Poland,
Portugal and the United Kingdom.

[His] greatest contribution is changing the lens from individual
behavior — the hoary focus of so many books about poverty — to asking
and answering the larger question, “Who benefits from practices that
keep people poor?” Poverty, he argues, results from three
quintessentially American habits: exploitation of the poor;
subsidization of the rich; and the intentional segregation of the
affluent and the poor such that opportunity is hoarded and social
mobility is rare"

Others in the Gulf were involved in Syria conflict too, but Qatar took
to the effort with passion, became wedded to it as a win there would
prove that they had "arrived". It was not meant to be... It was a
major loss of face for them.

Arabia.. The leaders of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt publicly
praised Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s participation in the summit
after Syria was readmitted to the Arab League"

The real world is not a constrained, finite-space Go board. It is
messy. That's why neural net based cars still [cannot drive](https://futurism.com/experts-alarmed-tesla-fsd).

AlphaGo Zero was sadly another example of weak AI parroting; AG0
generated its own data, played against itself and learned from that,
meaning it compressed it and "made art" from it, a dataset of over 4
million datapoints. Its programmers did make some legit algorithmic
design improvements in a certain tree search approach (human coded,
not deepfaked by an parrot moron algo), but the rest is... simple
compression. Sample games are compressed into a neural net, for
subsequent games computer can make similar moves "inspired" by that
training data.. That's pretty much it.
