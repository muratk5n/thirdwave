Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

"Thanks to the fleet of the first world-class and top-ranked EuroHPC
supercomputers, European scientists and industry are increasingly
processing their data inside the EU. Such a trend is not only
advancing science and boosting the innovation potential of companies
and SMEs in Europe, but is also reinforcing the protection of the
privacy, data protection, commercial trade secrets and ownership of
data in Europe"

Ivo Labbe: "‘We just discovered the impossible’: how giant baby
galaxies are shaking up our understanding of the early Universe.. I
run the analysis software.. and it spits out two numbers: distance
13.1 billion light years, mass 100 billion stars, and I nearly spit
out my coffee. We just discovered the impossible. Impossibly early,
impossibly massive galaxies.

At this distance, the light took 13 billion years to reach us, so we
are seeing the galaxies at a time when the universe was only 700
million years old, barely 5% of its current age of 13.8 billion
years. If this is true, this galaxy has formed as many stars as our
present-day Milky Way. In record time.

And where there is one, there are more. One day later I had found six"

Newsfile: "First Hydrogen.. confirms its hydrogen-fuel-cell powered
light commercial vehicles (LCV) are performing even better than
predicted. In the first phase of commissioning, the Company's LCVs
accumulated 6,000 km on UK roads, including mileage around London's
M25 motorway. The data logging supports vehicle range simulations,
which exceed a 500 km range. The vehicle is currently performing with
excellent efficiency, including both urban, extra-urban (which
includes driving at higher speeds) and highway operations. First
Hydrogen's LCV fuel consumption figures seen in many driving scenarios
are under 2 kg / 100 km, and in mostly urban driving this is 1.5 kg /
100 km"

Blackwater, Wagner are somewhat different, they are private, have
members from all walks of life as with the French Foreign Legion but
in a war Wagner fits in to the hierarchy somewhere. RSF has been that
alternative "second military" for a long time now, actively toppling,
helping form new governments. They are used to having access to power.

---

Former Sudan prez Bashir created the second group RSF as a Praetorian
Guard, who later turned on him. RSF grew in size and capability over
the years now rivaling the real military SAF itself.

Easier said than done especially when there are two militaries instead
of one to deal with.

For anyone who wants to read an accurate account of how open-source,
as in **free** software, made inroads into the industry, should check
Chris Anderson's excellent book *Free*. CA details Microsoft's
experience with open source through psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler's
famous Five Stages of Grief. In the end, Stage 5 - Acceptance: Gates
and Ballmer took their best shot and had their ass handed to
them. Open source could not be quashed, and it has been growing ever
since.

The Times of India: "Green hydrogen: India is betting big on making a
transition towards renewable energy and reducing dependence on fossil
fuels, and one key factor in this is green hydrogen. According to
the National Green Hydrogen Mission, by 2030 India hopes to
develop green hydrogen production capacity of at least 5 MMT per
annum"
