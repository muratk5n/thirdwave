Clean Technica: "More Bad News For Fossil Fuels: Green Hydrogen Is
Making Green Steel Happen.. Steelmaking was once thought to be
difficult if not impossible to decarbonize, with a key step in the
process fully dependent on coal or natural gas. Well, that was
then. The world’s first and biggest full scale green steel plant is
taking shape in Sweden, with an assist from green hydrogen. That
leaves about 1,000 steel plants around the world yet to decarbonize,
but at least it’s a start"

They filmed the movie in a single, unbroken shot, hence the
name. There are some theatrical aspects to that but the camera angle
still matters (in theatre you don't control that), it looked like the
production meant to show scenes in a specific way, so it had to hit
those points in a continuous shot, that is tough to prepare for.

*One More Shot*, sequel to *One Shot* - interesting concept.

Corporate wing of the CA Democrats are so scared of any type of Wealth
Tax talk they don't know know where to hide whenever the issue comes
up. This is from the "left" of the US politics. Massive budget holes,
massive wealth accumulation, it is clear where the fix is, yet Dems
argue among themselves how much social services they can cut and
whether they can, pretty-please, maybe give the lower income folk a
tax cut once in a while.

Without water you can't build a "vibrant" city, dumbass

The Urbanist: "Now billionaire and former Walmart executive Mark Lore
has dreamt up plans for building another utopian city in the desert,
Telosa..  Some of the greatest expenses in Telosa will be related to
the city’s environmental challenges. Building on cheap land in the
desert comes with disadvantages, most notably lack of water – which
incidentally is already a major challenge for U.S. cities like Los
Angeles, Miami, Phoenix, and Atlanta. Critics have noted that the
climate crisis will only worsen water shortages"

Governator Ahnuld of course did not fix that problem, he inherited it,
then kicked the can down the road.. Fixing that hole would mean
taxing people like himself.

$68 BILLION budget gap? See how wealth tax comes up when the issue is
big budget gaps. It is the only way.

The Sacramento Bee: "California Democrat pushes wealth tax as $68
billion deficit looms... A California Democrat is renewing his efforts
to tax wealthy residents’ net worth as a potential solution to closing
the state’s 68 billion spending gap... Assembly Bill 259 would
institute a 1% tax on the net worth of residents with more than 50
million dollars in assets, with a 1.5% bracket for those with more
than 1 billion"

From an "Opium Wars payback / 'correction' POV blockade also makes
sense - CH gets a redo through a Third Opium War, in the first two
they failed to defend homeland, but they will defend China this time,
a China including of course Taiwan. They extend the borders to contain
the island and wait for the foreigners to arrive. Fucka me, fucka you.
