Good question.. FDR did a lot of things, but it is clear he found an
opening, a willingness on the part of the wealthy to exploit, and he
pushed his agenda that way. He could not do everything on his own, by
simply ordering it to be so.

This is the famous Princeton study by Gilens et al

Paper: "[2014, Our] analysis indicates that economic elites and
organized groups representing business interests have substantial
independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens
and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent
influence. The results provide substantial support for theories of
Economic-Elite Domination and for theories of Biased Pluralism, but
not for theories of Majoritarian Electoral Democracy or Majoritarian
Pluralism"
