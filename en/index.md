Reuters: "The European Commission has signed off on about 3 billion
euros ($3.2 billion) of planned German state aid for building a system
of hydrogen pipelines known as the Hydrogen Core Network (HCN). Berlin
plans to give financial guarantees to allow companies that build and
run the 20 billion euro network to obtain more favourable loans to
cover initial losses during the ramp-up phase from 2025. Encouraging
the uptake of hydrogen outweighs any distortion to EU competition and
trade from the scheme, the Commission said on Friday"

The American Conservative: "A Vision for a New NATO.. Expansion was a
misstep, but the situation is not unsalvageable—history offers clues
to a better way...

On an unusually cloudy July day in London in 1990, the heads of state
and government at the annual NATO summit declared with sunny optimism
that a new era beckoned in central and eastern Europe. The declaration
itself was banal bureaucratese: invitations to initiate diplomatic
contacts, plans to prepare a force structure that would move away from
'forward defense' towards 'flexible response.'.. 

Secretary of State James Baker had personally assured Gorbachev in
February that NATO would move 'not one inch' eastward. This pledge was
repeated in some form or other by NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Wörner, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Margaret Thatcher,
Francois Mitterrand, and President George H. W. Bush. British Prime
Minister John Major, when asked by Soviet Marshal Dmitri Yazov about
East European leaders’ interest in NATO membership, reassured him that
'nothing of the sort will happen.'..

[A] careful study of Russian reactions to various phases of NATO
enlargement gives the impression of a rational power originally
determined to be a friend if not an ally of the West... The surprise
in Moscow was therefore palpable when the NATO enlargement study was
launched in 1995, leading Boris Yeltsin to declare that the Cold War
was slowly being replaced with a 'Cold Peace.' The pro-Western
democrats in Russia naturally felt betrayed, rightly recognizing NATO
expansion as a threat to their domestic influence"

Stoller: "Josh Hawley and Matt Gaetz.. saw big business as an
existential threat, arguing that large firms were simply too powerful
to co-exist with an elected government, as Trump had said in 2016
about media conglomerates. Others, like House Judiciary Chair Jim
Jordan and House GOP leader Steve Scalise, retreated to what they
knew, which was to treat big business as part of the Republican
political machine, but needing a little wayward discipline"

Quora: "[W]hen the [French] PM is from an opposite group (this
situation is called cohabitation) his/her powers become clearer. This
happens when the majority in the national assembly changes during
presidential office, the President has to choose a PM from the new
majority (not legally but strategically, and this has happened 3 times
since the beginning of the 5th Republic in 1958). There the PM has
democratic legitimacy because the change in majority means that the
citizens are unsatisfied with the President's party's policy, so it
becomes politically dangerous for the President to oppose the PM's
actions, especially the choice of the ministers, and refusing to sign
the decrees implementing new laws (it happens though).  As you can
guess cohabitation periods are complicated, with many tensions and
more or less difficulties to govern considering the actors' ability to
find compromises and to cooperate with each other"

It was a good call, both for him and FR; otherwise prez had to govern
under a suspicion of legitimacy there'd a bizarre lull. By calling for
snap elections u throw down the gauntlet to the electorate, "you
voted for the oppo for EU, do you want them to govern the country as
well?"  Now people will either back centrists out of the usual fear of
far-right, or the opposition gets a mandate and finally have a seat in
governance. Either way the lull is resolved.

F24: "[Macron] stunned the nation by calling the polls for June 30 and
July 7 after the far-right National Rally (RN) trounced his centrist
alliance in EU elections earlier this month... But the president hit
back on Tuesday, saying dissolving the National Assembly was 'the
heaviest, the most serious, but the most responsible solution' after
the EU election debacle"

Biden net approval hovers around -17%, he still has the advantage
taking other parameters into account (incumbency, a non-crashing
economy). But let's not count out Trump. An "Alpha Team" usually does
not run during unfavorable times, for '24-like races it's been beta
types that run, historically, think Hillary '16, or Mitt '12.
