The Guardian: "Bollards and 'superblocks': how Europeâ€™s cities are
turning on the car..  A fightback is now well under way, driven by a
pressing need to cut air pollution and combat the climate crisis, and
a wish to reclaim cities as pleasant places to live. Most major
European cities now have schemes in place to reduce road traffic"

The Guardian: "[2009] Drug money saved banks in global crisis [GFC],
claims UN advisor.. Drugs and crime chief says $352bn in criminal
proceeds was effectively laundered by financial institutions.. Antonio
Maria Costa, head of the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, said he has
seen evidence that the proceeds of organised crime were 'the only
liquid investment capital' available to some banks on the brink of
collapse last year. He said that a majority of.. drugs profits was
absorbed into the economic system as a result"

"The Hyperloop was always a scam.. A decade on, people often forget
what was really motivating the Hyperloop.. In the early 2010s, there
was a big debate around Californiaâ€™s plan to build a high-speed rail
line from Los Angeles to San Francisco... Naturally, conservative,
automotive, and airline interests were vehemently opposed to a
technology that Japan and Europe had been living with for decades
arriving on American shores because it threatened their commercial
interests"

Stiff upper lip rich class wanted to avoid EU "limitations" (such as
the ECJ), immigration was never an issue for them. They needed and
still do need cheap workers to service their needs, fetch them coffee,
work in stores and put a stupid hat on during "Christmas sale". A
cheap servant class was required and they are getting them.

NYT: "'Take Back Control' of U.K. Borders. What Happened? Record
numbers of legal immigrants came to Britain from outside the E.U. in
recent years. Some on the right call that a 'Brexit betrayal'.

Far from closing its borders, Britain has thrown them open since
voting in 2016 to leave the European Union. And as the coronavirus
pandemic has subsided, legal immigration has exploded. Net legal
migration â€” the number of people who arrived, minus those who left â€”
reached nearly 750,000 people in 2022"

Humanity cannot conflict resolve, cannot even address genocide
happening under its own nose. Thinking that this species can peek into
the creation of the universe and theorize, reason about things
happening at that instance is ludicrous. Naturally most theories in
this domain are poppycock. The universe expansion is debunked and so
is the Big Bang.

We need better than human performance out of AI, we'll have to rely on
these things for automation, for patient care... A mechanical arm at a
factory is better than a human arm, and it is better, consistently. The
arm never goes "well I dont feel like lifting that mechanical part
today, 20% of the time I just won't do it". ðŸ¤¨

Apparently Gary Stevenson was an interest rate trader at Citibank.
Seriously that's what the guy did, his job, was trying to predict
interest rates one year ahead. But think about what that entails;
growth, debt, deficit, basically knowing how the economy is going to
be in one year because all that ties into rates. If econ is good, CB
will raise, if bad, will lower. Not an easy job.

"The recent ["AI"] transfer of [the movie] *True Lies* shows that some
people need their deep learning algorithms taken away from them... The
transfer.. has a truly vile quality to it, a feeling like someone
clandestinely dosed you with LSD just a hair below the threshold. At
times it can look passable in motion, but then you notice something
out of the corner of your eye: a thick fold of skin, a framed photo of
a child, folders that are too thick at the margins, cheeks that look
rendered. Itâ€™s that familiar dread at the pit of your gut when you
spot AI generated imagery, a combination of edges not looking quite
right and surfaces that are simultaneously too smooth and too sharp. A
crime was committed here, and you can tell"

Richard Murphy: "How did we reach the point where our society has
failed so badly that malnutrition is now a first world
problem?.. industries like big pharma and big sugar-based food
production have been allowed to prosper. Superficially satisfying
short-term sugar spikes have replaced vitamins and essential minerals
in too many affordable diets...

So, how to solve this? The answer is straightforward. The requirement
is regulation to demand better food whilst cutting sugar from
diets. It could be done. But the resulting foods are not addictive,
when sugar is. The result is there is less profit in them, because
nothing is more addictive than hooking people on products destructive
to their wellbeing... [but our] current health secretary is,
staggeringly, married to the Chair of British Sugar"

Annual changes in the housing stock (percentage), on average, looks
higher than population change. There are enough housing units, but top
10% is likely hoarding them, some people cannot find places to
live. We can regulate home ownership - mandate so that noone can own
more than one home, or a patch of land bigger than enough to live on,
for individuals or business alike, including farming. The rest becomes
public property.

```python
df = u.get_fred(1970,["TTLHHM156N","POPTOTUSA647NWDB"])
df = df.interpolate()
df.columns = ['housing','population']

df.pct_change().mean()*100
```

So not an innocuous little massage

Webb, *One Nation Under Blackmail*: "[I]n the early 1990s, Epsteinâ€™s
name was mysteriously dropped from a major investigation into one of
the largest Ponzi schemes in history even though he was labeled the
mastermind of that swindle in grand jury testimony. Around the same
time, subsequently released White House visitor logs show that Epstein
visited the Clinton White House 17 times, accompanied on most of these
visits by a different, attractive young woman. Reporting on those
visitor logs was largely done by a single media outlet, Britainâ€™s The
Daily Mail, with hardly any American mainstream media outlets
bothering to investigate these revelations about Epstein and a former
US president.. Why was Epstein so heavily protected from justice for
decades â€“ in connection to both his sex trafficking crimes and his
financial crimes?.. If powerful Senators knew what Epstein was doing
to young women and girls â€“ who else knew and why wasnâ€™t something
done?"

The Intercept: "Dozens of prominent investors and business leaders
traveled to Israel this week to show solidarity with Israel.. The trip
included top officials from private equity firms like Bain Capital;
leaders from the tech industry, like a Patreon executive..  'In every
war there are multiple fronts. The attendees of this mission are here
to help counter the warâ€™s economic disruption.'  The documents, which
include an itinerary provide details about the weeklong meeting taking
place in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, called the Israel Tech
Mission. Beginning on Sunday, the meeting includes panels like 'Tech
in the Trenches: Supporting an ecosystem during wartime'"

"@JoshuaHolland@mastodon.social

When the Spanish Civil War broke out, Hitler and Mussolini went all-in
backing Francoâ€™s Nationalists but the big democratic powers, England
and France, offered the democratically elected Republicans tepid
support because they were wary of socialists and trade unionists being
part of the coalition. Their half-hearted defense of democracy
emboldened the fascists and contributed to the outbreak of WWII"
