Only Microsoft can build basic file syncing software that consumes two
full CPU cores while doing nothing, and uses 1.19 GB of disk
space. One of the worldâ€™s richest corporations is responsible for this
heap of shit"

Bitcoin being an energy hog is one of its many disadvantages. The most
important one is its limited money base - money base needs to expand,
otherwise you will get deflation. Some think this feature makes
bitcoin "politics free" bcz politicians "print and debase money" but
no money is politics free. Gold became currency because the king made
it so. It has no intrinsic moneyness attribute. Bitcoin is libertard
cosplay, that's all it is. AND a waste of energy.

Bitcoin's energy consumption doesn't make it a grift, con, or
scam. Bitcoin is an incredibly transparent system with regard to how
it operates"

Public sphere is overrun by private interests

The Atlantic: "America Has a Private-Beach Problem.. Accessing the
least-crowded section of New Yorkâ€™s Lido Beach requires either money
or insider knowledge. Anyone staying at one of the hotels on the beach
can walk through the lobby, and those living in the adjoining town can
waltz in through a separate gate using a residents-only electronic
access code. Everyone else, though, has to come in through a public
entrance half a mile away and walk over the sand. In theory, some
portion of every beach in the coastal United States is reserved for
collective useâ€”even those that border private property. But exactly
how big that portion is varies widely, and in practice, much of the
shore is impenetrable"

NYT: "Pope Says a Strong U.S. Faction Offers a Backward, Narrow View
of the Church..  In unusually sharp remarks published this week, Pope
Francis said some conservative American Catholics wrongly ignore much
of the Churchâ€™s mission and reject the possibility of change...

Pope Francis has expressed in unusually sharp terms his dismay at 'a
very strong, organized, reactionary attitude' opposing him within the
U.S. Roman Catholic Church, one that fixates on social issues like
abortion and sexuality to the exclusion of caring for the poor and the
environment"

Watching Greenland burn and Libya flood and France turn to desert,
some in the last few years and some in the last few days, reinforces
the lesson: there is no precedent for the climate catastrophe in any
meaningful human memory. The last time the global average temperature
was as different as weâ€™re about to face was 12,000 years ago, before
the state and before the city and before writing.

Thereâ€™s nowhere that will be predictably stable or safe. Thereâ€™s no
preparation that can address the flux. I am unmoored and bereft in a
way I canâ€™t articulate"

I love my smart TV. I love the way it takes a long time to boot up
because it's trying to refresh the advertisements on the home
screen. I delight in the way it randomly restarts because it's
downloaded an update without asking me, each of which makes the TV
slower and slower with every subsequent install. I adore the way it
buries the apps that I want to use, and that I use without fail every
single time, below the apps that it's being paid to promote and which
I have never touched in my life and would never use without the cold
metal of a glock pressed hard against my sweating temple. I am
infinitely thrilled by the way the interface lags constantly, due to
the need to have one thousand unnecessary animations rendered on
hardware ripped wholesale from a ten year old phone. I feel myself
borne aloft on wings of pure joy when I am notified that my data will
be collected and analysed to determine my useage patterns. Even now I
am writing this from a field of beautiful flowers and soft luscious
grass as I lie and look up happily at the bright blue sky, smiling
happily to know that this is the future of technology"
