Dgtl Infra: "Data centers primarily get their water from municipal or
regional water utility companies. This water is essential for the data
center's cooling and humidification systems. For cooling, data centers
mainly use potable water, which is suitable for drinking, provided by
these utilities"

There is no challenge.. you simply do not switch to inferior
technology - battery-electric tech.

Nebraska Today: "Designed as an inexpensive, high-performing barrier,
the.. MGS, was developed.. in response to barrier ruptures and
rollovers with older systems. The MGS has been tested with small cars
that weigh up to 2,400 pounds and pickups that weigh 5,000
pounds... EVs..  typically weigh 20% to 50% more than gas-powered
vehicles, with lower centers of gravity.. Todayâ€™s challenge is to
again adapt roadside barriers to match the mix of heavier electric
vehicle"

That makes sense.. The same software looked at the situation concluded
the same thing. This could be a problem in the future if self-driving
car deployment increases. 

"Waymo.. issued a recall for its own self-driving car software after
two of its vehicles hit the same truck minutes apart"

Blood in the Machine: "We donâ€™t yet know exactly why a group of people
very publicly graffitied, smashed, and torched a Waymo car in San
Francisco. But we know enough to understand that this is an explosive
milestone in the growing, if scattershot, revolt against big tech.. We
know that self-driving cars are wildly divisive, especially in cities
where theyâ€™ve begun to share the streets with emergency responders,
pedestrians and cyclists. Public confidence in the technology has
actually been declining as theyâ€™ve rolled out, owing as much to
general anxiety over driverless cars as to high-profile incidents like
a GM Cruise robotaxi trapping, dragging, and critically injuring a
pedestrian last fall. Just over a third of Americans say theyâ€™d ride
in one"

Hey if you aid and abet state terrorism against Gazan children it's
