The inflation of faux ethnic "heritage" or PC identities help alienate
the common man from the rest; they want your being chopped up into
tiniest little pieces so it will be impossible for you to identify
with a fellow citizen, and especially with the plight of the common
man or woman. The further away the system makes one from the masses,
in mentality, in general feeling, the better off they are.  Fellow
citizen is one paycheck away from bankruptcy but shitlib looks at him
and thinks 'does he identify as non-binary, genderqueer, metrosexual?
Is he Estonian / Scottish, Scottish / Italian, she/him/they, Polish /
Eskimo / Whateverfuck? All these labels create artificial obstacles
for relating.. which likely is the aim.

Formulation, theory requires more than "functions". In materials
science a steel beam under stress has the displacement formula $E I
\frac{d^4 y}{d X_1^4} = q$ , a fourth order dif eq, that ain't a
function. When solved w given cond result is one, and a different one
for each condition; all from the same base formula. AI has a long way
to go.

There has been some clumsy attempts to create "theoretical basis of
AI" I remember one proof that equated learning with compression - if
one cld compress certain data one can learn that data. But, the way
they defined learning (they called "PAC learning") was such that
naturally compression would be the obvious answer, which isn't that
interesting at all. You assume inputs, outputs and a "function" in
between, what the flack else could be the outcome? A smaller
representation in terms of a function, which is, compression.

"[Workers at a] construction company noticed something odd about their
Xerox photocopier: when they made a copy of the floor plan of a house,
the copy differed from the original in a subtle but significant
way... a modern Xerox photocopier.. scans the document digitally, and
then prints the resulting image file. Combine that with the fact that
virtually every digital image file is compressed to save space, and a
solution to the mystery begins to suggest itself...  Lossy compression
is often used for photos, audio, and video in situations in which
absolute accuracy isn’t essential...

Think of ChatGPT as a blurry jpeg of all the text on the Web. It
retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way that a
jpeg retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image,
but, if you’re looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won’t find
it; all you will ever get is an approximation"
