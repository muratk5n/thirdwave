Attempting to coexist with an existing fiat system invites undue
problems for both sides; new money's selling point will be freer,
easier exchange and that invites crime, money laundering. Over years
old fiat added all sorts of safeguards, which the Wild West of the new
threatens to run roughshod over burning big and small users, something
old fiat gov cannot ignore (ppl vote). When mildly integrated into the
old, the new is a speculation plaything, pushing it away from its
original mission. Lose-lose all around.

Money is inextricably tied to politics / governance. There is no
"politics free money". Unlike what some naive libertarians seem to
think even gold was tied to a system - [kings made it possible](0119/2011/11/debt-religions-money.html), 
without them there would be no gold currency. Therefore, hard to change
currency (ie to crypto) without changing governance, at a
fundamental level.

2011 was a good time to do it, they gave that success to the black
President whose orders to assasinate (an Arab) would be more palatable
in terms of P.R.

The left hand, and the right hand..  One does not know the other. But
sometimes, the right hand can leave bread crums for left hand to find,
to force action on a certain problem.. Through friends in Pakistani
ISI US deep state knew where Bin Laden was kept. It's all about
information. Once you know that location, you sit on it, and you own
his ass. Then, at the right time, the "invisible hand" will release
the info where it can be "discovered" by the other hand because it is
obvious what they will do with that information, attempt to kill Bin
Laden, which they did. As most know by now BL was killed at a
residence half a mile away from a Pak military training academy.

.. A typical EV contains more toxic electronic components than a
couple of desktop computers. A typical small EV is run by over 1000lb
of toxic and carcinogenic lithium battery which is very expensive to
recycle and hence will never be 100% recycled"

GreenBiz: "[T]he lithium-ion batteries used in BEVs are expected to
cause a serious environmental crisis when they reach the end of their
useful lives..  Several studies, including one by Argonne National
Laboratory, have demonstrated that creating and using hydrogen for
fuel cell vehicles is more environmentally friendly than using grid
electricity to power battery EVs"
