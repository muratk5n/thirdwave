This random comment has given me my new favourite argument for
removing fares from public transit.

'The reason most public transportation is seen as ‘losing’ money is
precisely because it charges for trips. If you don't charge fares,
suddenly it can't ‘lose’ money. It just costs money, the same as the
roads.'"

Nature: "Over the past generation, scientific publishing has become a
monoculture. Every scientist now seeks to publish their work in a
peer-reviewed journal and journals seek to increase their impact
factors. Publishing papers is now synonymous with seeking status.

Monocultures are vulnerable to viruses and prone to collapse, and that
is exactly what is happening to science. Taxpayers fund our work but
journals paywall it and reap the revenue. The costs of universal
prepublication peer review are extraordinary but the benefits are
dubious: reviewers miss most of the errors in papers and fail to catch
even the most brazen fraud. Many of the findings that pass peer review
do not replicate and most of them may in fact be false. The artificial
scarcity of opportunities to publish causes publication bias, which
distorts our sense of what is true and what is not. Unsurprisingly,
scientific progress seems to have stalled.

In our hearts, all of us know how we would pursue truth if we did not
have to pursue status as well. The only question is: are we brave
enough to do it?"

Your reminder that I've written a book on the business risks of
generative AI. 'The Intelligence Illusion'

[https://illusion.baldurbjarnason.com/](https://illusion.baldurbjarnason.com/)

Stuff I cover (not exhaustive):

- AGI is not happening any time soon.
- AGI and anthropomorphism will cripple your ability to think clearly about AI
- The AI industry has a long history of snake oil and fraud
- These models copy more than you think
- Hallucinations are still a thing and aren't going away.
- AI 'reasoning' is quite broken
- Security is a shit show"

NPR: "More than 804,000 federal student loan borrowers are in for a

efforts at widespread debt forgiveness, these borrowers are about to

that their debts will soon be automatically erased"

European Commision: "[12/22] The Digital Markets Act (DMA) establishes
a set of narrowly defined objective criteria for qualifying a large
online platform as a so-called 'gatekeeper'.. Example of the 'don'ts'
- Gatekeeper platforms may no longer.. treat services and products
offered by the gatekeeper itself more favourably.. prevent consumers
from linking up to businesses outside their platforms.. What will be
the consequences of non-compliance? Fines..  of up to 10% of the
company’s total worldwide annual turnover, or up to 20% in the event
of repeated infringements"

Who's going to tell Mel Gibson?

"[2000, WaPo, There was an] ancient Catholic teaching that 'the Jews
killed Christ.' Since time immemorial, that accusation has been hauled
out as an excuse for discrimination, pogrom and Holocaust... In the
gospel story of Good Friday, Pontius Pilate is portrayed as a weak,
frightened leader. Poor powerless Pilate wants to set Jesus
free... It's a dramatic story. Biblical scholars say it probably
served a political purpose for the early Christians by steering blame
away from the Romans. But everything we know about the Roman
government of Judaea and about Pontius Pilate himself tells us that
this scenario is probably bunk"

His party became a plaything of ultra free-market fucknuts from US they
sent their [best guy](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jun/15/uk.otherparties)
to do black magic, and they managed to pry UK away from the EU weakening
both (the long-term goal of such strategico is  weakening *everyone* in
Eurasia, not just Russia). Morris is one Ace c-ksucker. The fact he helped
Bill Clinton should tell you all you need to know about him.
