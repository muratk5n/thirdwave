In a milestone, the \#US exceeds 5 million #solar installations.. The
5 million milestone comes just eight years after the U.S. achieved its
first million in 2016 -- a stark contrast to the four decades it took
to reach that initial milestone... Since the beginning of 2020, more
than half of all U.S. solar installations have come online, and over
25% have been activated since \#InflationReductionAct became law 20
months ago"

*Atlas* - not bad.. I'd rate it higher than, say, *Kill Command*. It
references some recent idiotic sci takes, real-life characters in the
beginning, but moves on to tell its independent story. I recommend
it. 

---

*Fall Guy* entertaining, though some scenes linger little too long.
Generally ok.

I dont think anyone is talking about Furiosa, period. The movie
bombed.

For things that need to run faster, can always paralelize the task ie
run it concurrently. Concurrency is still underutilized in many
applications.

I'm really really really not interested in computers getting more
powerful... I am super interested in them being more repairable and
modifiable, drawing less power, lasting and being supported for way
longer etc"

First order of business outlaw tax havens. Second order of business,
outlaw all SEZ.

It's no joke, inside those places private firms rule, the host country
turns a blind eye to employer offenses, there are no unions, companies
set the rules. I'm convinced they could shoot a man at will, cover it
up, and the legal framework would allow it \#SEZ

Kennard, *Silent Coup*: "[W]e next wanted to look into the secession
of territory globally to private investors... we found a lawyer.. who
had described how [Special Economic Zones] SEZs vary widely in their
details, but that they often involve 'excluding or modifying the
application of parts of the national law in defined geographic areas'

These weren’t just carve-outs of physical territory, therefore – they
were also exceptional spaces where normal rules didn’t necessarily
apply. These zones also seemed to often offer the – sometimes explicit
– promise of a steady supply of cheap and compliant labour for
investors’ factories. The reality of promised jobs included numerous
reports of worker’s rights abuses in ‘sweatshops’.

The ILO said ‘trade unions point to these zones as being islands,
outside the scope of traditional industrial relations ... that are a
symptom of the race to the bottom in the global economy.’ A worldwide
patchwork of these spaces seemed to mean that, once one workforce
began to mobilize and demand better wages or conditions, companies
could leave and move on to another.

The World Bank, we found, had produced many reports studying and
promoting SEZs.  Along with investing in private businesses, its IFC
branch and other bank teams gave developing country governments
‘advice’ on how to make themselves more attractive to private
investors, including what laws they should change. Such zones seemed
to be a regular item on the menu.. [A] researcher at Utrecht
University, had studied SEZs for years. They are commonly 'regulated
differently than a nation’s 'normal' territory, to the extent that
they may have their own police forces with considerable sovereignty',
he said"

The National Interest: "TOS-1A: Russia's Thermobaric Artillery Is One
Horrific Nightmare Weapon.. When deployed, thermobaric ordnance is a
devastating weapon as it employs oxygen from the surrounding air to
generate a high-temperature explosion. Also known as aerosol or vacuum
bombs, these can create a  massive shockwave followed by a fire cloud
where the temperature can reach 2500-3000 degrees Celsius (4500-5450
Fahrenheit). In addition to certainly killing anyone within the blast
radius, the heat from the weapon can cause significant damage to
structures and vehicles –igniting any fuels and lubricants, as well as
setting off any ordnance. Many targets are essentially vaporized"
