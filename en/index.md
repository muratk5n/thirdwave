Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

New Scientist: "It takes just four particles of light to jump-start
photosynthesis in a plant's cells, but the details of what exactly
happens after the fourth photon is absorbed have eluded researchers -
until now.. Two teams of researchers have revealed microscopic details
of how oxygen is formed during photosynthesis, the process by which
plants, algae and some bacteria harness sunlight to create the energy
they need to grow. Understanding photosynthesis at this level could
advance the development of clean fuels"
