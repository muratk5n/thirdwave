Apple are again behaving in a dodgy manner with Apple Intelligence.

Again full screen prompted to enable it on latest security update on
iPhone.. the only other option is “Set up later”, and they disabled
screenshots of the prompt.

This is the kind of shit Microsoft pull to try to make Bing
happen. It’s really disappointing"

I've been paying Google for 100GB storage for quite a while. Just got
notification of this year's pending charge and cancelled the sub. Now
purging the large collection of frivolity I have amassed on their hard
drives, downloading most folders as zips just in case but it's mostly
just junk like mp3s I wanted to share or whatever.

Divest from Silicon Valley now!"

Lei: "Despite record-breaking financing in Hong Kong and the
announcement of ultra-fast charging technology, China’s leading EV
maker is likely to follow the same trajectory as [China's Evergrand],
due to its 'high debt, high turnover, and high leverage' growth
model. In China, BYD faces mounting quality concerns. [Here] are [the]
hidden risks threatening its future:

1. Lack of technological innovation
2. Hidden debt
3. A fragile supply chain"

Battery-electric tech suffers from diminishing returns. Faster
charging brings in more complexity and degrades the battery
faster. You can't beat physics. Electric tech can never beat the speed
of energy transfer via physical molecules.

Allowing massive concentration of wealth is like allowing people to
yell out "fire" in a crowded theather... These are both examples of
self-reinforcing feedback loops. Panic can build on itself and spread
like wildfire dwarfing everything else, same thing can happen with
massive wealth concentration, it will build on itself, grow and grow,
eventually taking all assets from the middle class and even from the
government itself. At the end, every one except the top will end up
poor.

"Hard Truths" he says... the title of his book. It reads like the

MW, in his book, calls US not responding "properly" to Russia as "[a]
feckless response to Russia’s taking of Crimea" in 2009. Should US
have gone to war with Russia over Crimea? I don't think this guy gets
it. Your oligarchs were running Ukraine, ultra-nationalist you
sponsored were provoking Russians in the East... And you complain
about Crimea?

Antiwar.com: "The US launched dozens more airstrikes on Yemen on
Sunday as the Houthis claimed more attacks on US warships and fired
another missile at Israel... The Houthis, officially known as Ansar
Allah, have shown no sign of backing down in the face of the US
bombing campaign, which began on March 15. Houthi military spokesman
Yahya Saree reaffirmed Sunday that Yemeni military operations will
continue until 'the aggression against Gaza stops and the siege is
lifted'"
