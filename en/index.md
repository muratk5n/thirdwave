H2 Central: "[Motor Vehicle Manufacture Poppe + Potthoff GmbH] has
designed an alternative specifically for pipes and rails in hydrogen
applications... PPH2 is an alloyed carbon steel with high mechanical
properties, which are further enhanced by the innovative PPSH
annealing treatment. These special properties allow the production of
thinner-walled components (compared to stainless steel) and thus a
reduction in weight while increasing the availability of hydrogen
pipes and rails"

CBS News: "'California's price gouging penalty is simple – either Big
Oil reins in the profits and prices, or they'll pay a penalty,' said
Newsom said in a press release. 'Big Oil has been lying and gouging
Californians to line their own pockets long enough. I look forward to
the work ahead with our partners in the Legislature to get this done.'
California lawmakers kicked off a special legislative session on
Monday to consider the proposed penalty"

That is a nice little word play there with the title, it can be
read as either "ISIS is U.S." or "ISIS is us".

From the book *ISIS is US*: "Did the 'Islamic State' spring full-blown
into spontaneous being as the fanatical scourge of the Middle East, or
was it helped along by state sponsors?

The parallels with Iran-Contra are uncanny. In the 1980’s, the Reagan
administration wanted to topple the government of Nicaragua, using
right-wing mercenaries, death squads, based in Honduras.  But Congress
passed a law prohibiting that. So they went around it, by financing
the Contras via Iran.  Thirty years later, the hawks in Washington
wanted to topple the elected governments of Libya and Syria, crush the
popular resistance in Iraq, and split up those countries on ethnic
lines. Once again, they wanted to do this using death squads. So they
got around Congress by having Qatar and the Saudis finance it.

To set up the Sunni and Shiite death squads to fight each other in
Iraq, they sent John Negroponte as Ambassador to Baghdad in 2004. The
same guy they sent to Honduras as Ambassador from 1981 to 1985. Then
in 2011 they sent some of those killers from Iraq to Libya to
overthrow Qaddafi, with NATO air cover. From Libya, they were sent to
Syria to start the killing there – the dirty war directed by
Negroponte’s right-hand man, US Ambassador Ford.  The US embedded
media perversely pinned these killings on Assad, following the script
for another NATO invasion. Only Russia’s UN veto spared Syria"
