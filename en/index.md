NPR: "[2013] There's a saying in Mexico: *Sin maiz, no hay pais*: no
corn, no country. Mexico is where corn originated, and it's the food
staple most people depend on. It's what Antonio Pena grew on his
family farm in Guanajuato in Central Mexico...

The Mexican government used to subsidize corn. It kept the crop price
high so small farmers could stay in business. And it kept tortilla
prices low so poor people could eat. When NAFTA took effect two
decades ago, the trade agreement phased out tariffs in order to lower
costs and encourage investment between the U.S., Canada and
Mexico. The Mexican government ended its corn subsidy..

Seventy-five thousand Iowa farmers grew twice as much corn as three
million Mexican farmers at half the cost. U.S. corn flooded Mexico. An
estimated two million Mexican farm workers in general left the
countryside for big cities. Antonio Pena was one of them... Then, like
millions more Mexicans, he crossed illegally into the U.S."

Caldwell maybe had motivation to leak, but more likely war hawks used
the opportunity to get the scalp of a war skeptic.

Reuters: "One of U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's leading
advisers, Dan Caldwell, was escorted from the Pentagon on Tuesday
after being identified during an investigation into leaks at the
Department of Defense, a U.S. official told Reuters.

Caldwell had drawn attention in Washington for past views that critics
have called isolationist, but which advocates said sought to
right-size America's defense priorities.

A Marine Corps veteran who deployed to Iraq, Caldwell was quoted
saying before going to the Pentagon that America would have been
better off if U.S. troops had just stayed home... 'I think the Iraq
war was a monstrous crime,' Caldwell told the Financial Times in
December 2024."

.. [Y]ears ago Norwegians started to get pre-filled tax returns in the
mail. Later they stopped getting them, but instead had to do [it]
online. Now even that is not needed... The reality is that the
government already had most of the data needed for most
individuals. Your salary is reported by the company you work for. Your
bank details, including anything you have in your accounts, any loans,
stocks, bonds, etc., is reported as well. Your kids are known.. There
might be details to add, but most is known. Why waste people´s time
filling out details that are already known and risk people making
mistakes?"

"Simplifying the tax code"... Another mantra that never seems to
materialize... I bet bihness interests *want* the tax code Byzantine,
the law is full of loopholes, kickbacks, indirect handouts that
way.. And at the end you can claim "government inefficiency" and
create a cottage industry around it... Bihness wins twice.
