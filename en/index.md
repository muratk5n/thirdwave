Stephen Gruyère is being let go? I don't think Gruyère is fired for
being not funny, he has been not funny for a while now and they still
kept him. But he platformed Mamdani, that could've triggered his

The Lever: "So much for preventing government waste. After months of
warnings from federal workers were ignored, 500 metric tons worth of
emergency, high-nutrition biscuits intended for global disaster relief
are instead marked for incineration, The Atlantic reports. Thanks to
the Department of Government Efficiency, which all but eliminated the
U.S. Agency for International Development, routine foreign aid
expenses — including deliveries — now require approval from the very
top. Yet employees’ requests to distribute the biscuits were ignored,
and now they're nearing expiration, leading the Trump administration
to order their incineration."

The Lever: "Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces across the country
are projected to see the largest rate hikes in more than five years,
driving up out-of-pocket premiums for individual plan policyholders by
more than 75 percent on average, according to data compiled by the
Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 21 million Americans who don’t
have employer-sponsored health insurance rely on the ACA marketplace
for coverage."

DJT net approval reaching the previous record low. The Epstein saga is
surely partly to blame. The subject was incredibly clumsily handled.
