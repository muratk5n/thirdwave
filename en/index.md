Wiki: "Revisionist Zionism is a form of Zionism which is characterized
by territorial maximalism. Revisionist Zionism promoted expansionism
and the establishment of a Jewish majority on both sides of the Jordan
River. Developed by Ze'ev Jabotinsky.. [it] insisted upon the Jewish
right to sovereignty over the whole of Eretz Yisrael, which they
equated to Mandatory Palestine and Transjordan..

Revisionist Zionism has strongly influenced modern right-wing Israeli
parties, principally Herut and its successor Likud"
