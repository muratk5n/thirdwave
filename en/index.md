In a historic first for Europe, green hydrogen producer Lhyfe has
signed a memorandum of understanding with major stainless steel
company Ugitech to create a green hydrogen production facility at
Ugitech's plant in the French Alps.

This pioneering partnership aims to replace dirty pollution with clean
hydrogen in steel manufacturing, according to Renewable Energy
Magazine.

Under the agreement, Lhyfe will install a green hydrogen production
unit capable of generating around 13 tons per day at Ugitech's site in
Ugine, France. The locally produced hydrogen will power the steel
plant's furnaces and heating equipment, with excess supply made
available to fuel clean transportation in the region.

Game HTML gets embedded inside an `<iframe>`, our articles are in

compile doc as usual, voila, game runs within site's look and feel.

Silicon Valley, Big Tech creates fluff, bullshit products, vapourware
all the time. But the big daddy of them all is still the MIC. They've
been at this for over half a century. They are good at it.

The private, revolving-door military-industrial-donor-complex has it
wired so good, sometimes they don't even have to deliver a functioning
product to make money.. A promise, a mere dream of a product will
do. See the example of XM2001 Crusader mobile cannon, project greenlit
in 1995 (Clinton admin), canceled after $7 billion, they delivered
nothing. Zilch. The military leaders pushing such systems are
promoted, not punished, and likely moved on to cushy private sector
jobs. The corporate press saw none of this as they were heavily
focused on more pressing issues such as "gays in the military".
