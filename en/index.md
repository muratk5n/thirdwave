Hydrogen-Powered Air Taxi.. In a significant milestone for sustainable
aviation, a hydrogen-powered air cab has completed an 842-kilometer
flight.. Joby is one of several companies at the forefront of creating
air cab services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL)
vehicles. Initially, the company focused on developing all-electric
aircraft with a range of approximately 160 kilometers, intended for
urban and intercity transport. Joby recently adapted a prototype of
its electric aircraft to operate on hydrogen. Equipped with a liquid
hydrogen tank and a fuel system, the modified VTOL successfully
completed a flight of 842 kilometers over Marina, California, using
only 90% of its hydrogen fuel load.

Nutella said, back in 2015, "Microsoft's new computerized goggles,
HoloLens are the new desktop". You can find this reference on Business
Insider.

It's not just him, Bill Gates wrote a book with the title THE ROAD
AHEAD (1995) and it completely missed the Internet boom that would
follow in a few years. Let alone the road ahead, the book could not
see in front of its nose.

Gates did a little better after his CEO stint, maybe there's something
blinding about being a tech CEO. You are too mired in the market, your
market share, sales, every thought has to be shaped in service to
that, and they miss the general trend. They are easily gripped by
FOMO, blinded by hype.

Tadella Nutella said in 2021 "cannot overstate what a breakthrough
metaverse is" (via Zitron w/ Connover).

That's not exactly a yardstick to judge any tech by, neither this CEO
or previous ones were really good about predicting tech future.

"If [so-called] AI was not a big deal why is Microsoft CEO so excited about it?"
