*Evil Geniuses*: "[In the 2000s] the world’s second-richest man and
most beloved American billionaire—beloved because he’s both low-key
and plainspoken—admitted that those labor leaders in the late 1970s
had been right, that the privileged and powerful had launched a
one-sided war against working people and the middle class. 'There’s
class warfare, all right,' Warren Buffett said, and 'it’s my class,
the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning'—and we
'shouldn’t be.'  Forbes had published its very first list of the
richest people in 1982, estimating Buffett’s wealth then to be the
equivalent today of almost $700 million. Two decades later, when he
talked about the rich waging and winning class war, his fortune had
grown to 58 billion. His fortune is now 85 billion, 130 times what it
was at the beginning of America’s—his phrase—class war"

I cannot see why hybrids have "lower emissions", if you are using ICE
to charge the battery, then you are still emitting GHG while charging
the battery. The savings obtained from regenerative breaking is about
15%, not a game changer. Hybrids, just like battery-electric vehicles
are a waste of time and money. We can have full ZEV that uses an
efficient fuel that can be cleanly used, produced and stored.

"Hybrid electric vehicles are powered by an internal combustion engine
and one or more electric motors, which uses energy stored in
batteries. A hybrid electric vehicle cannot be plugged in to charge
the battery. Instead, the battery is charged through regenerative
braking and by the internal combustion engine"

When Western sources label Russia as "isolated" they make obvious the
self-centric nature of their worldview, just like when West Asia is
labeled "the Middle East". The middle of *what*, cracker? You mean the
middle to the east of you? Well that only flies when everything is
situated according to you.

Hossein-Zadeh: "A widely shared.. view, especially outside of the
United States, attributes the recent rise of U.S. militarism,
especially the invasion of Iraq, to the geopolitical imperatives of
Israel and the concomitant influence of the Zionist lobby. Some of the
proponents of this view go so far as to argue that the U.S. foreign
and/or military policies in the Middle East are made by leading forces
or figures of militant Zionism.. Without denying the contributory
roles of these factors, [my work] points to a more crucial force
behind the drive to war and militarism: the powerful beneficiaries of
military expansion and war dividends, or the military-industrial
complex and related influential interests that are vested in the
business of war and military expansion"
