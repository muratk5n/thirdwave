Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

The best things in life are free

Data Scientist: "My custom [code] uses high resolution radar data
collected in 2000 by the Space Shuttle Endeavor. For about 18GB of
hard drive space, the SRTM GL3 dataset covers nearly 120M square
kilometers of Earth’s landmass in 90m increments... It is interesting
to note that Google currently charges $5 per 1000 requests to their
Elevation API, but thanks to NASA and a few lines of code, we can get
the same high-quality results, free of charge"

Teenage kid made a sailboat voyage around the world, the logistics:
had Internet, sat phone, a ton of food tinned, 500+ chocolates, 200+
Easy Food vacuum cooked ready meals, lamb chops - as in full-blown
meals. Then save for the occasional physical labor required to direct
the ship it's mostly being rocked and it's mostly enjoying the view
and sometimes being bored. It's like a teenager room on the move, wout
the parents. And later she goes on to become a bleeping management
consultant, and her former sail buddy boyfriend dies on her? Sad.
