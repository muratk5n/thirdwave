Politico: "In Supreme Court battle over transgender rights,
conservatives look to an unlikely ally: Europe.. 'Systematic reviews
by national health authorities in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Finland,
and Norway have all concluded that the harms associated with these
interventions are significant, and the long-term benefits are
unproven,' Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in
defense of the state’s ban on transition-related medical care for
minors"

Everywhere I look:

Media, politicians, and police: 'This sort of criminal behaviour is a
signifier of the deep rot at the heart of the civility of our politics
and it must be cracked down on with law and order.'

Normal folks: 'Oh, so it's a crime to kill him but not for him to kill
my aunt? Eat my entire ass'"

Increased enterpreneurship doesn't spur growth. Entrepreneurship is 10
times more in US than in the EU, but growth in US is slightly more
compared to Europe. Why? US is the center of finance, risk capital,
and one of the most business-friendly places in the world. Why not 10
times the performance?

The more you dig into the details, the more you will be gobsmacked
about how "limited" the earlier sci generation truly was. You will see
their blunders (and there were many) surely along with their
successes. There is no need to look at the era in grandiose terms and
solidify, freeze, wrap their findings as-is in a cloud of mystery,
wonderous mystic unknown only to be awed at and never be probed or
understood. We cannot build more stupid conclusions on top of this
mess.

Barandes: "Remarkably, the right-hand side of [the formula above]
gives the general mathematical formula for quantum interference,
despite the absence of manifestly quantum-theoretic assumptions. One
sees from this analysis that interference is a direct consequence of
stochastic dynamics not generally being divisible. More precisely,
interference is nothing more than a generic discrepancy between actual
indivisible stochastic dynamics and hypothetically divisible
stochastic dynamics.  In particular, quantum-mechanical interference
does not imply that matter has a physically wavelike nature, contrary
to frequent claims in textbook treatments like [The Feynman Lecture on
Physics] . Indeed, from the perspective of the present discussion, the
notion that quantum-mechanical interference ever necessitated
assigning matter a physically wavelike quality was merely an
unfortunate accident of history, arising from the fact that many early
empirical examples of interference in quantum systems happened to
resemble the behavior of interfering waves propagating in
three-dimensional physical space"

The Anglo biz-terrorists only care about corp profits, sometimes that
is access, their franchising, finance can enter a country, if not,
chaos works too, in that case their weapons will. See Syria, Libya,
Ukraine, Iraq as examples.

When the CEO of the United Fruit company wanted to arrange a coup in
Honduras the Department of State told the him **not** to do it. DOS
even put a tail on him, he evaded the tail, hired bunch of ships,
mercenaries and went to Honduras and overthrew the government there,
installed a puppet president in 1912. This was a businessman.

Now biz owns government through their donor networks, corruption,
kickbacks and revolving doors, the little amt of guardrails that
existed have been completely eradicated in the good part of the last
century, and this one.

---

US business culture is a merchantilist, a biz-terrorist culture, the
Anglo hails from plutocracy, not an ordered militocracy, as in France,
Russia, elsewhere (almost everywhere else). The Anglo exercises rabid
expansionism, not in a way an empire does but more like in a
franchising mentality, its expands its operations, virus-like,
"diversifies" them to use a term from portfolio management. It will
avoid killing if it can enslave (for cheap labor), or sometimes be
content to cut the thumbs off of the weavers in India to destroy a
competing local industry. Let's remember the East India *Company*
performed that feat not the government itself.

H2 Central: "KfW is supporting the construction of a national hydrogen
core network on behalf of the German Federal Government. This
forward-looking project is a key component of the Federal Government’s
national hydrogen strategy, as a result of which infrastructure with a
total length of 9,040 km is to be created by 2032. By financing a new
instrument – the amortisation account – KfW will be making a
significant contribution to the implementation of this technology of
the future. KfW is providing a loan for the amortisation account in
the amount of EUR 24 billion. The loan agreement was signed yesterday
evening"

"[The oil depletion allowance] was first introduced in 1913 and
allowed producers to use the depletion allowed to deduct just 5 per
cent of their income and the deduction was limited to the original
cost of their property. However, in 1926 the depletion allowance was
increased to 27.5 per cent. As Robert Bryce pointed out in his
book.. 'Numerous studies showed that the oilmen were getting a tax
break that was unprecedented in American business. While other
businessmen had to pay taxes on their income regardless of what they
sold, the oilmen got special treatment'"

That Texas oilmen had JFK killed apparently was an open secret in
Texas business circles during the 60s.. 

---

Another likely culprit for JFK assasination is Texas oil
interests. Yes, the beloved businessman, again.

Before the assasination JFK wanted to cut the "oil depletion
allowance", a major moneymaker for oil companies. His VP LBJ was a
former oilman, he apparently orchestrated the assasination in
conjunction with Texans to stop the move, had JFK killed (note, while
in Texas). The allowance remained untouched during LBJ's term who was
sworn in after Kennedy.

See there is no need for the "deep state" explanation. It was the
*surface state*, top-level politicians in the pay or in cahoots with
moneyed interests, who truly run America.

Tariffs, keeping the dollar as reserve currency are diametrically
opposed. The rest of the world needs dollars to function, US brings
those dollars to them via its trade deficits, at the cost of turning
US into a basket case, a non-country country. If US acts like a
country normalizes its trade balance, the world could naturally want
the dollar dominance to end. I hope it ends. A bancor system would
work much better. It would not require deficits, in fact the system is
designed to balance trade.

Since he played the *Red* Hulk in the new Cap Am and the movie is
blatantly anti-Trump I wondered if Harrison Ford is a Dem shitlib,
Team Blue, (social) left.  And of course he was.. "I was raised

told a news source recently. He must have enthusiastically signed up

Feinman, *Delay, Deny, Defend*: "Almost everyone who has health
insurance has a story about an arbitrary or incomprehensible denial of
a claim. [NY DOL found that] the databases used by insurance companies
to calculate the 'reasonable and customary' fees they would pay for
out-of-network treatment were part of a scheme to defraud consumers by
systematically lowballing the fees. UnitedHealth, Aetna, Guardian, and
other companies agreed to stop using the faulty databases and
contribute to the creation of a new independent database...

Insurance companies have influence with regulators for all of the
usual reasons and some unusual ones. The usual ones include money. For
nine of the ten most recent federal election cycles, the insurance
industry has been among the top ten in campaign contributions... in
the 2008 presidential campaign, for example.. Democrat Barack Obama
received $2.2 million...

Industry influence is magnified by the unusual structure of insurance
regulation. An industry dominated by huge national and sometimes
multinational corporations is regulated in fifty state capitals..The
multistate regulatory structure gives companies opportunities to
whipsaw state regulators, threatening to support optional federal
chartering of insurance companies or threatening to stop writing
insurance in a state, as seems to happen regularly when regulators
express any reluctance to allow companies to raise rates as they
please"
