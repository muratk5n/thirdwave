Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Hersh: "[A]s some in the American intelligence community know and have
reported in secret, at the instigation of government officials at
various levels in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech
Republic, and Latvia. These countries are all allies of Ukraine and
declared enemies of Vladimir Putin.. [Poland] has been quietly urging
Zelensky to find a way to end the warâ€”even by resigning himself, if
necessaryâ€”and to allow the process of rebuilding his nation to get
under way. Zelensky is not budging, according to intercepts and other
data known inside the Central Intelligence Agency, but he is beginning
to lose the private support of his neighbors"

Regulation, fine. But we need to realize it is because the stuff isn't
smart, quite the opposite, it is too freaking dumb \#AI

Cleantech: "Last November Governor Reeves proudly announced that
Indiana-based Steel Dynamics is pumping $2.5 billion into an expansion
of its existing campus in Mississippi...

Hy Stor first proposed a green hydrogen hub for Mississippi back in
2021. Under the name Mississippi Clean Hydrogen Hub (MCHH), the
project leverages Hy Storâ€™s underground salt formations forÂ storing
hydrogen gas in bulk, produced only from renewable resources. Hydrogen
functions as an energy carrier, so the bulk storage angle would
effectively provide steel makers and other industrial users with
reliable, 24/7 access to renewable energy...

Despite all anti-ESG posturing, Governor Reeves enthusiastically
endorsed the project in a hearty letter of support addressed to US
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in October of 2021"

A sign I'm getting old -- all my favorite albums have remastered
versions. How did this happen?"

Part of ESG is "dumb green" projects eg electrification, batteries,
battery-electric cars. Clean fuels should not be bundled together with
them. H2, NH3 approach can scale, is open to both old and new
participants in the industry.

Oz Independent MP Chaney: "We need to have a broader conversation
about housing affordability, everyone wants the value of their home to
stay high, they also want their kids to be able to afford a house one
day. There is a fundamental disconnect here. We have to be able to
talk about things like negative gearing, capital gains tax, as well as
supply-side issues rather than continuing just responding with more
popular demand side injections of additional funds that just drive the
prices furhter up" \#ABC
