Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Lowe: "Why AlphaFold [NN in biology] won’t revolutionise drug
discovery.. DeepMind’s AlphaFold team has been having quite a run of
success in predicting protein structures. This has long been
considered one of the truly difficult problems in computational
biology..

[But] some of the headlines have betrayed real misunderstandings about
what’s been accomplished. First off, as I wrote here earlier this
year, we have not made sudden huge leaps in understanding why proteins
fold like they do. The AlphaFold people have made great progress in
recognising different known protein folding motifs and assembling them
into structures that are very often correct. Forming these coils,
loops, and sheets is what proteins generally do, but ‘why?’ doesn’t
enter into it...

It also needs to be emphasised that (as carefully worded above) what
we have are predictions and not real protein structures. They’re good
predictions and useful ones, but obtaining actual data (from x-ray,
NMR, or cryo-electron microscopy) is the only way to be sure how
correct they are.. That’s why press coverage about how this new
prediction database will revolutionise drug discovery are overblown"

Lerner: "To everyone who sees them, the new James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) images of the cosmos are beautifully awe-inspiring. But to most
professional astronomers and cosmologists, they are also extremely
surprising—not at all what was predicted by theory. In the flood of
technical astronomical papers published online since July 12, the
authors report again and again that the images show surprisingly many
galaxies, galaxies that are surprisingly smooth, surprisingly small
and surprisingly old.  Lots of surprises, and not necessarily pleasant
ones. [One paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09428)’s title begins
with the candid exclamation: “Panic!”

Why do the JWST’s images inspire panic among cosmologists? And what
theory’s predictions are they contradicting? The papers don’t actually
say. The truth that these papers don’t report is that the hypothesis
that the JWST’s images are blatantly and repeatedly contradicting is
the Big Bang Hypothesis"
