Annual changes in the housing stock (percentage), on average, looks
higher than population change. There are enough housing units, but top
10% is likely hoarding them, some people cannot find places to
live. We can regulate home ownership - mandate so that noone can own
more than one home, or a patch of land bigger than enough to live on,
for individuals or business alike, including farming. The rest becomes
public property.

```python
df = u.get_fred(1980,["TTLHHM156N","POPTOTUSA647NWDB"])
df.columns = ['housing','population']
df.asfreq(freq='A',method='bfill').pct_change().mean()*100
```

Homer Simpson as an Avenger.. great idea. Marvel already cannot sink
any lower.

NPR: "[2019] Homer Simpson probably won't become the newest member of
the Avengers, but anything's possible now that Disney owns 21st
Century Fox. One year after the Walt Disney Co. announced the $71.3
billion merger, it's official"

Latent space is usually a reduced dimension, sometimes a decomposition
of another space. I could decompose 6 into 3 times 2, maybe that tells
us something.. Can decompose a matrix, we can look at individual
pieces for more clues, each piece could be seen as a latent space.

---

LLM can be useful for a sort of glorifed search where "chatting" with
the thing actually searches in "a latent space" as Howard calls it, a
likely useful compressed space of knowledge that might give you better
results compared to a regular search. LLM is not thinking, it is
merely indexing knowledge, that could be useful in limited, focused
applications.

"@baldur@toot.cafe

Two points [on 'AI and Lossy Bottlenecks].. 

1. A lot of previously sensible people are being swept up by the AI
bubble.

2. The ideas in this post are literally a mechanism for taking away
your right to vote and replace it with a software-mediated
plutocracy...

The bubble will only get more ridiculous before it pops. We’re still
in early days yet. That somebody who is ostensibly a political
“moderate” outright advocates a system that would replace voting with
an opaque system that would inevitably be built and designed by
multinational corporations and implicitly favour their interests is
not even close to the peak of this nonsense marathon"

Listen to this guy

"AI and Lossy Bottlenecks [Schneier on Security]... Removing
democracy’s bottleneck.. the lossy bottleneck that has the largest
effect on society is in politics. It’s the same problem as the
restaurant. As a complicated citizen, your policy positions are
probably nuanced, trading off between different options and their
effects. You care about some issues more than others and some
implementations more than others. If you had the knowledge and time,
you could engage in the deliberative process and help create better
laws than exist today.. Imagine a system where AI removes this lossy
bottleneck.
