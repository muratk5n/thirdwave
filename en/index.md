The Economist: "[2011 A] sober view of globalisation deserves a wide
audience. But whether it will get it is another matter. This is partly
because 'World 3.0' is a much less exciting title than 'The World is
Flat' or 'Jihad vs. McWorld'. And it is partly because people seem to
have a natural tendency to overestimate the distance-destroying
quality of technology. Go back to the era of dictators and world wars
and you can find exactly the same addiction to globaloney. Henry Ford
said cars and planes were ‚Äúbinding the world together‚Äù. Martin
Heidegger said that ‚Äúeverything is equally far and equally
near‚Äù. George Orwell got so annoyed by all this that he wrote a
blistering attack on all the fashionable talk about the abolition of
distance and the disappearance of frontiers.. in 1944"

Hi, we're a tech startup run by libertarian Silicon Valley tech bros.

We're not a newspaper, we're a content portal.

We're not a taxi service, we're a ride sharing app.

We're not a pay TV service, we're a streaming platform.

We're not a department store, we're an e-commerce marketplace.

We're not a financial services firm, we're crypto.

We're not a space agency, we're a group of visionaries who are totally
going to Mars next year.

We're not a copywriting and graphic design agency, we're a large
language model generative AI platform.

Oh sure, we compete against those established businesses. We basically
provide the same goods and services.

But we're totally not those things. At least from a legal and PR
standpoint.

And that means all the laws and regulations that have built up over
the decades around those industries don't apply to us.

Things like consumer protections, privacy protections, minimum wage
laws, local content requirements, safety regulations, environmental
protections... They totally don't apply to us.

Even copyright laws ‚Äî as long as we're talking about everyone else's
intellectual property.

We're going to move fast and break things ‚Äî and then externalise the
costs of the things we break.

We've also raised several billion in VC funding, and we'll sell our
products below cost ‚Äî even give them away for free for a time ‚Äî until
we run our competition out of the market.

Once we have a near monopoly, we'll enshitify the hell out of our
service and jack up prices.

You won't believe what you agreed to in our terms of service
agreement.

We may also be secretly hoarding your personal information. We know
who you are, we know where you work, we know where you live. But you
can trust us.

By the time the regulators and the general public catch on to what
we're doing, we will have well and truly moved on to our next grift.

By the way, don't forget to check out our latest innovation. It's the
Uber of toothpaste!"

People are in awe of some of the freedoms enjoyed by a US film writer,
director. How can you speak against the government, hell, even the
concept of government? That has nothing to do with the "strength of
their democracy", but everything to do with the current power
structure in the country. Corporations won the war against all other
power centers in US, now through *their* movies they are rubbing
everyone else's noses in it. This is how heroes of a movie can enter a
government building with guns (lots of guns), shoot an innocent
employee (the guy wasn't overtaken by 'the Matrix' so he'd die in his
pod), and continue a rampage with big-beat dance music on full blast
in the background, bad guys are government, good guys are this rag-tag
individuals, resembling early settlers of US in the wild frontier
maybe? How nice. The audience is sold.

They make such movies because they can. They are *allowed* to make
them.

Slate: "Tesla Sold a Myth About Batteries That Everyone Wanted to Be
True.. But the problem isn‚Äôt just that Tesla hoodwinked customers,
investors, and regulators about the extent of its vehicles‚Äô real-world

pattern only fueled an even larger myth: that loading up EVs with
massive battery packs is a viable, sustainable, apple-to-apples
replacement for gas vehicles"

Miami Rice = Miami Vice

"Miami Rice Invades Haiti. In 1987, [new junta leader supported by US]
Namphy received IMF loans valued at $24.6 million in exchange for
agreeing to slash rice tariffs from 150% to 50%, the lowest in the
Caribbean. He opened all of Haiti‚Äôs ports to commercial activity and
agreed to stop what little support the government had offered Haitian
farmers. Meanwhile, Haiti‚Äôs military elite saw an opportunity to make
a profit smuggling American rice.. In the United States, the passage
of the 1985 Farm Bill significantly boosted subsidies to American rice
growers. By 1987, 40% of American rice growers' profits came from the
government. Heavily subsidized American rice could sell at prices far
below the market value of Haitian rice. Haitian farmers never stood a
chance against this unfair competition".. In Haiti, imported American
rice is called 'Miami rice' because it is shipped from Miami in sacks
stamped 'Miami, FLA.' By December 1987, Haiti‚Äôs rice production had
shrunk to 75% of Haitian needs"
