No wonder these apps are so f-ing bloated.. they have a whole freakin
browser in there!

Apparently when you click on a link in their app, another, embedded
Tiktok browser takes over, not the phone's default browser. They can
use this stealth browser to track what user does on the external site
being visited, log keystrokes, they could capture passwords, anything
they wanted.

NYT: "[2022/08] The web browser used within the TikTok app can track
every keystroke made by its users, according to new research that is
surfacing as the Chinese-owned video app grapples with U.S. lawmakers’
concerns over its data practices"

Bair: "The year 2009 brought with it a new president, Barack Obama. I
was desperately hoping that the new administration would rethink some
of the bailout policies we were pursuing and would do more to help
distressed homeowners. Unfortunately, that was not to be. President
Obama promised to launch stronger programs to prevent foreclosures,
and I really think that helping these families was a priority for
him. But I do not believe that the people he picked for major economic
positions in his administration shared those priorities.

Much to my surprise and disappointment, he picked Tim Geithner to
replace Hank Paulson as the new secretary of the Treasury. Throughout
the crisis, Tim’s singular focus had been to bail out the big banks,
and in particular, Citi. He had shown little interest in foreclosure
prevention or any other kind of direct help for Main Street. He viewed
the big banks as the center of our economy, and equated helping them
with helping the broader economy. He did not understand that their
interests and Main Street interests were separate, and that helping
big banks did not necessarily help struggling American families.

President Obama also picked Larry Summers, another close associate of
Bob Rubin, to head the National Economic Council, or “NEC,” which was
responsible for developing economic policy for the White
House. Summers had also once served as secretary of the Treasury and
had been a supporter of legislation to block regulation of the
derivatives markets. In addition, he had backed legislation to repeal
a Depression-era law called “Glass-Steagall,” which for decades had
prohibited FDIC-insured banks from engaging in risky securities
activities. Based on Summers’s record, I also viewed him as highly
sympathetic to the big banks"

Perusing Sheila Bair's book, *The Bullies of Wall Street*. Does not
look good for Geithner. Nor Summers, but we already knew he was a
jackass.

Unfettered immigration is problematic on many fronts.. First is the
mentality of who arrives. Most people fled from a place likely did not
like the government of the place they are from, so they arrive in US
not liking the concept of government. An anti-government sentiment can
spread through immigrants. Plus when they arrive they are happy to be
working at all, they do not ask anything, they are either low-wage
earners who don't complain undermining local unions, or they become
"enterpreneurs" becoming ultra pro-business jackasses of which US does
not need more of either. Any way you look at it, unfettered
immigration is a net negative.
