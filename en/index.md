[N]ew rule: if your company puts a LLM bot on the front lines of your
customer support effort, your company should be legally bound to
adhere to whatever the LLM bot states on your behalf... oh, you put a
lying machine at the front door and it's telling people your product
does things it doesn't actually do? and now you're stuck making your
product do these things? maybe you'll think twice about deploying
lying machines"

Post-2020 inflation in the West occured bcz of limited-time direct
payments to people, that money came and went, so inflation naturally
came down. People who said inflation was transitionary were right.

The FED likely wanted asset prices to come down IMO (stocks, housing)
through its rate rises but it failed to achive that objective. I
believe they realized that now, and changed course. Inequality is the
culprit. Usual mechanisms are not working. Govs need to take out
the big stick if they want to avoid pitchforks later.

Judging recent econ events through inequality prism via Stevenson;
covid payments to people, even it went to them direct, still
contributed to inequality because everything they spent ended up with
the rich anyway (through corps they own, operate, have shares of).
Now govs are in more debt and the rich are richer because on top of
their existing wealth they ended up with the covid money as
well. Direct payments were necessary but govs always "forget" the next
step of such an action, taxing the rich to plug their debt.

Stevenson prediction on house prices was their prices would not fall
in a way that would make a difference even with higher rates, because
the wealthy, with their huge stash, could still buy homes without
needing a mortgage, either directly or through various investment
vehicles, so demand stayed high, prices did not fall.

NYT is not messing around.. 

IEEE: "The battle between copyright holders and generative AI
companies is heating up, and The New York Times leading the
charge. The publication recently filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and
Microsoft that claims copyright infringement, trademark dilution, and
unfair competition. And it’s not pulling its punches. The suit seeks
not just monetary compensation but also the destruction of all the
defendant’s LLM models and training data, as well as a halt to
unlicensed training on the publication’s articles"
