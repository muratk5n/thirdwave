Andersen: "The year that manifesto was published [1984] companies
bought back only a few billion dollars’ worth of their stock, but as
the decade ended five years later, the annual average was tens of
billions. That’s when Jack Welch (Jack Welch!) announced that GE (GE!)
was going to buy back the equivalent of $21 billion worth of its own
stock because that was so much easier than 'going out and taking a
wild swing' at developing new technologies or new businesses. It was
the biggest single buyback yet. Welch was acting even more like a Wall
Street guy, and Wall Street redoubled its love for him. Unquestionably
a new party had started"

Info below addresses Mearsheimer's point too, US has been an enabler
of Israel, there is no two-state right now because noone on either
side (US, ISR) wanted it, despite declerations to the contrary. US has
aided and abetted Israel's state terrorism for decades. Ever since HW
noone truly gave them a hard-time on anything.

.. If you’re asking about powertain systems that are good for the
environment & economy and available for mass adoption now, the answer
is PHEVs and HVs as \#hydrogen production infrastructure ramps. Toyota
just coined a new axiom called the 1-6-90 rule meaning one long range
BEV could have made 6 PHEVs or 90 HVs.  The 1-6-90 rule is how we can
finally communicate that long range BEVs are not as effective for
impacting climate change goals as other technologies"

FDR was against the creation of Israel. Later Truman ok'd the
idea.. but we know his entire IRel team was against the idea, to a

a simple act of partition - against.
