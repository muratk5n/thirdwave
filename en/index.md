the 10,000 vehicles it sold in the first three months of the year,
helping to drag down earnings for the company overall"

Critics can argue whether they dislike the decision or not. My point
is it was under the realm of executive authority which was exercised
in this case. It is not easy, next to impossible to run a "deep state"
in the current US system which is good actually. But at the same time
US politicians are regularly bought out who turn around and do the
bidding of the wealthy (that is not good). In other words US' problem
is the surface state - visible people, in high office making decisions
that are against the majority's interests.

Host: "Colonel what did you make of the scenes in the house as the
Ukrainian flags were waved in apparent celebration of of signing the
check to Ukraine"

Col MacGregor: "I don't think they were really waving flags for
Ukraine, they were expressing their gratitude to donors who will
reward them for voting for this terrible bill. Probably 60 to 70% of
the cash will never reach Ukraine it'll end up being circulated
through the giant laundering machine here in Washington that moves
funds to the Department of Defense, from the Department of Defense to
military industrial production, to clients, donors, and then
eventually parts of it end up back on the Hill in people's re-election
funds.

You have to understand that most of this isn't going to have any
impact whatsoever on the battlefield in Ukraine, Ukrainians are
running out of soldiers, at this point they're losing about 500 to 800
Ukrainian soldiers a day, and the Russian offensive hasn't really
begun yet. The place is nearing collapse but I guess the point is to
try and conceal from the American public and and from the rest of the
world yet gain the immense failure of this policy of proxy war with
Russia..

How did we get to this point?.. I think you know those of us who are
old enough.. have realized that there's money to be made in a time of
war, but it's so naked now, evolved.. to such a a morally bankrupt
state of affairs. I can't speak for what the population or the
electorate is like in Great Britain but here in the United States I
think large numbers of Americans have been very complacent and by
complacency I mean haven't taken much interest in foreign and defense
policy.  The average American thinks that if you spend a dollar on
defense you get a dollar of national security at the other end of the
process, that of course is nonsense, and they don't have a real feel
for how many billions of dollars are wasted on a daily basis by the
Department of Defense..

[Some] are beginning to figure out that they have no representation in
Washington, that the parties are irrelevant, we are supposedly
governed at the behest of two parties, but in truth we have one party
it's called the Uniparty which is why there were only 21 Republicans
who refused to support the bill. There is no representation.. there
are still [those] who think that the coming election could change
something, you would think by now they would have figured out that it
doesn't make much difference who you vote for you get the same bad
outcome"
