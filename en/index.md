No expansion of the universe, no Big Bang. Cosmology is in trouble.

Paper: "We find that the UV surface brightness of luminous disk
galaxies are constant over a very wide redshift range (from z = 0.03
to z ~ 5). From this analysis we conclude that the Tolman test for
surface brightness dimming is consistent with a non-expanding,
Euclidean Universe with distance proportional to redshift. This
result is also consistent with previously published datasets that were
obtained to perform the Tolman test for a smaller redshift baseline
when analysis of such data is done in a consistent system"

Wiki: "Tolman's test compares the surface brightness of galaxies as a
function of their redshift.. Such a comparison was first proposed in
1930 by Richard C. Tolman as a test of whether the universe is
expanding or static"

Good stuff.. i recommend staying away from smartphone apps as much as
possible. Great apps can be written using pure Web tech.

"@scottjenson@social.coop

I did some #UX consulting for a non profit in Nairobi a while ago, and
in addition to various UX stuff, I suggested they use a #PWA (a simple
cached website) instead of an app.

I talked to them this morning. They shipped it and are thrilled. It's
SO much smaller than an app, a critical issue in rural Kenya, and it's
significantly easier to get people to find and install it.

So exciting when people discover the value of the standard, unfussy web"

I believe the use of the N-word is appropriate here.

This ambassador wrote an article in 2013 titled "The Five-Stage Plan
for the Greater Land of Israel". Daam.. Nazi bitch.

Informed Comment: "'Why are you obsessed with a two-state solution?'
said Tzipi Hotovely, the Israeli ambassador to the UK.. Hotovely’s
remarks triggered a swift response from the UK’s two major political
parties"
