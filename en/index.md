People who aren't from Seattle hear how much I pay for rent and I
think they spit out their drinks.

The only place he could not walk was between South Am and Antartica as
it is open ocean, they used airlift for that small piece. Good enough.

H2 View: "H2SITE Has Commissioned a Membrane Separator Capable of
Extracting 5 to 20% Hydrogen Blends at +99% Purity From the Gas
Distribution Network

- Located in Zamudio (Bizkaia), the separation unit is installed on a
  natural gas distribution network and operates with hydrogen
  concentrations ranging from 5 to 20%

- It‚Äôs the first installation using palladium-alloy membrane
  separators reaching 97% hydrogen recovery rate at +99% purity"

Nature: "Direct solar-driven water splitting by photocatalysis or
photoelectrolysis offers a very promising route to produce green
hydrogen. Among different configurations of photoactive materials, the
bioinspired concept of 'Z-scheme photoactive film' enables
visible-light-driven water splitting by combining two different
photoactive materials in series to separately produce H2 and O2 in
tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells or photocatalytic panels has
demonstrated its great effectivenss. Their scale-up and commercial
applications though require low-cost, stable, efficient, and scalable
photoactive films...

Inspired by the cellular structure of the thylakoid membrane of
chloroplasts in plant cells.. in this study, a facile and scalable
particle-implanting (PiP) fabrication technique of embedding
semiconductor particles in low-melting-point (LMP) liquid metal
matrixes was developed to produce bioinspired photoactive films"

I axed one of those chat parrots to categorize a text about a criminal
getting a sentence due past hard crimes in an actor-action-actor
format, like GDELT does for news items, basically asking for "A does B
to C" type of output. Chat parrot totally made up one side of the
action, said "families of the victims" brought the guy to court, the
text had none of that. Related news on that exact event elsewhere had
none of that. That answer was likely computed based on the gobs of
texts it ingested earlier on similar stories, which led the parrot to
hallucinate.
