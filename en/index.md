Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

"Downstream benefits of business activity".. how do you measure that?
In terms of fish in the Hudson River? Such activity clearly did not
work for them, or for people who lived off the river. This the most
advanced country in the world. I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't
lived near the fucking thing myself.

There is nothing sacred about work, that is a ruse created for the
business class so they can remain "in charge" (so they get credit
which they use to pay salaries). Work should not equal pay. As long as
new money is created exclusively for business as credit, working class
and humanity at large will never know peace. Have no doubt - these
people will kill you. With money they can buy influence, pollute your
rivers, your children's brains, even the very air your
breathe. They've already done this. Noone should require any more
proof than what has already taken place. New money creation needs to
be split at the very least, evenly between credit and salary. If that
means reduction in "business activity", that might be a good
thing. Less Coca-Cola, more fruits and vegetables perhaps. Less private
property more public parks. Who kwows?

Sad and absurd but true: holiday periods encapsulate 90% of academic

Russia is a huge country, there are many regions who are regionally
distinct, they can maintain culture. Russia calling itself
multicultural is different than US using the same term whose people
are intertwined, are always on the move.

Culture is about numbers and proximity due to its subconcious
transmission. By numbers I'm talking big numbers, state-level big, or
a country level big as in Europe. Millions of Lithuenians in US living
close proximity in one state can maintain culture. Interspersed among
the larger populace they cannot. They could create ritual around their
culture to maintain it mumble stupid shit to themselves in Lithuenian
prayers put funky Lithuenian hats on their heads, it won't work.
