Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

There is bizarre ideas on population growth and its place in
economics..  Some keep arguing more people are needed for growth, but
that is mainly a right-wing argument, they just want cheap labor, more
people competing for jobs is good for them as they root for the
bosses, "the supply side". See below, povery *caused* population
growth. Population growth in the industrial age did not fuel the
industrial age, it was the result of it. Econ growth does not need
numbers, it needs know-how. You don't need more workers to pay for
retirees. Current accounting can tell you that, but that system is
set up incorrectly.

*The Limits to Growth, the 30 Year Update*: In poor
countries.. [b]ecause immediate requirements leaves little output for
industrial investment, the economy grows only slowly. The demographic
transition stays stuck in the middle phase, with a large gap between
birth and death rates. When women see no attractive educational or
economic alternatives to childbearing, children are one of the few
forms of investment available; thus the population grows bigger
without growing richer.  As the saying goes, 'The rich get richer and
the poor get children.'

International gatherings can become paralyzed by passionate
arguments.. Poverty causes population growth, or population growth
causes poverty.. By drawing output away from investment and into
consumption, population growth slows capital growth. Poverty, in turn,
perpetuates population growth by keeping people in conditions where
they have no education, no health care, no family planning, no
choices, no power, no way to get ahead except to hope their children
can bring in income or help with family labor...

Food production in every part of the South has increased greatly over
the past 20 years. In most places it has doubled or tripled. But
because of rapid population growth, food production per person has
barely improved, and in Africa it has steadily decreased. The only
places where food production has noticeably kept ahead of population
growth are Europe and the Far East.  The graphs in figure 2-12 show a
double tragedy. The first is a human one. A great agricultural
achievement, a tremendous increase in food production, has been
largely absorbed not in feeding people more adequately but in feeding
more people inadequately. The second tragedy is environmental. The
increase in food production has been attained by policies that damaged
soils, waters, forests, and ecosystems, a cost that will make future
production increases more difficult.

But any positive feedback loop that grinds a system down can be turned
around to lift the system up. More poverty means more population,
which means more poverty. But less poverty means slower population
growth, which means less poverty. With enough investment sustained for
a long enough time, with fair pricing for products and labor, with
increasing output allocated much more directly to the poor, and
especially to the education and employment of women and to family
planning, the effects of the population–poverty loop can be
reversed"

Energy Voice: "Namibia’s cabinet has approved an agreement with Hyphen
Hydrogen Energy on a $10 billion project. The plan is for sub-Saharan
Africa’s largest – and only fully vertically integrated – green
hydrogen project. At peak, the facility should produce 2 million
tonnes per year of green ammonia for regional and global markets"
