We *absolutely* cannot negotiate with the physics.

Pay attention to the instruments.

Satellite Data: Unreflected incoming absorbed solar radiation
*exceeds* the outgoing heat radiation.

As a result we are heating and, it would seem when looking at the
recent data, at an accelerating rate"

Favourite thing I've learned in 2023: Rosenthaler Platz U-Bahn station
in Berlin is entirely decorated with radioactive uranium glazed tiles.

Prefering web tech over phone-specific app platform makes it easy to
port software from one device to another. The application becomes
instantly portable because every phone has a browser which can run
standard web application code. You avoid corporate lock-in, utilize
open technologies that are well documented, easy to use and fast.

You can get rid of the Central Bank change the currency of the country
to someone else's, you can do it, and it can help with
inflation. Bulgaria switched to the Euro their inflation fell. But
that's only half the story. Central Banks are there to fund banks, if
something goes wrong with them, with customer deposits and the like,
CB can print / lend to save the banks. Bulgaria is part of the EU, can
rely on ECB for that. Who's gonna save your ass son? Planning on
relying a distant CB that is not even in the same continent as
Argentina? You can rely on them if you become their bitch, that's
probably why the jerkoff from Arkansas is there, to shmooze and blow
smoke up your ass, to help you become a satellite. That was a Soviet
term..  let's say "a client state".

Slate: "We are now witnessing a five-car pileup of Trump–slash–Jan. 6
cases that will either be heard by the Supreme Court or land on their
white marble steps in the coming weeks. The court has already agreed
to hear the case of Joseph Fischer, the former Pennsylvania cop
accused of taking part in the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol and
assaulting police officers, to determine the scope of prosecutions for
obstructing an official proceeding. The court’s already flirting with
hearing a direct appeal by special counsel Jack Smith to speedily
resolve Trump’s claims to absolute immunity for his actions in
attempting to overturn the 2020 election. And a game-changer of a case
came out of the Colorado Supreme Court on Tuesday that would knock the
former president off of the Republican primary ballot in that state as
a consequence of his involvement in the insurrection attempt on
Jan. 6, which would also critically apply to the general election
ballot next November. That ruling has to be settled by the high
court in order to forestall, or affirm, other states’ efforts to do
the same thing. Potential appeals of gag orders in criminal
suits and doofy immunity claims in the E. Jean Carroll suit are all
also winging their way to Chief Justice John Roberts’ workstation, and
it’s not even 2024 yet"
