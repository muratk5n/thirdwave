Software is now (rightfully) considered so dangerous that we tell
everyone not to run it themselves. Instead, you are supposed to leave
that to an 'as a service' provider, or perhaps to 'the cloud'...

The assumption is then that 'the cloud' is somehow able to turn
insecure software into a secure service. Yet even the past year, we’ve
learned that Microsoft’s email platform was thoroughly hacked, down to
classified government email (update: it happened again!). There are
also well-founded worries about the security of the Azure
cloud. Meanwhile, industry darling Okta, which provides LOG IN
SOLUTIONS got comprehensively owned. This was their second breach
within a year. Also, there was a suspicious spate of Okta users
getting hacked subsequently"

CH's A2/AD investments, its big navy, big as in numbers not
necessarily deep sea faring capability, makes more sense for a
regional blockade scenario too. In a hot war many actors in the area
can take potshots at them. With a blockade countries must decide
specifically to break blockade and risk escalation.

Jestrab: "Much of the public discussion around a China-Taiwan conflict
centers on an invasion; however, a number of factors make this the
least likely scenario. The primary reason why an invasion scenario is
unlikely is that it runs contrary to the PRC’s strategic objectives
and reasons for seeking unification. An invasion would result in
significant direct physical violence against the people of Taiwan, the
population that the CCP seeks to rule. Additionally, the PRC gives
priority to economic development as a 'central task' of its continued
growth. An invasion would certainly result in harm to the Chinese
economy due to international sanctions and significant destruction to
Taiwan’s infrastructure and economy.

Geographic factors also make an invasion difficult, including the fact
that two-thirds of the country is rugged mountains and 80 percent of
the population lives in urban environments. Achieving success during
an invasion would likely require preemptive attacks on US and allied
forces, and there would be limited de-escalation options if this
occurred. The historical precedent is that the United States is highly
committed to wars it enters after being attacked. Unlike an invasion
scenario, a blockade could be reversable, and the level of force used
could be adjusted...

A blockade is the most likely and dangerous scenario, due to
Taiwan’s reliance on maritime trade to sustain its economic
prosperity. Moreover, a nonkinetic blockade is appealing to the PRC,
as it is the lowest level of coercive action that could remain below
the threshold of open hostilities and still achieve its national
objectives...

A successful blockade disrupting maritime trade would shutter Taiwan’s
economy. Rationing of scarce energy and food reserves, amplified by a
lack of viable resupply plans, would generate fear and uncertainty
among the Taiwanese population — in sustaining their lives, getting
their next meal, and maintaining their personal economic security. The
PRC’s actions would grind day- to-day life on the island to a
halt. Democracy is more sensitive to economic disruptions than other
forms of government, and a successful blockade could result in panic"

Paper by Marek Jestrab claims a blockade of Taiwan is more likely than
an Chinese invasion of Taiwan. That sounds right.

TDB: "If there was ever a state that Nikki Haley could win, New
Hampshire would have been it (and no, avoiding a landslide loss
doesn’t count). Assuming her candidacy continues.. it won’t get any
easier from here... It’s over"

---

A win is still a win. Plus it was Haley who had to win this one to
matter in the race. NH electorate on paper should have favored her
more. Democrat leaning less conservative state right? If she won NH
she could have spun that "see I can win among Dem leaning elect, and
I'm conservative enough, so vote for me". The plan did not work.
