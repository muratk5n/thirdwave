Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

The events that led to this point were crazy; the meatgrinder of
Brexit destroyed one politician after another, finally ending up with
Sunak at that coronation. Tories will be trounced in the next general
due to previous chaos unrelated with Sunak, but at least there will be
some competency in the office, your country will not burn in this last
stretch of conservative government. Hey it could have been Lettuce Liz
at that coronation - label pinned by the colorful Brit media, meaning
a lettuce would outlast the former PM -they were proven right-.

"UK multiculturalism" where your PM of Indian ethnic origin (who is
culturally English) reads a passage from the bible at the English
king's coronation. Feel the power of diversity.

Return to what? To 2010 pre-war conditions? He should have those
"concessions" considering many other countries contributed to the
mess up that is now. I for one don't want millions of f-ing refugees
in my native homeland. My people are not rich.

"The turning point in the American-Iranian relationship was not, as
the official version would have it, the election of Hassan Rouhani in
June 2013. It was the reelection of Barack Obama in November 2012. 
Indeed, the first secret meeting with the Iranians.. took place
even earlier, in early July 2012, eleven months before Rouhani came to
power. Jake Sullivan.. traveled secretly to Oman to meet with Iranian
officials...  Most pertinent is the timing. At that moment, pressure
was mounting on the president to intervene in Syria. Sullivan probably
briefed the Iranians on Obama’s strong desire to stay out of that
conflict"
