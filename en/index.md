Quora: "'Why is the depreciation curve for BEVs steeper? What's with
this rationale that BEV technology ages faster?'..

My guesses for why BEVs depreciate faster:

- Battery longevity past eight year warranty is still up in the air..

- BEV-exclusive components / parts are more expensive

- Longer wait time for repairs and fewer options

- Reduction in driving range due to inevitable degradation..

- (empty?) promises in upcoming battery chemistry improvements..

- Less demand - significant premium over ICEV, limited form factors,
  creeping insurance premiums

Labour kneecapped its own candidate over Israel, and lost the seat
to a bigger anti-genocide candidate.. It is poetic justice.

Al-Jazeera: "George Galloway who campaigned against Gaza war wins UK
by-Galloway won the seat in the northern English town of Rochdale
after a fractious campaign, which saw the Labour Party withdraw
support from its candidate over his anti-Israel comments"
