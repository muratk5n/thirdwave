Actually I was unfair, LLMs are not as smart as an hamster.. An
hamster is still smarter than these "AI" algorithms. I meant LLM
*processing power* is similar to an hamster. But since their
algorithms are shit, inefficient, the result is colorful, sometimes
creative, parroty junk. It can sound smart, but boy, when it takes a
wrong turn, it all goes down the cliff.. A hamster is absolutely
smarter than any neural network based approach currently in use.

Green.. who do they work for? All they do is day trade.. Nancy too of
course. But there are people who make *more* money than her, strangely
enough.

This is the author of the NYT opinion piece shared before, the health
insurance exec. Dug it up from my archives, 2020.

"[2020] @wendellpotter@twitter.com

Amid America's \#COVID19 disaster, I must come clean about a lie I
spread as a health insurance exec: We spent big [dollars] to push the
idea that Canada's single-payer system was awful & the U.S. system
much better. It was a lie"
