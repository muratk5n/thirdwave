Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

areas to the North and South of it; see areas taken in 2023,
Krasnopolivka, Blahodatne are gone, RU is now approaching Serebryanka.

The Iraq Study Group Report

[PDF](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-IRAQSTUDYGROUP/pdf/GPO-IRAQSTUDYGROUP.pdf)

---

The Doran article details how WH stuck to its Iran policy; and likely
forces both internal and external actively tried to undermine this
thawing of relations, and the conflict in ME became more complicated,
and deadly because of it. Secret intel sharing would complicate things
further and obviously help Assad.

Michael Doran: "When [Obama] arrived in Washington in 2006, he
absorbed a set of ideas that had incubated on Capitol Hill during the
previous three years—ideas that had received widespread attention
thanks to the final report of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan
congressional commission whose co-chairs, former secretary of state
James Baker and former Indiana congressman Lee Hamilton, interpreted
their mission broadly, offering advice on all key aspects of Middle
East policy.. The report, published in December 2006, urged
then-President Bush to take four major steps: withdraw American troops
from Iraq; surge American troops in Afghanistan; reinvigorate the
Arab-Israeli 'peace process'; and, last but far from least, launch a
diplomatic engagement of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its junior
partner, the Assad regime in Syria. Baker and Hamilton believed that
Bush stood in thrall to Israel and was therefore insufficiently alive
to the benefits of cooperating with Iran and Syria. Those two regimes,
supposedly, shared with Washington the twin goals of stabilizing Iraq
and defeating al-Qaeda and other Sunni jihadi groups. In turn, this
shared interest would provide a foundation for building a concert
system of states—a club of stable powers that could work together to
contain the worst pathologies of the Middle East and lead the way to a
sunnier future.

Expressing the ethos of an influential segment of the foreign-policy
elite, the Baker-Hamilton report became the blueprint for the foreign
policy of the Obama administration, and its spirit continues to
pervade Obama’s inner circle. Denis McDonough, now the president’s
chief of staff, once worked as an aide to Lee Hamilton; so did
Benjamin Rhodes, who helped write the Iraq Study Group’s report. Obama
not only adopted the blueprint but took it one step further,
recruiting Vladimir Putin’s Russia as another candidate for membership
in the new club. The administration’s early 'reset' with Russia and
its policy of reaching out to Iran and Syria formed two parts of a
single vision"

It's not too far fetched post 2013 admin helped Assad through
backchannels, closer rels with Iran, Syria, Russia were part of their
plan.
