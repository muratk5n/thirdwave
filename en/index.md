Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Data Scientist: "My custom [code] uses high resolution radar data
collected in 2000 by the Space Shuttle Endeavor. For about 18GB of
hard drive space, the SRTM GL3 dataset covers nearly 120M square
kilometers of Earth’s landmass in 90m increments... It is interesting
to note that Google currently charges $5 per 1000 requests to their
Elevation API, but thanks to NASA and a few lines of code, we can get
the same high-quality results, free of charge"

The COVID national emergency was ended in Apr 11, could've been to
stave off \#RK attacks from that direction, maybe the Biden team is
worried a little.

\#RFKj is clearly a Trump-inspired Kennedy.

These people come out of the woodwork.. there is a Kennedy for every
kind of political situation, any shape, size; there is a tall Kennedy,
a short Kennedy, I'm sure if the situation called for it there is a
midget Kennedy somewhere. Biden made a mistake building up the
family's image, the myth, hoping to gain legitimacy by displaying a
connection to it, but then the genuine item can show up and gobble up
your shit. Now \#RK says in an interview "Biden has my father's bust
behind him in every WH picture" so you handed a Kennedy an advantage -
why bother with the guy merely standing in front of the bust when
there is the actual son in the running?
