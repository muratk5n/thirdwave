Iselin: "If you think Tesla’s Q1 earnings were bad, and its deliveries
awful, wait until you hear about the odometer scandal. What could end
up as Tesla’s Dieselgate (the VW emissions scandal) is a direct
assault on the one thing Tesla can’t afford to lose: trust. The
numbers are grim, the leadership is distracted, and now the company
stands accused of manipulating odometers (by up to 117%!) to dodge
warranty repairs"

LiveScience: "Scientists think a hidden source of clean energy could
power Earth for 170,000 years — and they've figured out the 'recipe'
to find it.. Researchers have compiled a list of 'ingredients' that
could help resource exploration companies locate huge reservoirs of
clean hydrogen, a critical element in the transition away from fossil
fuels.. Recent breakthroughs suggest that hydrogen reservoirs are
buried in countless regions of the world, including at least 30
U.S. states"

restore it,' Jianwei Xu, senior economist at Natixis"

The Times of Israel: "Trump slams ‘neocons’ and ‘interventionists’
during Riyadh speech.. 'It’s crucial for the wider world to know this
great transformation [in the Middle East] has not come from Western
interventionists, or flying people in beautiful planes giving you
lectures on how to live and how to govern your own affairs,' Trump
says. 'In the end, the so-called nation builders wrecked far more
nations than they built and the interventionalists were intervening in
complex societies that they did not even understand themselves,' he
continues"
