Gary Stevenson: "When you live in a very wealth, unequal
society.. that means is a small group of people own all of the
companies, they own all of the commercial property, they own most of
the properties. And ordinary people are continually having to pay them
rents, profits and interest. If inequality gets very large, these
flows of cash from ordinary families to the rich become very large.
[Then three things happen] One is ordinary people work much more for
the rich, although in reality, if you try and do that, it tends to
just push wages down.  Two is ordinary families sell their assets to
the rich, and that is why we are seeing reduced homeownership rates
and reduced ability to save in pensions.  But the third one is the
rich can lend that money back to the poor. And that is what we're
seeing when we see mortgage sizes increase.  What you are seeing there
is the rich taking enormous amounts of money from working families and
then lending it back...

During Covid, governments gave out an enormous amount of money. And
that money was largely, in the end, accumulated by richer people...
When these rich people started to accumulate cash, what do they do?..
They tend to want to own a balanced portfolio..  They want to own
things like stocks and shares..  They want to own property as well..
But the problem with property is it's very difficult for super rich
people to buy enormous amounts of property...  So what do rich people
do?..  If I had Â£500,000 cash and I wanted to buy a property, I could
go out and spend Â£500,000, buy a flat in London.  Â£500,000 is kind of
roughly what a flat in London costs nowadays.  I could rent it to my
sister and she could pay me rent every month.  Alternatively, I could
lend that money to my sister.  She could go out and buy the house
herself, and then she could pay me interest every month.  How are
these two things different to me?

Well, the first thing I want to point out is, what is the difference
between those two examples on the housing market and on house prices?
The answer is that is exactly no difference.  You know the housing
market doesn't see whether it's me or whether it's my sister, whether
I'm buying directly or whether I'm lending to my sister.  All the
housing market sees is somebodyâ€™s coming in with Â£500,000 and buying a
house.

So what that shows you is whether I buy the house directly or whether
I lend the money out to buy the house.  In both cases, I drive the
house price up.  The second thing is this question of who actually
owns the house.  So legally, technically, if I lent the money to my
sister, my sister owns the house.  But what is her net worth after she
buys it?  Well, she buys a flat that's worth Â£500,000.  She has debt
of Â£500,000.  She's worth nothing.  So, essentially, I own the equity
in the house..

Mortgage lending and the accumulation of credit by the rich is the way
in which rich people buy houses.  And if you are sitting on a house
with an enormous mortgage, realistically you don't own that house.
The person who lent you the money owns that house.  And it's important
to understand this because as we go forward, this increased size of
mortgage is going to be the primary way in which we see the wealth of
the middle class decline"

Russian oligarchs can qualify for the $5 million residency gold cards..

If I were them I would not apply, there is no telling what can happen
when shitlib Dems are in power, they might go after those same Russian
oligarchs with even bigger zeal just bcz Trump let them in. They are
still hung up on that Russian angle, starting with Russiagate so
forth, now if Trump is again not antagonistic towards Russia, they
will have to be.

I propose a new hero - Nativeman. He is born smack in the middle of US
(Kansas?). Nativeman will be super powerful at that location, as he
moves away from there, he starts losing his power. Like, when he
reaches either shore he can't even pass gas. In Kansas he can lift a
truck. And he wants big government, because he is local.

I hope Superman cannon w/ the upcoming movie does not stress his
"foreignness". We have to realize a part of SM is immigrant
propaganda.. The alien arrives from *another* planet to America, he
has super powers *on his new home*, on Earth (wink wink, we know where
they really mean, US), right? The whole shabang with the yellow Sun vs
the red Sun? The immigrant is powerful in US, not back home, he is
normal there. The message corporate America wants to send is we *want*
foreigners, please arrive on our shores *where you will be special*,
leave home where you are nothing. And well since you are special, you
won't need social services, social help and infrastructure - hell, you
can fly over buildings boy! You don't need government! You can *be*
government with those super duper powers!

"@waeiski@vis.social

It is now illegal to transmit personal information of EU citizens to
cloud infrastructure in the #US as they won't be protected by the
\#GDPR. Many European service providers will have to move quickly to
avoid fines, but eventually #EU data will be held in the EU.. That
means AWS, Azure, Google and iCloud can lose a sizeable chunk of their
customer base if no moves are made. I am all for it"
