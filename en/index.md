Standards. Free, Open Source. Files. Directories. Simple File Servers.
It's a thing.

---

Most modern web servers allow this, can skip ahead to specific
location in a file. Any OS worth its salt can do that for its local
file access, RFC 9110 simply provides a web interface.

---

There was a massive binary file sitting on a simple file server
(terrain data). Downloading it all to client is no go. The alternative
u compute direct index access and read specific bytes only, and do
this via 100+ micro requests, then combine data on the client. No need
to dload, best part no need for an app server - a whole seperate
service responding to complex requests. 

---

I finally got to use the Web standard RFC 9110 -range requests- in a
serious app.

Second installation, so so.. the third, really bad. Check [this out](https://cdn.fosstodon.org/media_attachments/files/112/613/517/112/417/913/original/aaf7082098b51d02.jpg).
F-ing Van Wilders in the cast... How could it not suck? Where was
the Volkswagen hat?

The first *Blade* was great, Wesley Snipes was fantastic in the role.

It don't matter if you are black or white, you'll get cucked all the
same. Woke knows no bounds.

---

Another Marvel screw up. The chatter has it the studio wants Woke, but
Ali is resisting.

Kotaku: "Marvel’s upcoming *Blade* movie is back in the news and yet
again it isn’t for good reasons. Yann Demange (‘71 and *Lovecraft
Country*) has left the project as director, which marks the second
director to exit the film in three years. This is the latest setback
for the project, which was announced in 2019 with much anticipation as
it would see Oscar winner Mahershala Ali take on the role"
