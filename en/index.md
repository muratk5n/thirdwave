Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

The Geopolitica: "The United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Germany Will
Invest $34 billion In a Green Hydrogen Project in Mauritania.. [A]
German investment company, Conjuncta, along with the United Arab
Emirates renewable energy firm Masdar, and Egyptâ€™s renewable energy
firm Infinity have signed an agreement with the Mauritanian government
to build a 34 billion green hydrogen plant with an electrolyzer
capacity of up to 10 gigawatts near the Mauritanian capital,
Nouakchott. Every year, the green hydrogen plant will produce 8
million tonnes of ammonia or other hydrogen-based products along with
green hydrogen. The plantâ€™s first phase will be going to be completed
by 2028 with a planned capacity of 400 megawatts"

Modern system is not built for direct democracy. Half-assed attempt to
coexist within the current system will make things worse.  Good
leadership has better chance for improv rather than crowd wisdom (!)
at policy level.

voters from challenging state laws via referendum"

Keynes' idea for a world currency [Bancor](0119/2019/06/bancor.html)
did not use gold either.

---

Some news suggest gold the new BRICS currency could be backed by gold;
if true gold would be there to provide convertibility assurance to
non-BRICS currencies. A global, dominant currency does not need gold -
Nixon's petrodollar did not need it, he was like I have my military
and an agreement with the top oil producer to keep it legit.

Kubrick apparently used Arthur C. Clarke's story as a front to get
funding, but visually hid / encoded a less rosy picture about the
future in it.

Story has down days, up days, ends up in the same place.. -10 plus +10
equals zero. But all kinds of drama in between, that surely benefits
some.

If the abortion issue was so important Dems could've codified Roe in
law with 2009-10 supermajority. They didn't because it was better to
exploit the issue firing up the donor base taking their money rather
than solving the problem. It's still the Dick Morris [plan](2021/10/all-too-human.html#triangulation),
on major issues it is uniparty, for others manufactured heated "debates",
schisms, abt "5G" issues - Guns Gays Gender God Green.

Let's not forget about the self-reinforcing effect of inflation,
excess wage increases is not the only culprit.
