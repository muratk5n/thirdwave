With `feedparser` the `post['media_content'][i]` gives the i'th media

Why implement a Web RSS reader for all my Masto follows based on the
CSV export of follows? Because I can. Open source, open data rules.

Business Green: "[A] 2021 survey of 738 climate economics papers from
top academic journals found that the median prediction of economists
was that 3°C of warming would reduce global GDP by just five per cent,
and a warming of 5°C would only see a 10 per cent reduction"

Oliver Stone is a milquetoast critic, dabbles in conspiracies on JFK
implying gov had an hand in his death (untrue, JFK was an incompetent
jackass managed got himself shot, all by himself) his work jives well with
the [grand bargain](2023/06/evil-geniuses.html#bargain). Corporations
like his movies, he is useful, so he is allowed to do what he
does. Maybe *Wall Street* could've made a difference, but Stone made
Gekko look cool - failed. Michael Douglas says he runs into finance
types all the time and they tell him "they loved that Gekko character
and want to be like him". GG was supposed to be the bad guy in that
work. O.S.  milquetoast production failed to stress it.

The Matrix symbolizes government - it is "everywhere", defines the
rules, bureucratic, "opressive".  Then ragtag freedom fighters, rebel
simple humans, like early US adventerous settlers?, are idolized, when
they rebel with guns -the right loves that part- it is almost like an
mental orgasm for them, it is very cool. The cultural left is happy
too because it is, well, opressive government like in 1973, ew like
Nixon or something (who ended the Vietnam war but whatever).. It is
not just films, games that causes the shooting phenomena I want to
make that clear, the pro-market anti-gov ideology is everywhere (the
real Matrix?), which is funded, nurtured by private interests. This
ideology, on its fringes, will cause school shootings. Said interests
are squarely responsible for the deaths of those kids.

---

A public school is a government run institution, so gun violence there
is like a mini-attack against the government. Kids learn who the bad
guy is through their media, popular culture, or the political
discourse which seeps through to them through grown ups, some on the
extremes can apply it in real life. Parkland, Columbine were both
public high schools. The kids who did the shooting at Columbine maybe
were acting out the lobby scene from *The Matrix*.

"[A researcher looked at] 134 [US] school shootings from 2000 to

PV Magazine: "Inner Mongolia University researchers have reported that
the Klebsiella pneumoniae Y7-3 strain, isolated from sheep rumen, can
directly produce high-yield hydrogen using inexpensive straw as a raw
material. The strain increased hydrogen production by 15.03% compared
to the control group using corn stalk and yeast powder. The
researchers published their findings in Energy, stating that anaerobic
fermentation with 50 g L−1 of corn straw as the carbon source could
produce 1253.72 ± 55.67 mL/L of hydrogen in 24 hours"
