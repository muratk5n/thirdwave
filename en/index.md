WaPo: "Trump slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday
for suggesting that the end of Russia’s war against Ukraine likely “is
still very, very far away.” The comments come as prominent Trump

approach to the US president, who has made quickly ending the war a
top priority, or step aside"

Westenberg: "My current project: I've been dusting off the old hard
drives with my ripped CD collection and loading them into an iPod. A
20-year-old piece of tech with its click wheel intact, no WiFi, and no
algorithm feeding me recommendations I didn't ask for. The result:
I've started listening to music - actually listening to it - in a way
I haven't in years. Giving it my attention. Not taking it for granted,
not treating it like day old shrimp at a discount buffet...

You hit a certain point, and you stop playing along. You start to see
through the 'creator economy' that turns creative people into gig
workers, underpaid and overexposed. You see through the 'community'
pitches that are just data-harvesting schemes. You see through the
hype cycles of unbundling and rebundling, decentralizing and
centralizing that - somehow - always end with a handful of dudes in
Silicon Valley holding all the keys."
