Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

R. Reich could be right; celebs doesn't want a blue check but e-jagoff
gave them one anyway paying out of pocket indicating celeb paid and
endorsed the gonzo system when they didn't, isn't that fraud under the
FTC Act? Past deeds as CEO might need some investigating.

But it gets even better; pesticide DDT is banned in US but you might
buy an apple shipped from another country produced via the DDT which
US sold them. Ain't that grand? Bidness always makes money one way or
another. People also get poisoned, one way or another.
