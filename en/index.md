Summary of the i24 report (link below): Qatar bought a power plant and
was buying fuel from Egypt for it for Hamas who collected the resale
money for public servant pay. Oil price rose, resale did not make much
money so Hamas held up another Qatar aid package for more money even
organized some riots to make a point..

Looks like things were getting tense from all directions.. Ultra-religious
zealot admin for Israel, rising oil price, Gulf raproachement with unpredictable
results for Palestine, and the ever-present prison-like conditions in Gaza
and creeping settler expansionism, plus apartheid. Why did the attacks happen
now? The better question is why isn't there an outburst / attack every
day of the week?

Arafat was poisoned BTW

What a progression of jackasses, one after another... I remember this
era, "get rid of Arafat and all will be fine" phase.

Today [Oct 15] in 1994, 29 years ago: Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin and
Shimon Peres receive the Nobel Peace Prize for their role in the
establishment of the Oslo Accords and the framing of future
Palestinian self government"

.. I once had a consulting gig with the TSA which required an in-depth
background check that included an hours-long interview.. The final q
was, 'Are you now, or have you ever been a member of an organization
which advocates the use of violence to overthrow governments.'

We had just hung Saddam Hussein three days before. It took all of my
self control not to say, 'Well, I told you I'm an American citizen,
didn't I?', instead of, 'No, sir.'"

@tess The British Empire carved up its territories using the 70/25/5
rule: a 70% majority, taxed and worked for profit, plus a 25% minority
from another ethnic group, armed with whips/clubs/rifles and enlisted
as a middle class and tax collectors, ruled over by a 5% elite of
British colonial administrators and soldiers with Gatling guns and
artillery (in case of a 25% uprising). The empire then left behind new
nations with built-in ethnic strife: a poor 2/3 majority vs. a
less-poor 1/3 minority"

"@tess@mastodon.social

If you want to know the root cause of any inter-ethnic strife or
genocide in the modern world, 'the British' is usually a pretty safe
bet"
