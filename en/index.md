Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Trillion dollar industry BTW, people in it look *employed* and the
businesses they are in get *credit*. "To look after old people we need
more young workers", then they go into this business.. Truly a bizarro
system.. You might as well pay people to dig up holes and re-fill them.

Is there *anything* this shit is good for? Nutritious value = zero.
Potential health damage = high. "Well but there is water in it that is
kinda good?" No. It causes dedydration \\(ツ)/ eyyy (medi shrug™).

"A can of soda may seem to quench your thirst, but the caffeine
contained in most popular drinks is a diuretic, which can cause
dehydration. The high levels of sodium and sugar in soda can also
contribute to dehydration"

Why bother half of it will be under water w 7m water level
rise.. You'll be confined to a 100m radius circle but hey, maybe you
can get billionaire friends and do a big circle jerk there in keeping

Physics Today: "A water-splitting reactor, located in the parabolic
dish at its focal spot.. is solar powered and also.. generates
heat... The system collects and concentrates solar light with a
7-m-diameter parabolic dish (shown above and in a simplified schematic
below). Installed on the EPFL’s main campus, it tracks the Sun’s
movement across the sky. A steady stream of tap water is then sent to
the reactor’s electrolyzer subsystem, where it’s split with solar
energy to generate hydrogen. Before reaching the electrolyzer, the
water is heated as it passes through the solar reactor—specifically, a
light homogenizer, photovoltaic module, and light shield. The
researchers intentionally designed the system to generate heat, which
not only accelerates the water-splitting reaction but also can be used
for warming water and other elements.

Haussener and coauthor Saurabh Tembhurne have founded an energy
company called SoHHytec and are now developing a prototype system
based on their design that simultaneously produces hydrogen, oxygen,
electricity, and heat. They’re also designing it so that multiple
systems can be linked to scale to the energy demands of the
application"

Governor Gretchen Whitmer takes a ride on the Flint MTA’s new hydrogen
fuel cell bus on Wednesday, April 26, 2023, at a Mass Transit
Authority facility in Grand Blanc Township. Flint will be replacing
its last two diesel buses with hydrogen fuel cell powered buses
completing its transition to clean energy public transportation"

The Detroit News: "The [$400 million] project from Nel Hydrogen,
intended to produce renewable hydrogen, would be the largest of its
kind in the country and is expected to create 500 jobs at a

the company had decided to build another plant in the United States
because of new federal incentives passed through the Inflation

AP: "[Australian Prime Minister] Albanese’s comments Friday in an
Australian Broadcasting Corp. interview appeared to escalate
diplomatic pressure on the United States to drop the charges against
the 51-year-old Assange, who has spent four years in Britain’s
Belmarsh Prison fighting extradition to the United States. Before
that, Assange had taken asylum for seven years in the Ecuadorian
Embassy in London.

Albanese said Assange’s case had to be examined in terms of whether
the time Assange had “effectively served” was in excess of what would
be 'reasonable' if the allegations against him were proved. ''I just
say that enough is enough. There is nothing to be served by his
ongoing incarceration,' Albanese said"
