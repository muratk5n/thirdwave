This would be at least the second time that Google has been caught
faking an AI demo, right? Or are there more beyond Duplex and the
dodgy Nemesis video?"

Macro Polo: "Unbeknownst to many, China already makes more than 40% of
the world’s electrolyzers. When it comes to alkaline electrolyzers,
China is even more dominant with more than 60% of the global
manufacturing capacity..

One factor behind China’s impressive electrolyzer production capacity
is that long [.. ago] China was already using hydrogen extensively to
produce polysilicon, a key input for photovoltaic cell
manufacturing. It comes as no surprise, then, that some of China’s
biggest electrolyzer producers are also major solar companies such as
LONGi and Sungrow Power"

Yes but that presupposes a system of law that is abided, agreed upon
by all parties and the society in general. Where that exists, the
outliers can be subject to a certain procedure... For ISR/Palestine no
such backdrop, agreement exists. Israel does not follow UNSC
resolutions, international law. UNSC Res 446 (stop settlement
activity), or 2334. UNSC Res 478, 497..  UNSC does not recognize the
situation created in Jerusalem and Golan Heights.  Israel is an
apartheid state which is a crime. "The ICC provides for individual
criminal responsibility for crimes against humanity, including the
[crime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_of_apartheid) of
apartheid". With the absence of any law, proper conduct, you have
jungle law, and people, esp victims of that jungle will act in all
sorts of ways to change their existing situation. You will get animal
behaviour if you keep treating people like animals. To address that,
you need context.

"Decontextualization is bad but isn't national crime enforcement an example
of that? You do a crime you do the time?'"

What is the breakdown of total wealth in US? Top 10% hold about 100
trillion $.  All companies under SP 500 are worth 38 trillion, all
land, real estate is about 44 tr. Total gold is 14 tr, US probably has
1-2 trillon of that... Numbers are adding up. Combine all commodities,
cash (foreign, domestic), and bonds, you can reach 130-140 easy. Most
of that is held by the top 10%. Bottom 50% has nothing.
