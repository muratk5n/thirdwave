The Telegraph: "[The plan is] Milford Haven will be invented as a
powerhouse of hydrogen production, carbon capture and offshore wind
power as part of the shift to net zero. 'Right now, we’re sitting on
the horizon of a new epoch in the waterway’s history,' says.. chief
executive of the port of Milford Haven. 'It’s a really big opportunity
for us - and everyone here gets that'"

Bama wasn't a bad president.. But he wasn't a good one either. Just a
boring average like many others before him. This spoon feeding must
end.

The US gov need for integration is real. It is part of their
legitimacy offering. Remember how waspy wasp Judge Robers bent over
backwards to make ACA work.

Whenever something doesn't make sense on a per-case basis, look for
deeper psychological drives... BEV tech makes no sense, the reason for
its FOMO is spoon feeding per below. Shoddy businessman, even worse
techy half-brained cunt [e-jagoff](mbl/2022/ejagofftrump.jpeg) always
manages to stay around because he was blessed by the First Black President™,
in person. Assange was put through hell, more than any human being deserves,
because he made the First Black President™ and his admin look bad.

Pushing for battery-electric cars is a fool's errand - there isn't
enough lithium in the world to shift even a quarter of all cars to
BEV.

This tech has been limping forward only due to Dems' efforts to spoon
feed Obama his legacy. He'd pushed for this tech and the "First Black
President™" muuust haaaave a leeeeegacy, so Dems after him keep
promoting this shit.

@olimould It wasn't that literally nothing happened: a journalist

Remember when the Panama Papers came out? Remember that it evidenced a
global network of tax-dodging, wealth-hoarding, criminal activity by
the super-rich? Remember how literally nothing happened?"

Most of it is chick music.. And spefically white chick music. Any
random song from Beyonce, Rhianna is catchier. Where's her Deja Vu,
Halo, or that mad dance tune they go like uh oh, uh oh uh oh, oh and
shaking booty? Sad.

The Voyager: "Taylor Swift is the most overrated singer of our
generation... A lot of her fans are obsessive and, let´s be completely
honest, some of her songs are problematic and honestly overall, pretty
mediocre"

Yahoo News: "Trump tells autoworkers EV push will 'kill' jobs"

ABC News Australia: "Townsville is emerging as Australia's new Army
capital with hundreds of soldiers to be relocated to north Queensland
over coming years, while Adelaide becomes the home of advanced
land-based, long-range strike capabilities"

Creating more businesses isn't the solution to our problems.. Too much
business creation *is* the problem.
