Sounds like rabid interventionism to me. What a jackass

bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe
to assure the survival and the success of liberty"

Apparently SB and its Signet allowed the hyper growth of FTX, without
it they would have remained much smaller. Crypto ppl talk big game
about upending the system but they needed a connection to the
backbone, to the existing system through a bank. They found a few
gullable ones, used them, esp SB with its fast Signet along with money
launderers, criminals. See \#MarcCohodes

Yahoo Finance: "A class-action lawsuit was filed against Signature
Bank in February, alleging the bank knew about – and facilitated – the
'now infamous FTX fraud.' Specifically, the suit accuses Signature
Bank of having knowledge of and permitting 'the commingling of [the
FTX exchange's] customer funds within its proprietary,
blockchain-based payments network, Signet'"

If a near-future version of Trek is done, I'd want an Android there
called "Meme" instead of "Data". This character would be a clownish,
overly creative twat, all he does, all day long is generating memes;
just spouts one meme after another. TNG's Data was smart with
human-like strong AI, strived to learn art.. Meme has art but is
extremely dumb just like the modern "AI" algorithms today, but tries
to become smart. Meme acquiring an iota of intelligence in each
episode will be his character arc. At the end of 10 seasons he'll be
able to read text, summarize it, and drive a car.
