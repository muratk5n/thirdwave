The Lever: "It Just Got More Expensive To Fight Corporate Abuse.. From
credit card terms of service to employment contracts, millions of
people are trapped in agreements that only allow them to challenge
corporate abuse through a private system of arbitration rather than in
a court of law. Now, the biggest player in that private system has
posted new fees that experts say could make it more difficult for
consumers and workers to hold corporations accountable.

On Jan. 15, the American Arbitration Association (AAA), the largest
private provider of arbitration services in the world, quietly
implemented new fees for individuals filing a mass arbitration case
seeking monetary damages or contract relief from a company"

They are not wrong for asking that, they call for being taxed along
with all others who are also wealthy. If you are doing it on your own,
it would be a drop in the bucket. A policy that applies across the
board can cause change.

"There are campaigners who lobby for being taxed, why aren't they
simply giving it away?"

"@infmin@neurodifferent.me

.. enclosed the commons, and locked the food up, introduced the
concept of property and property law, enforced it with police, prisons
and courts you invented with your own interests in mind, and made it
so the only option for the vast majority of people is to be exploited
by you at every stage of their lives for virtually all of their basic
living requirements. So actually, yes, yes you do owe [people] a
fucking living"

In an "all money is debt to FED" world it would seem hyperinflation is
unlikely... Because all money is debt, it has to be paid back,
eventually all debt is due. When paid back money disappears, it is
taken out of the circulation = less inflationary pressure (extra money
held by regular people increasing circulation causes inf). I believe
hyperinflation, as it is seen in Argentina, Zimbabwe, and similar
places is almost always an outside-the-system print-without-debt
phenomena. Somebody is using the printing press, through the backdoor.

'[T]racking on the web, it's just how it is. If we get rid of it so
many companies will die off.'

There were companies before tracking tech. There was advertising
before tracking tech.

Tracking tech is just how they can pay the least, to get the
most. It's not a right. It's not a given. It's not required.

How did it work before? You made good products and the stuff that was
most popular rose to the top.

Ban tracking tech. Hamstring predatory and scammy products that
survive on targeting"
