In regular business ppl compete, excesses can be handled at the
courts.. Guy stepping over your IP, sue. But drug cartels are by
definition outside the law; so conflicts are handled by the gun. They
fight over access to trade routes, over supply, for manpower..

Right across the border from Tijuana is San Diego; US has demand,
money, Mexico has product. Narcotics is an extremely [high-margin](0119/2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.html#drugs)
business, product is easy to produce, and not fragile like electronics,
once certain hurdles are overcome, u could even catapult it over the wall
from Tijuana to San Diego. So high demand check, ease of production check,
-physically speaking- easy to transport check.

Then the product is made illegal. How could this backdrop not lead to
rampant violence?

Media calls the new police chief in Tijuana "Mexico's Rambo"... They
like these catchy phrases.. But the general environment is not
favorable for the chief.

The scheme is also open for cheating; companies can take their carbon
from anywhere do some shady biz just like Volkswagen in 2009-2015. And
guess which company is pushing for e-fuels the most.

Reuters: "E-fuels are made using CO2 captured from the atmosphere and
hydrogen extracted with renewable electricity, and can be used in any
conventional combustion engine. While they do release CO2 from the
tailpipe, it's just releasing what was captured in creating them,
hence the claim to carbon neutrality.. Plus, carbon offsetting won't
do anything to reduce the pollution and health effects caused by
tailpipe emissions"

Seymour Hersh: "[W]hy did much of the secret planning and training for
the [Nord Stream sabotage] operation take place in Norway?  And why
were highly skilled seamen and technicians from the Norwegian Navy
involved? The simple answer is that the Norwegian Navy has a long and
murky history of cooperation with American intelligence"

NWY folk have a little chip on their shoulder don't they? Beaten down
by neighboring nations in the past, maybe this is how they 'stand out'
now, by being a jagoff. Plus, per the Nordstream sabotage (which
allegedly they took a major part in), they had an economic interests
in Russian gas flow to Europe being disrupted.

Good news.. Major win for the region and China. US deep state was
