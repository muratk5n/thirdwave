Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Clean fuel tech is a win for both new and existing energy
companies. Fossil companies can pivot to H2 and utilize their existing
know-how. Republicans have nothing to fear as oil, gas companies have
much to gain in this space. Trump started the H2@Scale program while
in office. Everyone from BP to Total are active in domain.

.. as it's bin day, the bin wagon rolls around, and its new, and it's
powered by #hydrogen! And it's got big green stickers all over it and
it's in the South Derbyshire District Council livery.

So it's mine. I've paid for it through my rates and #SDDC have made
the kind of decisions I would make if I was sitting there deciding.

It's been a \#Labour council since 2021. I'll be exercising my
privilege to keep it that way on 4 May.

Local \#council \#elections matter. Don't waste your \#vote"

I read the bill guts IRA. Not good.

Un didnt get what he wanted from Trump. DJT eanted him to disarm, and
likely reduce US involvement in the region. Un didnt like that.

ðŸ˜‚ The sister gets in there delivers some punches.. But if we are to
believe Pompeo acct, NK really does not like China and beligerent
displays of weaponary helps increase US involvement in the region. It
is as if Un works for US' interests ðŸ¤”
