Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

H2 Central: "While many carbon capture technologies target a 90-96%
capture rate, the 8RH2 oxy-combustion process will eliminate virtually
all direct CO2 emissions. Unlike standard hydrogen production, 8RH2
uses natural gas and pure oxygen and then utilizes the CO2 produced in
the combustion process as a heat transfer medium in a proprietary
reformer before sequestering the CO2. 8RH2‘s advanced process
eliminates the need for costly amine or cryogenic-based CO2 separation
processes that are normally required to capture CO2, as carbon
separation is inherent to the process itself"
