liberty"

Carscoop: "[S]ome manufacturers begin to reassess their initial
optimism on EVs... With the likes of Ford revising its expectations on
the F-150 Lightning, GM scaling back on EV pick-up plans, Genesis

as HiPhi putting a six-month stop on EV production, it seems the
slowdown in EV adoption has taken many executives off-guard"

Brilliantcrank: "Tumblr and WordPress user data have been sold to
train AI, and Automattic intends to do it again moving
forward. Content posted on both platforms between 2014 and 2023 was
shared without user's permission. Even worse, the data exchanged
included private and deleted posts, private answers, and “content from
premium partner blogs” for clients like Apple. Without more answers,
404 Media reports that it’s unknown if any of this impacts self-hosted
blogs that use Automattic plugins like JetPack which is all but
required to run a WordPress site these days"
