Trump: "We know collective action can be incredibly effective. In
July, UPS agreed to a deal with the Teamsters Union in which, on
average, the annual salary of full-time drivers will be raised to
$170,000, including healthcare and other benefits.

What the rich and the politicians they own have succeeded in doing
since the Reagan administration, is convincing white working-class
Americans that unions are the enemy of working people, and
trickle-down economics (essentially tax cuts for the very rich) will,
counterintuitively, lead to economic equality. These are lies"
