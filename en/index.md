Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

teleSUR: "Colombian President Gustavo Petro sent to Congress a labor
reform bill that will reduce working week hours from 48 to 42 and
increase wages for working on Sundays and holidays by 100 percent...
'Being the most unproductive country in the [OECD] and, at the same
time, having the longest working day in the world is useless,' Petro
said, urgent to promote job stability so that the country can
industrialize"

Multiculturalism is a nice word but it never works - in one generation
the migrant assimilates. Why bother with mumbling stupid shit shaking
lanterns with smoke coming out whatever. State psyop likes this biz
bcz it is in their interest to keep people seperate, disconnected -
it's a variation of divide-and-rule.

Every immigrant, minority brings some changes into the larger soc they
are in, in proportion to their population. 10% can effect 10%. But
subsequent generations get the whole thing, not just the 10%. "The
unblemished, unchanged migrant, minority" fallacy dictates minority
only learns its own minority culture not the whole. This is a foolish
fantasy. Do not raise your children this way, you will fail to effect
their culture anyway, and you can make them neurotic.

DroneDj: "DroneUp, the drone delivery company that Walmart is using,
says it plans to test new hydrogen fuel cell technology that has the
potential to increase a droneâ€™s flight time to two to five hours.

This fuel cell technology has been developed by South Koreaâ€™s Doosan
Mobility Innovation (DMI), which is also building one of the
first-ever open-source, hydrogen-fuel-cell powered motorcycles in
collaboration with [MIT]..

Compared to conventional lithium battery-powered drones, DMIâ€™s
hydrogen fuel cell technology yields 3-to-1 energy density
characteristics. So, with this tech, a small drone can fly anywhere
between two to five hours, depending on factors such as payload weight
and weather"

ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ The hipster column is always at the ready to show up
at anything 'happening', hot, and techy.

NYT: "Mr. Bankman-Fried was presiding over the first edition of the
Crypto Bahamas conference, a showcase for FTX and a vivid
demonstration of his growing celebrity and influence...  One
afternoon, Mr. Bankman-Fried led a panel with Tony Blair and Bill
Clinton"

The RU animosity thing was mostly overblown too IMO, during Mao and
Xiaoping. They were playing you.

Now they are sufficiently developed, they can build their own tech,
for the rest can trade with Germany, Europe, whomever. They don't need
you anymore.

"China was entusiastic to show friendship to US during 1979 attacking
Vietnam to get tech / investment. Why are they giving cold shoulder to
us America now?"
