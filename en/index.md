Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

Doesn't automatically mean the movie is bad (as in Woke). If the
script is written well, it can work out \#TheFlash

"Freedom of the Press Foundation will soon launch the “Daniel Ellsberg
Chair on Government Secrecy.” This full-time staff position will be
dedicated to what Ellsberg has spent a large portion of his life
highlighting the need for: massive reform of the secrecy
infrastructure in the United States. In the coming months, we’ll seek
funds to fully endow this chair position so that it can live in
perpetuity, and be free from changes in any fiscal or political
climate"

In the end, the vote is a referandum on the incumbent; voters
primarily vote on their well-being, pocketbook, and tend to reelect
the incumbent. The incumbency advantage should wear off as time goes
on but in tigger case IMO frequent "outside interventions" constantly
renewed the incumbency advantage for Tayyeap, the last one being in
2016 (likely attempted by fools partly egged on by gov itself but
anyway). Polls suggest the undecideds overwhelmingly went for the
incumbent in the eleventh hour, that suggest the incumbency advantage
persists.

Candidate-wise; the current Stanpoli mayor from the opposition could
fare a little better, but he made an ass of himself by associating
with elitist/neolib scum types near election prep, leaving himself
open to attacks - one came in the form of a court case that put his
candidacy in question.

TR opposition loses again but their PR work was better this time
around. Assuming the election was legit (some claim there is 2-3%
potential for gov to 'create' votes), they likely fell short on
immigration, and in the last stretch leaned on too heavily on
nationalism judging the third guy with 5% took that share because of
nat rhetoric. That was a mistake. Plus the anti-Russki narrative was
unnecessary, RU was already supportive of current gov, but the added
antagonism would not help, made opposition look like a undiplomatic
neophytes.

It looks like Putin provided direct aid in the form of natgas payments
for the election (residential natgas bill for entire month of May was
zero), and the grain deal renewal gave a PR win for the gov, announced
right after the first round.

Politico: "There is little to no accurate information about exactly
what chemicals are used in fracking, or how harmful they may be to
humans or the planet.. The heavy explosives used to create the holes
and fissures also create instability in the earth, leading to erosion
and even earthquakes, like the twelve 2011 earthquakes that rocked the
area around a fracking site in Youngstown, Ohio - a region that had
not ever experienced a quake since such activity was observed and
recorded, beginning in 1776"

The *real* Moby Dick story eh?

"The plot of *In the Heart of the Sea* is very reminiscent of *Moby
Dick*.. That said [the movie] is not officially inspired by or adapted
from Melville's *Moby Dick*. It is, however, adapted from another
book, Nathaniel Philbrick's *In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of
the Whaleship Essex*, originally published in 2000, which recounts the
true story of the Essex"

---

*In the Heart of the Sea* was a good movie. I hate to say it I found myself
rooting for the whale.
