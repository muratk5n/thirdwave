New Atlas: "Researchers have used a low-emissions method to harvest
hydrogen and graphene from waste plastics... 'When we first discovered
flash Joule heating and applied it to upcycle waste plastic into
graphene, we observed a lot of volatile gases being produced and
shooting out of the reactor,' [lead researcher at Rice U project] Wyss
said. “We wondered what they were, suspecting a mix of small
hydrocarbons and hydrogen, but lacked the instrumentation to study
their exact composition'.

After acquiring the equipment needed to analyze the vaporized contents
thanks to funding from the US Army Corps of Engineers, the researchers
found their suspicions were correct: the process produced hydrogen
gas"

PV Mag: "Fortescue Future Industries’ planned facility, officially
proposed at the Willow Cale Industrial Park in Prince George, should
produce roughly 140,000 tonnes of hydrogen and 700,000 tonnes of
ammonia per year, which would be used for both domestic use and
export. The USD 2 billion ($3.11b) ‘Project Coyote’ would need 1,000
MW of power from BC Hydro to create the green hydrogen by
electrolysis, which would then be processed into green ammonia"

The accord allowed Israel to hang on to pre-defined military zones, so
Israel just defined any random place it wanted as an MZ effectively
gutting the accord. OA had holes in it like swiss cheese.

Of course the Oslo Accords was flawed, it was a Clinton plan

Informed Comment: "30 Years after Arafat-Rabin Handshake, clear Flaws
in Oslo Accords doomed peace Talks to Failure... Thirty years later,
it is clear the Oslo Accords have achieved neither peace nor a
two-state solution. So far in 2023 alone, over 200 Palestinians and
nearly 30 Israelis have been killed. Israel has the most right-wing,
nationalist government in its history..

[T]he Oslo peace process failed because the framework itself was
deeply flawed in three key ways. First, it ignored the power imbalance
between the two sides. Second, it focused on ending violence by
Palestinian militant groups while overlooking acts of violence
committed by the Israeli state. And third, it sought peace as the end
goal, rather than justice.

Pretending metals such as lithium are going to sustain our indulgent
Global North lifestyles is a sham. Batteries depend on mining copper,
nickel, cobalt and rare minerals as well, in lands where we exploit
human beings. Metals and minerals will never adequately replace the
bubble that was fossil fuels, anyhow, and mining will beget yet more
environmental harm... Those who say there are endless metals and
minerals wish to mine our dying oceans as well, for profit, not
humanity. It’s a sham, so billionaires can become
trillionaires. Mining causes enormous ecological destruction.. drains
and pollutes precious groundwater even as historic drought
increases. One metric ton of lithium requires 500,000 gallons of water
to process"

It is likely the latter. If we had to guess the disagreement likely
had to do with Taiwan, Zee Ping Ping wants to "do" it, some in the top
brass and the party are resisting. Taiwan would be a tough nut to
crack so I'm not surprised.

That is the TRUTH

"@realDonaldTrump@truthsocial.com

The all Electric Car is a disaster for both the United Auto Workers
and the American Consumer. They will all be built in China and, they
are too expensive, don’t go far enough, take too long to charge, and
pose various dangers under certain atmospheric conditions. If this
happens, the United Auto workers will be wiped out, along with all
other auto workers in the United States. The all Electric Car policy
is about as dumb as Open Borders"
