Politico: "A now-former U.S. official [Josh Paul] explains why he
resigned rather than pave the way for more arms transfers to Israel as
it battles Hamas...

'I know this is an unpopular opinion and too soon, but maybe the best
thing for Israel right now is not security assistance in the sort of
volume that makes them think they can afford to just ignore the
Palestinian question and hope that, cordoned off, it will go away. Or
to put it another way, if we weren’t giving them billions a year for
decades, is it more or less likely they would have found it in their
interest for the Oslo process to work and we wouldn’t be where we are
today...

[W]e always talk about Israel has a right to defend itself. And let’s
provide Israel with the Iron Dome, which by the way, I entirely
support. They should not have to live under rocket fire.

But we never turned it around and think about the threat to
Palestinians from Israeli incursions into their villages in the West
Bank on a constant basis, from bombardment from Israel against homes
in Gaza, or housing demolitions in the West Bank. We always approach
this problem from one perspective, and I think that’s part of the
problem.. we’ve seen for over 20 years that the commitment we made to
Israel of security for peace, essentially, has not led to security or
peace and in fact, leads to insecurity and makes peace further away...

[P]eople don’t grasp the day-to-day realities, and tend to only see
one side of the conflict, because that’s the side that’s easy to
access, that is media savvy, that is in many ways more relatable from
an American perspective'"

New Lines Magazine: "As the Middle East Reels, a New Option Takes
Shape: Expulsion.. The idea, which has gone through multiple
iterations over the decades since Israel’s founding, by turns illegal,
unworkable or extreme, posits the wholesale population transfer of
Gazans into the Sinai... Despite the long-standing prima facie
rejection by the Arab world of the idea of expulsion, this solution
is, apparently, increasingly seen as more feasible than asking Israel
to conduct its upcoming war on the strip with a judicious amount of
violence or to figure out a way to actually coexist with the
Palestinians. It has been floated by European and Israeli officials
without irony, which likely prompted Sisi’s response as well as
off-the-record comments by Egyptian and Arab officials to the media
pointing out the double standard of feigning concern for the human
rights of Palestinians while orchestrating a plan to deport them en
masse under pain of death..

During Israel’s creation in 1948, Zionist militia groups and the
Israeli army that grew out of them followed a blueprint called.. Plan
D [which] identified specific Palestinian cities and towns to be
targeted and provided instructions for how to expel their
inhabitants. An internal Israeli military intelligence document
reveals that at least 75% of the Palestinians who fled did so as a
result of 'military actions by Zionist militias, psychological
campaigns aimed at frightening Arabs into leaving, and dozens of
direct expulsions,' scholars Joel Beinin and Lisa Hajjar note.

Indeed, even shortly after 1948, a plan to resettle Palestinians in
the Sinai was tried... [I]n the early 1950s, the United Nations
hatched a plan to resettle tens of thousands of Palestinians in the
Sinai, thereby eliminating the Palestinian right of return. It
ultimately failed because, as Adler writes, 'The 1955 uprising in Gaza
— what would become known as the March Intifada — forced
U.N. officials to abandon refugee resettlement projects and recognize
Palestinian claims to a political identity of their own.'"

Zakaria: "Professor Dimitri Shumsky of Hebrew University writes [in
Haaretz.. ] provocatively that for years Netanyahu developed and
advanced a destructive, warped political doctrine that held that
strengthening Hamas at the expense of the Palestinian Authority would
be good for Israel. This approach divided the Palestinians, undermined
the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and made it easy for
Netanyahu to claim there was no path to a Palestinian state.  Shumsky
cites a Jerusalem Post report that at a Likud Party meeting in 2019,
Netanyahu made clear that he supported the money that the Qatari
government was sending to Hamas. That way, Bibi is reported to have
said 'Israel would foil the establishment of a Palestinian state'. Tal
Schneider references the same meeting, and also notes that most of the
time Israel policy was to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden
and Hamas as an asset"
