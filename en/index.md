See how the wealth of the top %10 jumped in that time period. This is
massive amounts of munee looking for a place to invest in. A lot of
cash went to mortgage lending.

```python
df = u.get_fred(2001,['WFRBLT01026', 'WFRBLN09053','WFRBLN40080','WFRBLB50107'])
df['Top 10%'] = (df['WFRBLT01026'] + df['WFRBLN09053']) * 100 / df.sum(axis=1)
df = df[df.index < "2008-01-01"]
df[['Top 10%']].plot(title="Top 10% Wealth")
```

Richard Vague, *A Brief History of Doom*: "The 2008 economic crisis in
the United States was the direct result of the runaway growth in
private debt from 2001 to 2007, especially growth in
mortgages. Mortgages doubled from $5.3 trillion to an astonishing 10.6
trillion in a mere six years"

with Hexagon Purus, a manufacturer of zero-emission mobility and
infrastructure systems, for Type 4 hydrogen fuel storage systems in
California. The systems will be produced in Hexagon Purus’ facility in
Kassel, Germany"

OSI: "The United Nations Open Source United community and the Open
Source Initiative (OSI) today announced that the OSI has become the
first organization to officially endorse the UN Open Source
Principles. The UN Open Source Principles, recently adopted by the UN
Chief Executive Board’s Digital Technology Network (DTN), provide
guidelines to drive collaboration and Open Source adoption within the
UN and globally"

Hey if you are a real-life sniper taking out women and children for
the Zionist cause they'll give you a star before you are 40. Hell they
should give Netanyahoo a star for that accomplishment. He's been at it
for decades now.

Hindustan Times: "TikToker Kevin Smith called it 'one of the funniest
things' in his video about the same. It has got more than 500
comments... [he commented on Gadot's star] 'May I ask the age old
question, "for what"?  What did she do to earn this? Was it her
scintillating role in Red Notice? Or performance of a lifetime in
Netflix's Heart of Stone?'"

GG got a star on the Holywood Walk of Fame? Really?

Stew first dry later, could be a better method even on modern
equipment.

Sun drying works very well.. In fact it was recently [discovered](https://news.mit.edu/2024/how-light-can-vaporize-water-without-heat-0423)
it is not about the heat but the light rays' direct effect that causes
much of the evaporation / drying.

Watching a docu about Hungarian goulash. They would stew the meat down
in a large kettle until there was no liquid left, eat some, dry the
rest in the sun, like native Americans did with pemmican from bison
meat, then if you need meal add dry meat some water and vegs in a
cauldron cook, and have a brand new soup. The claim is this is why
goulash spread first in Hungary and later in Europe.

"Privatisation of water isn’t failing - it is the failure. The
Government is mid-way through a major review of the water
sector.. Instead of protecting private profits, we should prioritise
clean, affordable, and democratically-controlled water for all. That's
why Clive Lewis MP and Compass are calling on the Government to put
public ownership back on the table"

Rabbi Schnozzy's schnozz is in everything... He might be getting oppo
intel from Israel to use domestically within the United States. A
shady character for sure. 

---

Cory Booker had relations with that f-ing guy too, Rabbi Schnozzy, but
they had a falling out. CB happily voted for more bombs for Israel
later though, so he is still serving the corporate complex in many
ways. A mixed bag.
