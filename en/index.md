TechXplore: "'Nearly sustainable' hydrogen could cut ammonia
production emissions by 95%.. In a study looking at the European
ammonia industry, researchers from the Hong Kong University of Science
and Technology (HKUST) and ETH Zurich have now calculated the
conditions under which it would be worthwhile to switch ammonia
production to green or almost green hydrogen. The research is
published in Nature Communications.

Two results stand out. First, in some European countries such as
Norway, Spain, Hungary or Poland, ammonia production from green or
almost green hydrogen would already make economic sense today. In
these countries, generating sustainable electricity from solar or wind
energy is particularly cost-effective"

De Schutter, *The Guardian*: "Obsession with growth is enriching
elites and killing the planet... In the past four years alone the
world’s five richest men have more than doubled their fortunes, while
nearly 5 billion people have been made poorer. If current trends
continue, 575 million people will still be trapped in extreme poverty
in 2030 – the deadline set by the world’s governments to eradicate
it. Currently, more than 4 billion people have no access whatsoever to
social protection"

is likely to suggest to [put glue on your pizza](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-glue-pizza-i-tried-it-2024-5),
and not provide any sane solutions.
