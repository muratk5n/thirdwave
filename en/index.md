Never forget that when Seoul, Korea removed the Cheonggyecheon
expressway in 2003 and replaced it with a restored stream, 1000 acre
park and improved transit, not only did it transform the cityâ€™s public
life & economic success, but the traffic got better.

The traffic got BETTER"

Now that I think about it, most of my DIY tools are read-heavy,
lookups, mapping so forth requiring minimal data in the background,
retrievable in a single JSON file pull. Javascript can handle that on
its sleep. Settings stored in a cookie => no complex server infra
needed. That gives me ideas.. ðŸ¤”

Apparently the firing had to do with "conflict of interest" issues
during privatization days in Russia in the 90s. These Clinton people
are up to their neck with Russia Russia Russia, while oligarchs were
destroying the country some might have benefited via kickbacks. I'm
sure that's why they took up to Russiagate so eagerly, it was the
ultimate misdirection, and a great excuse to cover up an embarrasing
loss to a former game show host.

Politico: "Lawrence Summers.. criticize[s] Harvard for student statement
blaming Israel"

Arab News: Israel is 'entirely responsible for all unfolding
violence,' and the attacks by Hamas 'did not happen in a vacuum,' 31
Harvard student organizations have said. Releasing a 'Joint Statement
by Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups on the Situation in Palestine,'
the organizations said Israel had forced Palestinians to live in an
'open-air prison for over two decades.' The statement added: 'The
apartheid regime is the only one to blame. Israeli violence has
structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 years'"

Academic/Activist Randa Abdel-Fattah: "Palestinians have tried every
single avenue [to resist non-violently]. BDS is a peaceful movement
that was called by the civil society. It is criminalized in the US. I
just got back from there, and we would had panel discussions, they
tried to shut us down. We protest, 8000 people in the Great March of
Return [in Gaza], protested peacefully, we were shot at with live
ammunition. We go to social media, and advocate there, we get shut
out, silenced on social media. Every single avenue - international law
for instance, US will veto and shut that route down. All these
peaceful avenues are pursued by Palestinians and that is never good
enough. No form of resistance is good enough, it is only acceptable if
you are a dead Palestinian"
