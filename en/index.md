J. Geuter: "I have argued for a while that I see the current LLM craze
as a bit of a weird path of innovation. Neural networks can do certain
things very well. Like for example reducing heterogenous input data
from the real world down to a limited model suitable for algorithms to
work on. They can be an interface level to glue software/hardware to
the chaos that is physics and people. But a lot of the actual things
we want to do need to be deterministic, testable, verifiable,
auditable. So the future of that space lies probably more in smaller,
focused models that give certain guarantees with regards to fault
tolerance and quality that then will be used as building blocks to
build often very traditional software on. That will enable us to use
these statistical systems for the things they can do while allowing us
to build proper systems for the things they cannot"

Vlogger lady says this is how they preserved meat during World War II
wout refigration. Wow.

Cooking food in a jar, once done, keep it closed, it is preserved as
is.  Bacteria in the jar died while cooking, and as long as container
kept is closed, new ones will not enter, plus the meal is now
precooked.

The late Shah's son is on, talking about how opressive the current
Iranian regime is... His father was surely toppled but the Shah
himself came into power via a British and US plot who did not want the
nationalization of Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (todays's BP) by
left-wing *democratically elected* prime minister Mosaddeq. Now he is
whining boo hoo, boo hooo, current regime is so opressive, me
sad. Well your f-ing father was worse. Stop whining.

When gov does not interject, and "people buy what they want (a want
that can be guided, through marketing, addictive compounds)", junk
food will rule the day. That's why you have a fat ass brother.

Singapore gov subsidizes healthy food, taxes junk food too doesn't it?
It's a good idea.

seem to be working.. The case for a junk food tax in America"

Hickel: "When essential goods are privatized and expensive, people
need more income than they would otherwise require to access them. To
get it they are compelled to increase their labour in capitalist
markets, working to produce new things that may not be needed (with
increased energy use, resource use, and ecological pressure) simply to
access things that clearly are needed, and which are quite often
already there.

Take housing, for example. If your rent goes up, you suddenly have to
work more just to keep the same roof over your head.Â  At an
economy-wide level, this dynamic means we need more aggregate
production â€” more growth â€” in order to meet basic needs. Â From the
perspective of capital, this ensures a steady flow of labour for
private firms, and maintains downward pressure on wages to facilitate
capital accumulation. For the rest of us it means needless
exploitation, insecurity, and ecological damage"

If you ask me, I'd say what we most urgently need to do is *less*.

Less of almost everything.

Less work, less consumerism, less travel, less buying, less waste,
less stress, less pollution.

'Slowing down is the Revolution.'

It wouldn't be a solution for everything but it would be a good start"

Clustering is unsupervised, learning with labels (what most neural net
"AI" does these days) is supervised. NNs are not very good at the
former. Nothing to parrot on

There are many clustering algorithms

How to write a "[app] serverless recommender" (movies, songs).
Tranmismitting the whole ratings database to the browser would be
slow. But you could cluster all users' movie ratings beforehand, and
send the browser only the cluster centers. User code then finds its
similarity to a cluster (10-20 of them) which should run fast, and
starts asking for the users in that cluster piece-by-piece, in small
chunks, uses their top ratings for its recommendations.

There you go - no complicated server structure, "cloud", only static
files. Good stuff eh?

German rocketry was crucial for US landing a man on the moon and let's
not forget, the Soviets were to first to send the first man in space.
The Soviets were also the first to land spacecraft on the Moon, Venus,
and Mars. By way of inventor origin, the world's two most popular
computer languages hail from Denmark and Netherlands, the world's most
commonly used operating system's creator is from Finland. There has
been much sci/tech activity thanks to fureigners.

CNBC: "Multnomah County in Oregon is suing oil and gas companies Exxon
Mobil, Shell, Chevron, BP, ConocoPhillips and related organizations
for the damages caused by the 2021 Pacific Northwest heat dome... The
heat caused 69 people to die, property damage and was a draw on
taxpayer resources, Multnomah County says."

Good to see that California is looking at passing a bill to allow
striking workers to receive unemployment.  This will help ensure that
management comes to the table to negotiate in good faith instead of
hoping to force the union to take a worse deal because they are
starving"
