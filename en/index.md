"Rolls-Royce collaborates with technology partners on highly efficient
hydrogen engine for stationary power generation.. Rolls-Royce has
started, with a consortium of five companies and research institutes,
to develop the necessary technologies for a highly efficient
first-of-a-kind hydrogen combustion engine to drive combined heat and
power (CHP) systems... 

[F]unded by the German Government, the consortium aims to generate the
same electrical and thermal energy (power density and efficiency) as
currently available through natural gas CHP units in the higher power
range of up to 2.5 MW. When fuelled by green hydrogen, this next
generation stationary energy plant will be able to run in a completely
carbon neutral manner"

WRMEA: "[2022/11] AIPAC Election Role Raises Question of Foreign Agent
Registration.. For the first time, the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC) formed two [PACs] which have set records in their
contributions to candidates in primary election campaigns this year...

AIPAC also launched a super PAC [UDP]..  which initially did not
include any mention of Israel in its 'About Us' statement. As a super
PAC, UDP can accept unlimited donations, but it must disclose its
donors. It cannot fund candidates directly, but it can spend unlimited
amounts advocating for or against candidates. UDP was the biggest
spending political action committee during the primaries and dispensed
more than $24.2 million in support of its favored candidates. Out of
eight candidates backed by UDP, six won their primaries..

Going back to the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration repeatedly
insisted that the American Zionist Council (AZC) register as 'agents
of a foreign government'..

[In his book Grant F. Smith] writes: 'Not until the early 1960s would
the Senate begin to investigate whether U.S. aid sent overseas and
other funds were being secretly laundered back into the U.S. to obtain
political influence and additional foreign aid. In 1963, a close
analysis of [AZC official] I. L. Kenen’s financing revealed that this
was indeed happening'..  The Senate hearings documented the fact that
in the early 1960s, Israel funneled $5 million (more than 35 million
in today’s dollars) into U.S. propaganda and lobbying operations"
