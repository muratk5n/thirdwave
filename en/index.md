Because we were looking for more things to do when these clowns
decided to write 'the letter,' [about so-called 'AI pause'] and cite
our \#StochasticParrots paper while saying the opposite of what we
write, we.. [wrote](https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023)
a statement in response.. It is dangerous to distract ourselves with a fantasized
AI-enabled utopia or apocalypse which promises either a 'flourishing' or
'potentially catastrophic' future. Such language that inflates the capabilities
of automated systems and anthropomorphizes them, as we note in [Stochastic Parrots](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3442188.3445922), 
deceives people into thinking that there is a sentient being behind the
synthetic media. This not only lures people into uncritically trusting
the outputs of systems like ChatGPT, but also misattributes agency"

If you can be China, be China. Don't try to be China and Italy at the
same time.

Same problem different country. Either unelected bureucrats run the
country, or elected politicians do. Make up your mind. Can't have
both.

CNBC: "Thailand’s Move Forward party swept up a majority of votes in a
historic election but the official result will only be delivered a
month from now... If the Move Forward party officially wins, its
controversial policies could threaten the military and the monarchy.
Ruling elites could ban Move Forward, just like its predecessor Future
Forward, but that raises the risk of more street protests"

Military talks too much. Stop meddling in politics. Go back to your
barracks. Get a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up.

The Japan Times: "Uncertainty in Pakistan as military faces
unprecedented challenge to authority.. Khan’s arrest on corruption
charges earlier this month, which he says was at the behest of the
generals, led to violent nationwide protests, including attacks on
military buildings and on the homes of senior officers"

Not sure of his mgmt chops but a pro-progressive statement is made
through the pick. The corporatist wing of Dems never liked Kucinich.

No wonder his Fox News had problems with Tucker, he was consorting
with the enemy, giving voice to too many leftists.

Murdoch.. This guy was there when it all started. A neolib legend.

Wiki: "The Wapping dispute was a lengthy failed strike by print
workers in London in 1986. Print unions tried to block distribution of
*The Sunday Times*, along with other newspapers in Rupert Murdoch's
News International group, after production was shifted to a new plant
in Wapping in January 1986... All of the workers were dismissed. The
failure of the strike was devastating for the print union workers, and
it led both to a general decline in trade union influence in the
UK... Along with the miners' strike of 1984–85, the Wapping dispute
was a significant defeat in the history of the British trade union
movement"
