Most of the time, no it doesn't make sense for businesses to run like
a government.

Part of government services is that in order to actually cover 100% of
people, it's going to require massively overbuilding the
infrastructure to ensure that there's enough resources to handle even
the edge cases - despite the fact that those edge cases oftentimes
aren't 'profitable' to serve.

Take, for example, USPS vs FedEx. The remit of USPS is to deliver mail
to EVERY SINGLE ADDRESS IN THE COUNTRY. Yes, even the ones that
require taking a sea plane 500 miles into rural Alaska to serve a
village of a dozen customers. FedEx, on the other hand, will only
serve the addresses that it finds profitable to do so.

When conservatives want to 'government like a business', part of
what they're saying is that they simply want to not serve the parts of
the population that aren't "profitable". But profit should never be
the point of government services. It's defining what services are
worth providing to every single citizen, and ensuring that they're
delivered to them - yes, even the ones that are far more difficult to
provide"

ProPublica: "Over the last four decades, states have enacted hundreds
of laws dictating precisely what insurers must cover so that consumers
aren’t driven into debt or forced to go without medicines or
procedures. But health plans have violated these mandates at least
dozens of times in the last five years, ProPublica found"

EU IR Rep Borell: "There is no hierarchy between horrors. One horror
does not justify another horror. And the pain that you inflict on
children of others, will not justify never, will not compensate the
pain your children have been suffering. On the contrary, it will
create a violent spiral that will come once again unless we got a
peace, a sustainable peace.

That is why the European Union has called for immediate humanitarian
pauses, and the United Nations Security Council.. adopted a very
important resolution asking for immediate, urgent and sustained
humanitarian pauses..

I want to remind that the decisions of UN Security Council are not
just words. They are compulsory, they have to be implemented.

But this resolution has not been implemented, not yet. To the
contrary, the bombing has continued. I have to recall that this
decision of the UN Security Council has to be implemented. Too many
lives are being lost every day"
