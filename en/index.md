The wait is finally over. From 2024, USB-C will be the common standard
for electronic devices in the EU â€“ and we have already seen the
impact!

It means 

ðŸ”ŒThe same charger for all phones, tablets and cameras 

âš¡ Harmonised fast-charging technology 

ðŸ”„Reduced e-waste 
 
One charger to rule them all. 

Now, a reality"

"The Web is Fantastic.. The real web is built on links. Hyper ones, in
fact. Links you can share on your website. Links you can send to your
mates. Links to pages that can be indexed by search engines so you can
find things again..

The big social media sites have decided that actually no, we don't
like links. Just sort of "find" things and if you don't find it well
tough shit. Sharing interesting websites, blogs, and articles on your
own site is the way to go. Make a blogroll. Make a podroll. Share
links on your Mastodon account...

Blogs and RSS never died. Some of us just took a little break from it
while we all shitposted on Twitter for likes, retweets, and
validation. While we wrote long, unfindable threads instead of blog
posts. I'm as guilty of this as anyone"

NYT: "[C]ritics both within Israel and outside have questioned whether
resolving to destroy such a deeply entrenched organization [as Hamas]
was ever realistic. One former Israeli national security adviser
called the plan 'vague'. 'I think that we have reached a moment when
the Israeli authorities will have to define more clearly what their
final objective is,' President Emmanuel Macron of France said this
month. 'The total destruction of Hamas? Does anybody think thatâ€™s
possible? If itâ€™s that, the war will last 10 years.' Since it first
emerged in 1987, Hamas has survived repeated attempts to eliminate its
leadership. The organizationâ€™s very structure was designed to absorb
such contingencies, according to political and military
specialists. In addition, Israelâ€™s devastating tactics in the Gaza war
threaten to radicalize a broader segment of the population, inspiring
new recruits"

Andersen: "As antitrust enforcement was discredited and enfeebled
starting in the 1970s, big corporations were able to get so big and
dominant in their business or regions that they had ever fewer
companies directly competing with them to hire workers. More and more
of them became the only games in town. One of the scholars who has
helped expose this particular bit of rigging and its unfairness over
the last several decades is the influential, idiosyncratic University
of Chicago law professor Eric Posner. As he and his economist
co-author Glen Weyl explain, antitrust laws were enacted to make sure
that businesses compete in every wayâ€”not just as sellers setting the
prices they charge for products and services, but also as buyers of
labor setting the salaries they pay.

The appeal of antitrust for citizens was to make sure competition kept
prices lower and salaries higher. Enforcement of our antitrust laws,
however, has come to focus entirely on consumer prices, particularly
since the definitive Borking of the field in the late 1970s. The
antitrust enforcers at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade
Commission, because they rely 'on the traditional assumption that
labor markets are competitive,' and that it wasnâ€™t their jobs to
protect workers anyhow, 'have never blocked a merger because of its
effect on labor,' and they donâ€™t even employ experts who could
calculate those effects"

TDB: "I Served in the IDF in the 2014 War in Gaza. The Friends I Lost
There Should Have Been the Last Ones. Almost every old friend I run
into talks to me about Gaza. Most of them are in therapy to help them
let go of what they experienced thereâ€”most of them unsuccessfully. We
are the soldiers who served the Israeli concept of 'managing the
conflict' and the endless rounds-of-fighting policy"
