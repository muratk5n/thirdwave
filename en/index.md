Hawaiian natives did not all of a sudden materialize in that place, or
"evolve" as Hawaiian FYI. The first inhabitants arrived there from
somewhere else, quite recently in fact compare to our total
history. The route seems to be Africa, Arabian Peninsula, India,
China, Papua New Guinea, Somoa, Hawaii. Some from that branch went to
Madagascar, so Hawaiian-like people could perhaps be found there.

HS Today: "The new H2Rescue Emergency Relief Truck (H2Rescue), which
started as an ambitious idea years ago, is now a full prototype
demonstrating the feasibility and value of this concept.

'I don’t think people fully appreciate what it means to not have
power, you don’t realize how critical it is for communities until you
don’t have it,' said S&T Under Secretary Dr. Dimitri Kusnezov, who saw
the vehicle up close at a demonstration at the U.S. Department of
Energy headquarters in June.

H2Rescue is a zero-emission, hydrogen powered truck that can carry a
total load of about 33,000 pounds (truck and cargo) into disaster
zone. It is equipped with a mobile command center and the capability
to generate enough power to run about 15 homes for three days,
accomplished with only water vapor coming out of the tailpipe. Where
traditional diesel trucks use their limited carrying capacity to
transport generators that emit exhaust into the environment, H2Rescue
is the generator—emitting nothing but steam"

In the light of this findings the extraterrestrial Oumuamua claim
becomes less likely. Had already downgraded the extraterrestrial UFO
views, noone can produce anything other than grainy videos, plus most
of the proponents of said theories are cultural leftist, or right-wing
anti-government fucknuts who like to associate all kinds of
bizarreness with the government so they can "limit it" when they are
in power.

---

It turns out the theory where Oumuamua was emitting gas, propelling it
forward still has legs.. People were wondering how OM could speed that
fast, the H2 iceberg (melting causing the gas formation) claim was
debunked but there is newer, more plausible one.
