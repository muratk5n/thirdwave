Anne Hidalgo: 'Cars Will Not Return To the Eiffel Tower' after the
Olympic Games.

'The Trocadéro will be greened and the Pont d'Iéna pedestrianized, up
to the Champ de Mars, which will be reforested. The whole thing will
form a large park in the heart of Paris'"

Motorious: "BMW Shifts Focus to Hydrogen Power.. In a significant
shift within the automotive industry, BMW is reportedly pivoting away
from electric vehicles (EVs), turning its attention to hydrogen fuel
cell technology as a groundbreaking alternative for sustainable
transportation. Amid the burgeoning popularity of EVs,
hydrogen-powered vehicles, which have largely been in the background,
are now emerging as a significant contender in the eco-friendly
vehicle market"

Axios: "The outlook for hydrogen-powered vehicles is
improving.. thanks to unprecedented federal support.. General Motors
and Honda have started producing fuel cells at a factory near Detroit,
to power a new plug-in hybrid fuel cell version of Honda's CR-V
crossover utility coming this spring.

- They'll also go into a line of hydrogen-powered cement mixers, dump
  trucks, garbage trucks and more that GM is developing with Autocar
  Industries, a heavy truck manufacturer.

- And GM has a new joint venture with Komatsu to develop fuel
  cell-powered mining trucks"

Even Republicans in US weren't shy of using non-free-market solutions
before this neoliberalism, see Nixon in 1971. Wage/Price control
doesn't have to be permanent, do it for a short time, break the cycle
in terms of psychology, then go back to business as usual.

How to kill hyperinflation? For a short-period of time, institute
price controls on the supply-side, wage freezes on the demand side. Do
this for a year, and watch inflation fall like a rock. Inflation has
to do with excessive money circulation among the regular people, money
chasing regular everyday items, a freeze on both supply and demand on
those items will fix the issue.

Half-assed intervention, raising wages to match inflation will make
inflation worse

McManus, Current Affairs: "It really is the case that home ownership
is becoming unattainable for everyone without a trust fund, our planet
is facing a serious environmental crisis, and economic elites do in
fact wield tremendously outsized influence relative to ordinary
citizens. Uber-rich bros like real estate CEO and multi-millionaire
Tim Gurner may try to blame this discontent on too much avocado toast
or 'arrogant' workers, but many of us right now have adopted an 'it’s
not me, it’s you' attitude towards what we call neoliberal
capitalism—a state of arrangements in which profit is prioritized
above human needs, personal grit and developing 'a brand called you'
are deemed more important than social welfare policies, and the state
and the private sector work hand in hand to enrich corporations and
billionaires at the expense of the rest of us"
