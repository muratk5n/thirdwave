Researchers of the [RU] Institute of Hydrogen Energy of the Ural
Federal University..  have created a promising material for hydrogen
energy devices. The new material has high proton conductivity and
unusual properties (depending on the degree of doping). It can be used
as an electrolyte (at high doping levels) and as an electrode (at low
doping levels) in solid oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers..

This allows these materials to be used as electrodes for the same
electrochemical devices, both solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and
electrolyzers. This opens up wide possibilities for applications in
electrochemical converters, in particular for oxygen-, hydrogen- and
water-permeable membranes," explains Georgy Starostin, co-author and
Research Engineer at the Hydrogen Energy Laboratory of UrFU.

Prospect: "[I]t’s a uniquely American feature of political and
financial crises that the characters our systems hold accountable for
their bottomless supply of elaborate malfeasance seem always to lean
toward the implausibly clownish. A conspicuously impaired 22-year-old
named Lynndie England bore responsibility for a sprawling assembly
line of physical and psychological torture at Abu Ghraib while her
higher-ups skated; a 30-year-old Goldman Sachs trader nicknamed
“Fabulous Fab” was the most senior bulge bracket bank executive
indicted in the multitrillion subprime CDO racket while his hedge fund
clients walked away billionaires.

So it goes with the gargantuan phalanx of flimflammers and rug-pullers
who sold America’s debt-enslaved youth on the fever dream of the
blockchain. Yes, SBF is behind bars, but.. billionaires who
shamelessly shilled for so many other interconnected
cash-for-counterfeit schemes just orchestrated a $42 billion bank run
and were instantly rewarded with an unprecedented bailout"

"Ben" has interesting some observations on crypto land.. 

Prospect: "Signature Bank had reinvented itself as one of the
crypto-friendliest banks in America, possibly to offset an unusual
slump in its previous client base, the New York City landlord
class. But while the big bet had shrunk its stock price, Signature
seemed to have weathered Crypto Winter all right until a hysterical
billionaire bank run took out Silicon Valley Bank on March 10.
Following a relentless weekend lobbying campaign led by Twitter’s most
insufferable rich guys, bank regulators announced they would be
invoking—with noxious irony, given that SVB had just five years
earlier successfully won its emancipation from a litany of bank
regulations on the premise that it was not systemically important—the
'systemic risk' exception to guarantee Silicon Valley’s uninsured
depositors"

This word became prevalent with the US deep state project ISIS ("The
Islamic Caliphate"), which tells you what the shadowy figures in the
dark corners of US policy want to happen in the Islamic world.  They
would like to have a Caliphate which they could influence, the label
could be used as a wrecking ball, hit one goverment or the other when
they disagree, manufacture managed chaos which then could further be
utilized as a pretext for operations "to bring democracy" there.

---

An official Caliph no longer exists; the title was abolished when the
last Ottoman mucker holding it was stripped of it, and later the royal
family fled from Stanpoli to UK en masse anyway (to UK, interesting
isn't it?). Saudia Arabia is not a caliphate, they are the keepers of
the holy sites, but SA ruler is not a caliph. Neither is the Egyptian
head of gov, or UAE, or even Jordan (where the current king is a
descendant of Mohammad).

American complains "women cannot go to school in Afghanistan". You
lost your chance to improve that country when u failed to switch AFG
agro from [ophium to cotton](2023/01/little-america-chandrasekaran.html).
Livelihood trumps school. Improvement in livelihood could pave the way
for more changes. Now you are gone, and oppo kicked your ass on the way out.
Why constantly whine about it?

That whole "Taiwan is so close to China" observation (suggesting they
can invade easily) was probably to argue that he didn't want to defend
Taiwan, strategically speaking. Factually, US *could* help defend
China even with the proximity problem.

---

Trump changed some aspects of CH rel but he wasn't too anti-China.
There are Reps 10 times more hawkish.
