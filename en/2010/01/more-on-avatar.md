# More On Avatar

From Murat Iyigun quoting David Brooks

"[The movie] rests on the assumption that nonwhites need the White Messiah to lead their crusades. It rests on the assumption that illiteracy is the path to grace. It also creates a sort of two-edged cultural imperialism. Natives can either have their history shaped by cruel imperialists or benevolent ones, but either way, they are going to be supporting actors in our journey to self-admiration. It’s just escapism, obviously, but benevolent romanticism can be just as condescending as the malevolent kind — even when you surround it with pop-up ferns and floating mountains."

What the f..k are you talking about

Science gets a good support in this movie, the scientist are usually portrayed as evil master planners who concoct some kind of weapon for world domination (or work someone who has such plans) but in this movie, they are the good guys. Illiteracy for path to grace? C'mon.

White messiah comment makes no sense either: The movie canon specifically mentions some other dude from the past who has ridden that large beasty dragon lookin' flying shabang, and that dude was no outsider. Our white guy is only following his footsteps (according to the movie).

Listen: Avatar is Dances with Wolves with better CGI, minus Kevin Costner. Nice huh? :)

That's it!
