# Single Currency?

In an age where breaking up of the euro is seriously discussed, noone in their right mind can argue for a single world currency. If a post modern civilization means less centralization, and less standardization, then a single currency ideal cannot become a reality. Just the opposite: we will most likely live in a future where a company like Starbucks will be able to issue its currency.

Why not? All it matters for a currency to be viable is people to trust it to be around when they use its fiat. I believe some companies and brand names' future is more certain, more solid than the future of the United States of America.

Plus: there is always the possibility of bartering to make a comeback. Utilizing fast computers and high-speed networks, we could even be trading without the use of any money. For trading big ticket items between countries, bartering is already being used now.
