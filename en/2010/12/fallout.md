# Fallout

We started witnessing actions taken by states that were influenced by cables released by Wikileaks. This organization is already shaping the global agenda.

I have to say, what I love about this mega info dump on the world's collective conscience is that it exceeds the capabilities of any centralized fuck, be it a prime minister, president, government to analyze it in its entirety. Of course the contents are also important. But the amount is its true disruptive power. I saw a tweet recently that Wikipedia is probably the only organization with enough manpower to sift through this data (and I saw the Wikipedia page on the leaks, they did through job). We have distributed leaking, distributed sharing, and distributed sifting / processing of the leaked data. New technologies empowered individuals to such degree that sharing the most secret information in the world takes couple clicks on one's keyboard.

This is what 3rd wave is all about. It is about technology changing the power dynamic so profoundly that no old institutional structure can stay the same.

It is already happening.

Today.
