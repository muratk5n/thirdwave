It is also interesting how starting with leaks, you jumped to law, then to the Catholic Church. Psychologically this reveals a form of thinking — the Catholic Church is a remnant of the Roman Empire which was another highly centralized system, and they used law as a means to subjugate peoples (the emperor cannot be everywhere but his law can). We added democracy later on, but the *machine* is only turned on at specified intervals.

Governments are just too big. The way they hoarde, generate secrets is very much comparible to their size. We need to ask the right questions here — it’s not a matter of how to do this / that under the current system; the question is how we build a new system that’ll allow the natural progression of things using our current technological infrastructure.
