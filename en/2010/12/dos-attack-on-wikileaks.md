# DoS Attack on Wikileaks

Apparently some people ran a DoS (denial of service) attack Wikileaks site, trying to keep it busy, so others cannot access it...

These people are clearly stupid.

The nature of Internet is distributed (in stark contrast to industrial forms of organization which are highly centralized), there is no point in attacking "a single" site if you want to "stop" Wikileaks. Because you cant. We will get the files either way. It's all distributed.
