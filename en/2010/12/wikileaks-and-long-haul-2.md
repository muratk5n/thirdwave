# Wikileaks and the Long Haul - 2

More comments on this post

According to Clotaire Rapaille who is a psychologist / marketing researcher, we tend to view the word through the prism of culture codes. For example the code for a car in US is IDENTITY, the code for an alcholic beverage is GUN. Also each country has its own cultural fault line, there is a constant tug-of-war across this fault line, and people tend to cluster in one side of this cultural line.

The cultural fault line in US is between freedom (as in letting go) and prohibition. This is why Clinton had so much trouble in his second term, and a scream could finish Howard Dean.

Now let's look at this Wikileaks debacle; someone looks as if they are "letting go" and immediately "the other side" forms, and they want to "contain things".

But intellectually this is not the issue here. We are talking about technology, evolution, not *choices* per se. There is no way to contain anything electronically, and no single person is "freeing" anything. People who are working, thinking using computers who are used to certain things are just doing something that comes normal to them. MANY people are contacting Wikileaks releasing stuff because technologically it's so easy. If it can happen, it will happen.

A generation that is used to Googling stuff for everything wants to Google and find all details about its government.

Previous generations built a government structure based on technology they had.

We need to build another form of structure that is built on today's technology. Not yesterday's.
