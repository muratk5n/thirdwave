# Gays in Military

US finally passed a law to allow gays to serve openly in the military. I remember it like yesterday of how this issue bit the Clinton presidency in the ass in its first few days; As George Stephenapolous wrote in his memoir "[paraphrasing] an issue that involved sex and Clinton was too good to pass up". So the opposition and the media had attacked his presidency like mad dogs.

All of this confirms Rapaille's analysis on America perfectly -- its cultural tug-of-war is between freedom (as in letting go) and prohibition. Gays serving openly in the military was perceived as "letting go" but serving secretly was "prohibiting" themselves from sharing this information. Of course, being gay or straight is a whole another letting go / prohibition type of act.

To which I say: screw culture, and screw culture codes.

We need to rule our societies intellectually.

US did the right thing this time. Congrats.
