# Esoteric Knowledge

I am a sponge for esoteric gems that is / might be outside of mainstream -- for example blood type diet / character profiling happens to be one of these areas. This is interesting, I realized with few data points I get on someone, I am able to reach a conclusion on certain aspects on their character.

FACT: Only blood type O's are into competitive, one-on-one sports (like basketball, football). A, B, AB do not give a f.ck (if they say they do, they are lying). Blood type B's average height is highest among other btypes, A's are usually law-abiding, B's are adaptable, AB's are sort-of an in-between (they are pretty new in the human evolution).

So recently I saw a friend of mine, who is not into sports, is short, and always trying to "fit in".

By process of elimination, B is out (he is short), O is out (he is not into sports); so I ask him "you are blood type A right?". He goes "how the fuck did you know?". :) This friend was also Jewish, so he was doubly freaked out, but I was just whopping around this esoteric knowledge, nothing more.

I could have continued from there saying this and that type of food (like beer) is not good for him, he should watch for stress (more than O's) etc... There is a wealth of other stuff you can get into from there. But remember how this started -- with few data points.

This is powerful shit.
