# F.cking Modernity.. Slowly..

Centralized, concentrated "boxes" that are called bureucracies will meet their end soon enough.

Many people think that security breaches of this sort will lead to a crackdown on free speech over the Internet. Certainly there will be bluster about that, but look at the U. S. government’s initial administrative response — telling the military and government employees they can no longer carry USB flash drives. How hopeless is that? Very. It’s a ban that is almost impossible to enforce. First there is the broad issue of what even constitutes a flash drive. Most smartphones certainly qualify, yet the new regs reportedly make no mention of them.

Bluetooth devices don’t even need to be attached. Nor does the Sheevaplug media server in our minivan, which synchronizes automatically with our home network over WiFi. While Shrek is what’s being transferred to our parking lot, who is to say it couldn’t be sensitive e-mails or documents?
