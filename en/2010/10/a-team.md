# The A-Team

I liked the movie. It definitely is on code. Highly skilled miliary men are on the run from the centralized military machine. We have autonomous "knights" representing Medieval Age, and against them, there is the centralized Rome. What is the name of A-Team's leader? Hannibal: One of the most feared enemies of Rome.

The cast: "Face" worked well, they picked someone who can be a mix between a party-boy and a tough-guy -- Dirk Benedict would have been proud. Liam Neeson's acting was top notch as usual, Hannibal's trademark grin through a cigar takes you back to the old A-Team from the 80s. This A-Team is grittier of course, but the seriousness was not overdone.

We also caught a glimpse of Mad Men's Jon Hamm at the end -- hopefully he will take the center stage as the new bad guy in a possible sequel.
