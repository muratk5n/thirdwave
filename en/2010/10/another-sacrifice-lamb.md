# Another Sacrifice Lamb

Lamb #2: The US Republican Party leader Michael Steele. We've all seen the skits on The Daily Show; like the one with a Steele puppet saying things like "heey, what's up baby (trying to be cool and failing -miserably-)". So the Republican Party has, just like British Labor Party chosen someone not of highest caliber for an important office. Steele is pretty much cannon fodder for late night comedians.

And that was precisely RNC's intention from the start. A black man was elected as President, so they counter this "cool black" with an "uncool black". They are basically saying "see, not all blacks are like Obama", hence trying to remove an advantage, a bonus from the next race.

The tactic is disgusting.

That it is blatantly obvious and transparent makes it even more disgusting.
