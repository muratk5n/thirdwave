# New Institutionalists?

My response to Murat Iyigun -- who is talking out of his ass. Again

I've been following your blog - it gives great insight on not that think, and not to follow. Your post on Avatar was dumb-ass to say the least, and downright stupid to say the worst. You did not disappoint with your last post on institutions either.

Turkey being "burdened with its archaic and outdated political arrangements" is no illusion. You look old enough to remember the coups that happened in Turkey - all of them unjust, most of them provoked. Military had an hand in preparing the conditions so the coups could take place. This doesn't sound archaic to you? They themselves admitted that their actions were partly responsible for PKK terorism. So who are you defending? They are not even defending themselves!
