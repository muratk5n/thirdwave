# De Vany on Econtalk

When it comes to dieting, De Vany got part of the picture right
although he is describing is a diet suitable for blood type O. This
blood type is the oldest type, therefore has hunter gatherer
roots. The fact that you guys talked about sports for half an hour
before covering this topic is no coincidence because O is the only
blood type who is into competitive sports (the others have no interest
in it, whatsoever). De Vany talks about milk; again, "Type O" cannot
digest milk, they have problem dairy products. But other types AB, B
have no problem digesting dairy.

De Vany is on the right 'track' in so many ways, he just misses the
final and crucial point somehow. When hunter gatherers settled down
and started organized farming, yes this was different and in many
ways, unsuitable for type O. However, this is when evolution shifted
gears, and some O's evolved into type A. Type A is the 'farmer' blood
type and naturally, they have no problems eating grains.

But I benefited from this talk, especially the parts on insulin, heart
having to be at irregular rythm forth, only the dieting part needs a
little work. For more details on Blood Type Diet, you can search Peter
D'Adamo on the Web.
