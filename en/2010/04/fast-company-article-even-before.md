# Corridors..
Fast Company articleEven before students set foot in a classroom, most schools still are  built like factories: long hallways, lined with metal lockers, transport  students to identical, self-contained classrooms. School designers call  these hallways "double-loaded corridors." The factory model of control  and direct instruction still pervades most new schools. If we are to  have thorough-going school reform, we must change the design model, too,  starting with the place students first enter the school.
