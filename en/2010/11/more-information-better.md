# The More Information, the Better

I see fools berating Wikileaks for releasing this much information. There is no need to worry. The Third Wave is coming, information, data wants to be free and will be free. There is nothing anyone can do about it.

Learn to like it.

Love it.

In order to manage this fast-paced, subsecond world we live in, we need more, not less data. "Oh but won't we be overwhelmed by a lot of data?". No you wont. Filters will develop, new techologies will spring up that you've never thought of. to handle this data overflow. Human society as a whole is a big whopping information processing machine.

One can argue that one of the reasons of 2008 crisis is we did not have enough data on the economy. If we knew every trade, every position, every detail about the economy, companies, one could develop monitoring software to sift through the data, raise alarms and report realtime.

My job was / is processing data in all forms; and I am telling you, more data is preferable.

So naysayers need to shut the fuck up and smell the coffee.
