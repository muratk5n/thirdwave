# No Worse than a White Man

Maybe there is a psychological block preventing Obama becoming the reformer he promised to be on the 2008 campaign trail. It's because he is black.

Hold your horses: this was no racist comment.

What I am saying is, as the first black president Obama might be thinking he is "representing", and if he fails, fails big, people will think it was "because he was black". So, he is not taking big steps, preventing big fail, but not accomplishing much, following pretty much other white men as an example that came before him. That's why we had a Clinton era economist, Bush era defense secretary, Clinton-era, well.. Clinton on the White House. Obama became an eclectic mix of white people before him, and this way, he guaranteed he would not be any worse than a white man.

But white or black, brown or yellow, the reality remains: We are going through changes that no person in any color has witnessed before. Americans elected Obama to do things different. If he fails, I am afraid he will not be a two-term president. But maybe, that's enough for him.

After all, it's no worse than a white man.
