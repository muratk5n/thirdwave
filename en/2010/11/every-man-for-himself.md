# Every Man For Himself

Quantitative Easing policy pursued by US proves that we are living in
a new world disorder. US is not acting as a superpower -- it is only
pursuing a strategy for its own self-interest, and that will
indirectly force China to change [1].

This is a good thing. From a different subject area, in traffic
pattern analysis it was observed in simulations that if each actor in
the simulation is driving very aggressively, all of a sudden an
optimal condition is reached and the traffic starts flowing as though
in sync, flawlessly [2].

[1] If US was able to construct a world order, it would simply tell
China to fix its currency, and roses would boom, pigs would fly, et
cetera, et cetera.
