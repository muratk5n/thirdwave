# Obama's Loss

Obama got what he deserved. After his big election win in 2008, he had to push for bigger changes, and when faced with resistence, take the fight to the populace, labeling the other side as "the ones stopping the change", and watch things develop from there.

Instead, what we got since 2008 has a meager health-care bill, meager reforms in economy, coupled with an utter inability to dissect what is wrong with education establishment. Oh, also some very odd comments about "saving newspapers' who are dinaseurs of the (previous) modern age.

From 3rd wave point of view, Obama "used" technology to win, but failed to understant its consequences in terms of social change. He keeps harping about "standards" for classrooms, for teachers in an age where the very existence of these concepts are in question.

The "darkness" inside leftists always has been modernity. We need to shed the industrial mindset, destroy / remove every trace of policy that are related to concepts like concentration, standardization, maximization and centralization.
