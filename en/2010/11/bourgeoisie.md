# Bourgeoisie

This term fails to be relevant in a hyper-connected, digital 3rd wave society.

First of all Marx was wrong. In a smokestack economy the power belongs to integrator elite, who control how to connect the disparate parts of the economy, not to "rich people". Therefore "owning" the means of production is of no importance. As demonstrated in history when the "ownership" changed hands in communist societies, an integrator elite formed itself immediately and became the ruler class.

"Money" is not the defining factor of this ruling class; the ability to connect, is.

Knowledge economies turn this pyramid upside down.

In a society where everyone owns a cellphone, individuals have much more power, democracy than a society in which there are tens of thousands in the so-called bourgeoisie class.

Marxist morons need to rethink their worldview. Their vocabulary, priorities are outdated. Marx belittled people doing mindwork, he called them "unproductive".

Well, computer age busted Marx's ass. The entire postmodern economy is the proof of this.
