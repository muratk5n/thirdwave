Encouraging/Discouraging words from President Obama

My comments on Obama's comments to teacher's unions: "We want to work with you; we're not interested in imposing changes on you...you can't defend the status quo in which a third of our kids are dropping out...when you've got 2,000 schools across the country that are drop-out factories"

Obama is redundant while describing the situation: schools are not "drop-out factories", they are simply "factories". They are organized to "process" kids as though they are on an assembly line, to be ready for a workforce that does not exist. Obama also talked about "standards" that are part of a backward industrial system. He proved he still doesn't get it.

We have the means to bring quality education to everyone; and it's called the Internet. We also need to stop trying to "teach" the kids, instead, let them try to figure things on their own.
