# Smallville Season 9 Finale

It is almost boring to know all the culture codes of a country sometimes, especially when it comes to its art... You have to know how to turn off the analysis if you want to be entertained. I was able to do it for a while, but after the show, the gears just start moving..

Season Finale of Smallville: boy, did it have an ample supply of Western World's cultural rift: the schism between Rome and Jesus / Middle Ages. They have this new dude from Krypton, and he gets superpowers, blah blah.. Final scene, between Clark Kent and .. this guy. Let me give you a few soundbites: "Might makes right" he (the bad guy) says. So Roman of you! Divide et imperium won't you?! And his opposite, Clark Kent is someone who identifies with humans, with the people. He wants to save them. Guess what happens in the final act. There is some kind of blue kryptonite gizmo shabang that .. ok, let me say if the shabang is far from the Roman dude, he can disappear. So what does Clark do?

Stabs himself with it, and falls off the skyscraper. He takes the punishment. He sacrifices himself for our sins! I am going to cry... (not). Just like Jesus. The bad motherfucker goes away.. Just like Rome did .. or turned into Jesus.. well.. kind of.

The scene of Clark falling of the skyscraper with a blade in him was so crucification, and so Jesus. Like, crucified? Ah! So 0000's! Barf!

Like I said: Boring. But at the same time.. not. You have to know when to turn it off. After all, there are still Roman wanna be motherfuckers on this Earth.

Well.. F...k them.
