# Idiocracy

Hillarious movie. It talks about a future (500 years later) when hedonism is the rule of the day, extreme violence as entertainment is commonplace, and events resembling Gladiator fights in Rome are widely followed and celebrated.

People are basically idiots who cannot even perform simple arithmetic in their heads. Obviously, Idiocracy takes some of today's social problems, and projects some in to the future. In smaller scale, we are actually living in the world pictured in Idiocracy. Some jokes were really funny; Someone from 2006 is transported into the future, and there, he is constantly made fun of for talking "like a fag (he talks normally)" -- basically anyone smart in this world "sounds like a fag". In one scene, someone mocks our guy "look, you talk just like this [mocks him]", and another guy in earshot pops in on the screen and says "oh sorry, I really thought there were two of you there for a while". Another one: The President of United States is called "Dwayne Elizondo Mountain Dew Herbert Camacho" and is a former wrestler.

Crazy shit. I loved it.
