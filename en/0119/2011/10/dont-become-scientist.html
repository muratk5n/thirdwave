<h1>Don't Become A Scientist</h1>
<p>Jonathan I. Katz, Professor of Physics, Washington University article</p>
<p>Are you thinking of becoming a scientist? Do you want to uncover the
mysteries of nature, perform experiments or carry out calculations to
learn how the world works? Forget it!</p>
<p>Why am I (a tenured professor of physics) trying to discourage you
from following a career path which was successful for me? Because
times have changed (I received my Ph.D. in 1973, and tenure in
1976). American science no longer offers a reasonable career path [..]</p>
<p>American universities train roughly twice as many Ph.D.s as there are
jobs for them. When something, or someone, is a glut on the market,
the price drops. In the case of Ph.D. scientists, the reduction in
price takes the form of many years spent in ``holding pattern''
postdoctoral jobs. Permanent jobs don't pay much less than they used
to, but instead of obtaining a real job two years after the Ph.D. (as
was typical 25 years ago) most young scientists spend five, ten, or
more years as postdocs [..]</p>
<p>Of course, you don't go into science to get rich. So you choose not to
go to medical or law school, even though a doctor or lawyer typically
earns two to three times as much as a scientist (one lucky enough to
have a good senior-level job). I made that choice too. I became a
scientist in order to have the freedom to work on problems which
interest me. But you probably won't get that freedom. As a postdoc you
will work on someone else's ideas, and may be treated as a technician
rather than as an independent collaborator. Eventually, you will
probably be squeezed out of science entirely.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are so talented that you can beat the postdoc trap; some
university (there are hardly any industrial jobs in the physical
sciences) will be so impressed with you that you will be hired into a
tenure track position two years out of graduate school. Maybe. But the
general cheapening of scientific labor means that even the most
talented stay on the postdoctoral treadmill for a very long time;
consider the job candidates described above. And many who appear to be
very talented, with grades and recommendations to match, later find
that the competition of research is more difficult, or at least
different, and that they must struggle with the rest.</p>
<p>Suppose you do eventually obtain a permanent job, perhaps a tenured
professorship. The struggle for a job is now replaced by a struggle
for grant support, and again there is a glut of scientists. Now you
spend your time writing proposals rather than doing research. Worse,
because your proposals are judged by your competitors you cannot
follow your curiosity, but must spend your effort and talents on
anticipating and deflecting criticism rather than on solving the
important scientific problems. They're not the same thing: you cannot
put your past successes in a proposal, because they are finished work,
and your new ideas, however original and clever, are still
unproven. It is proverbial that original ideas are the kiss of death
for a proposal; because they have not yet been proved to work (after
all, that is what you are proposing to do) they can be, and will be,
rated poorly [..].</p>
<p>What can be done? The first thing for any young person (which means
anyone who does not have a permanent job in science) to do is to
pursue another career. This will spare you the misery of disappointed
expectations. Young Americans have generally woken up to the bad
prospects and absence of a reasonable middle class career path in
science and are deserting it. If you haven't yet, then join
them. Leave graduate school to people from India and China, for whom
the prospects at home are even worse. I have known more people whose
lives have been ruined by getting a Ph.D. in physics than by drugs.</p>
