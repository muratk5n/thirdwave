<h1>Work Treadmill</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.1843magazine.com/features/why-do-we-work-so-hard">Avent, The Economist</a></p>
<p>[M]y work – the work we lucky few well-paid professionals do every
day, as we co-operate with talented people while solving complex,
interesting problems – is fun. And I find that I can devote surprising
quantities of time to it.</p>
<p>What is less clear to me, and to so many of my peers, is whether we
should do so much of it. One of the facts of modern life is that a
relatively small class of people works very long hours and earns good
money for its efforts. Nearly a third of college-educated American
men, for example, work more than 50 hours a week. Some professionals
do twice that amount, and elite lawyers can easily work 70 hours a
week almost every week of the year.</p>
<p>Work, in this context, means active, billable labour. But in reality,
it rarely stops. It follows us home on our smartphones, tugging at us
during an evening out or in the middle of our children’s bedtime
routines. It makes permanent use of valuable cognitive space, and
chooses odd hours to pace through our thoughts, shoving aside whatever
might have been there before. It colonises our personal relationships
and uses them for its own ends. It becomes our lives if we are not
careful. It becomes us.</p>
<p>[..When] Keynes mused in 1930 that, a century hence, society might be
so rich that the hours worked by each person could be cut to ten or 15
a week, he was not hallucinating, just extrapolating [..]. In those
decades after the second world war, Keynes seemed to have the better
of the argument. As productivity rose across the rich world, hourly
wages for typical workers kept rising and hours worked per week kept
falling – to the mid-30s, by the 1970s.</p>
<p>But then something went wrong. Less-skilled workers found themselves
forced to accept ever-smaller pay rises to stay in work. The
bargaining power of the typical blue-collar worker eroded as
technology and globalisation handed bosses a whole toolkit of ways to
squeeze labour costs. At the same time, the welfare state ceased its
expansion and began to retreat, swept back by governments keen to
boost growth by cutting taxes and removing labour-market
restrictions. The income gains that might have gone to workers, that
might have kept living standards rising even as hours fell, that might
have kept society on the road to the Keynesian dream, flowed instead
to those at the top of the income ladder. Willingly or unwillingly,
those lower down the ladder worked fewer and fewer hours. Those at the
top, meanwhile, worked longer and longer.</p>
<p>It was not obvious that things would turn out this way. You might have
thought that whereas, before, a male professional worked 50 hours a
week while his wife stayed at home with the children, a couple of
married professionals might instead each opt to work 35 hours a week,
sharing more of the housework, and ending up with both more money and
more leisure. That didn’t happen. Rather, both are now more likely to
work 60 hours a week and pay several people to care for the house and
children.</p>
<p>Why? One possibility is that we have all got stuck on a
treadmill. Technology and globalisation mean that an increasing number
of good jobs are winner-take-most competitions. Banks and law firms
amass extraordinary financial returns, directors and partners within
those firms make colossal salaries, and the route to those coveted
positions lies through years of round-the-clock work. The number of
firms with global reach, and of tech start-ups that dominate a market
niche, is limited. Securing a place near the top of the income
spectrum in such a firm, and remaining in it, is a matter of constant
struggle and competition. Meanwhile the technological forces that
enable a few elite firms to become dominant also allow work, in the
form of those constantly pinging emails, to follow us everywhere.</p>
