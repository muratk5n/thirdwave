<h1>The Second Machine Age</h1>
<p>Could [globalization]  be the reason that median wages have stagnated
in the United States and other advanced economies? A number of
thoughtful economists have made exactly that argument. The story is
one of factor price equalization. This means that in any single
market, competition will tend to bid the prices of the factors of
production—such as labor or capital—to a single, common price. Over
the past few decades, lower transaction in communication costs have
helped create one big global market for many products and services.</p>
<p>Businesses can identify and hire workers with skills they need
anywhere in the world. If a worker in China can do the same work as an
American, then what economists call “the law of one price” demands
that they earn essentially the same wages, because the market will
arbitrage away differences just as it would for other
commodities. That’s good news for the Chinese worker, and for overall
economic efficiency. But is not good news for the American worker who
now faces low-cost competition. A number of economists have made
exactly this argument. Michael Spence, in his brilliant book The Next
Convergence, explains how the integration of global markets is leading
to enormous dislocations, especially in labor markets.</p>
<p>The factor price equalization story yields a testable prediction:
American manufacturers would be expected to shift production overseas,
where costs are lower. And indeed manufacturing employment in the
United States has fallen over the past twenty years; economists David
Autor, David Dorn, and Gordon Hanson estimate that competition from
China can explain about a quarter of the decline in U.S. manufacturing
employment.</p>
<p>However, when one looks more closely at the data, the globalization
story becomes much less compelling. Since 1996, manufacturing
employment in China itself has actually fallen as well, coincidentally
by an estimated 25 percent. That’s over thirty million fewer Chinese
workers in that sector, even while output soared by 70 percent. It’s
not that American workers are being replaced by Chinese workers. It’s
that both American and Chinese workers are being made more efficient
by automation. As a result, both countries are producing more output
with fewer workers.</p>
<p>In the long run, the biggest effect of automation is likely to be on
workers not in America and other developed nations, but rather in
developing nations that currently rely on low-cost labor for their
competitive advantage.  If you take most of the costs of labor out of
the equation by installing robots and other types of automation, then
the competitive advantage of low wages largely disappears. This is
already beginning to happen. Terry Guo of Foxconn has been
aggressively installing hundreds of thousands of robots to replace an
equivalent number of human workers. He says he plans to buy millions
more robots in the coming years. The first wave is going into
factories in China and Taiwan, but once an industry becomes largely
automated, the case for locating a factory in a low-wage country
becomes less compelling. There may still be logistical advantages if
the local business ecosystem is strong, making it easier to get spare
parts, supplies, and custom components. But over time inertia may be
overcome by the advantages of reducing transit times for finished
products and being closer to customers, engineers and designers,
educated workers, or even regions where the rule of law is
strong. This can bring manufacturing back to America, as
entrepreneurs like Rod Brooks have been emphasizing.</p>
<p>A similar argument applies outside of manufacturing. For instance,
interactive voice-response systems are automating jobs in call
centers.  United Airlines has been successful in making such a
transition. This can disproportionally affect low-cost workers in
places like India and the Philippines. Similarly, many medical doctors
used to have their dictation sent overseas to be transcribed. But an
increasing number are now happy with computer transcription. In more
and more domains, intelligent and flexible machines, not humans in
other countries, are the most cost-effective source for ‘labor.’</p>
<p>If you look at the types of tasks that have been offshored in the past
twenty years, you see that they tend to be relatively routine,
well-structured tasks. Interestingly, these are precisely the tasks
that are easiest to automate. If you can give precise instructions to
someone else on exactly what needs to be done, you can often write a
precise computer program to do the same task. In other words,
offshoring is often only a way station on the road to automation.</p>
<p>In the long run, low wages will be no match for Moore’s Law. Trying to
fend off advances in technology by cutting wages is only a temporary
protection. It is no more sustainable than asking folk legend John
Henry to lift weights to better compete with a steam-powered hammer.</p>
