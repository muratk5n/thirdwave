<h1>The Uninhabitable Earth</h1>
<p>Even when we train our eyes on climate change, we are unable to
comprehend its scope. This past winter, a string of days 60 and 70
degrees warmer than normal baked the North Pole[..] Until recently,
permafrost was not a major concern of climate scientists, because, as
the name suggests, it was soil that stayed permanently frozen. But
Arctic permafrost contains 1.8 trillion tons of carbon, more than
twice as much as is currently suspended in the Earth’s
atmosphere. When it thaws and is released, that carbon may evaporate
as methane, which is 34 times as powerful a greenhouse-gas warming
blanket as carbon dioxide when judged on the timescale of a century;
when judged on the timescale of two decades, it is 86 times as
powerful. In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice
as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet,
all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved
up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power
86 times over.[..]</p>
<p>Most people talk as if Miami and Bangladesh still have a chance of
surviving; most of the scientists I spoke with assume we’ll lose them
within the century, even if we stop burning fossil fuel in the next
decade. Two degrees of warming used to be considered the threshold of
catastrophe: tens of millions of climate refugees unleashed upon an
unprepared world. Now two degrees is our goal, per the Paris climate
accords, and experts give us only slim odds of hitting it. The
U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues serial reports,
often called the “gold standard” of climate research; the most recent
one projects us to hit four degrees of warming by the beginning of the
next century, should we stay the present course. But that’s just a
median projection. The upper end of the probability curve runs as high
as eight degrees — and the authors still haven’t figured out how to
deal with that permafrost melt.</p>
<p>The IPCC reports also don’t fully account for the albedo effect (less ice means less reflected and more absorbed sunlight, hence more warming); more cloud cover (which traps heat); or the dieback of forests and other flora (which extract carbon from the atmosphere). Each of these promises to accelerate warming, and the history of the planet shows that temperature can shift as much as five degrees Celsius within thirteen years. The last time the planet was even four degrees warmer, Peter Brannen points out in The Ends of the World, his new history of the planet’s major extinction events, the oceans were hundreds of feet higher.</p>
<p>The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions before the one we are living through now, each so complete a slate-wiping of the evolutionary record it functioned as a resetting of the planetary clock, and many climate scientists will tell you they are the best analog for the ecological future we are diving headlong into. [..Y]ou probably read in your high-school textbooks that these extinctions were the result of asteroids. In fact, all but the one that killed the dinosaurs were caused by climate change produced by greenhouse gas.</p>
<hr />
<p>I wonder if we could crowdsource a  sort of "atmospheric cleansing" process to individuals; a Swiss company constructed a giant carbon sucking machine, if this tech becomes smaller and cheaper, anyone can run it at home, ACs could come preinstalled with it, you turn AC, it gives cold air, and cleans up the atmosphere at the same time.. Otherwise, judging by the rate events are developing, we are sleepwalking into a extinction level event. None of these accords / agreements will be enough, countries will cheat, deniers can assume office (see US), too many things can go wrong. We need a robust solution.</p>
<p>Some back-of-the-envolope calculations: Earth atmosphere is about 10 billion km^3. If  5 billion ppl were using the system, 2 km^3 would have to be processed by one person, in a few decades. Combined with a number of giant nodes (gov, colleges, nonprofits), we might be able to process it all.</p>
<p>Actually I like this approach better than some of the other geoengineering ideas, like sprinkling tiny particles in high atmo trying to reflect back sunlight.</p>
