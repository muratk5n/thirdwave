<h1>Malevolence? Incompetence?</h1>
<p>NBC is reporting that the [Trump’s Executive Order on visas and
refugees] document was not reviewed by DHS, the Justice Department,
the State Department, or the Department of Defense, and that National
Security Council lawyers were prevented from evaluating it. [..]</p>
<p>As readers of my work know, I believe in strong counterterrorism
powers. I defend non-criminal detention. I’ve got no problem with
drone strikes. I’m positively enthusiastic about American surveillance
policies. I was much less offended than others were by the CIA’s
interrogations in the years after September 11. I have defended
military commissions.[..]</p>
<p>[But t]he document is both wildly over-inclusive and wildly
under-inclusive. On the over-inclusive side, it will keep tens of
thousands of innocent refugees who have been subject to unspeakable
violence outside of the protection of the United States on the
vanishingly small chance that these people might be terrorists—indeed,
to make it impossible for them even to apply for refugee admission if
they are Syrian. It will prevent untold numbers of people about whom
there is no whiff of suspicion from coming here as students, as
professionals, as tourists. It overtly treats members of a particular
religion differently from other people.</p>
<p>On the underinclusive side, the order wouldn’t have blocked the entry
of many of the people responsible for the worst recent terrorist
attacks. There is, in fact, simply no rational relationship between
cutting off visits from the particular countries that Trump targets
(Muslim countries that don’t happen to be close U.S. allies) and any
expected counterterrorism goods. The 9/11 hijackers, after all, didn’t
come from Somalia or Syria or Iran; they came from Saudi Arabia and
Egypt and a few other countries not affected by the order. Of the San
Bernardino attackers (both of Pakistani origin, one a U.S. citizen and
the other a lawful permanent resident), the Orlando shooter (a
U.S. citizen whose parents were born in Afghanistan), and the Boston
marathon bombers (one a naturalized U.S. citizen, one a green card
holder who arrived in Massachusetts from Kyrgyzstan), none came from
countries listed in the order. One might argue, I suppose, that the
document is tied to current threats. But come now, how could Pakistan
not be on a list guided by current threat perception?</p>
<p>Put simply, I don’t believe that the stated purpose is the real
purpose. This is the first policy the United States has adopted in the
post-9/11 era about which I have ever said this. It’s a grave charge,
I know, and I’m not making it lightly. But in the rational pursuit of
security objectives, you don’t marginalize your expert security
agencies and fail to vet your ideas through a normal interagency
process. You don’t target the wrong people in nutty ways when you’re
rationally pursuing real security objectives.</p>
<p>When do you do these things? You do these things when you’re elevating
the symbolic politics of bashing Islam over any actual security
interest. You do them when you’ve made a deliberate decision to burden
human lives to make a public point. In other words, this is not a
document that will cause hardship and misery because of regrettable
incidental impacts on people injured in the pursuit of a public
good. It will cause hardship and misery for tens or hundreds of
thousands of people because that is precisely what it is intended to
do.</p>
