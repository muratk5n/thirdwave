<h1>UBI, Finland</h1>
<p>Finland has become the first country in Europe to pay its unemployed
citizens an unconditional monthly sum, in a social experiment that
will be watched around the world amid gathering interest in the idea
of a universal basic income.</p>
<p>Under the two-year, nationwide pilot scheme, which began on 1 January,
2,000 unemployed Finns aged 25 to 58 will receive a guaranteed sum of
€560 (£475). The income will replace their existing social benefits
and will be paid even if they find work.</p>
<p>Kela, Finland’s social security body, said the trial aimed to cut red
tape, poverty and above all unemployment, which stands in the Nordic
country at 8.1%. The present system can discourage jobless people from
working since even low earnings trigger a big cut in benefits.</p>
<p>“For someone receiving a basic income, there are no repercussions if
they work a few days or a couple of weeks,” said Marjukka Turunen, of
Kela’s legal affairs unit. “Working and self-employment are worthwhile
no matter what.”</p>
<p>The government-backed scheme, which Kela hopes to expand in 2018, is
the first national trial of an idea that has been circulating among
economists and politicians ever since Thomas Paine proposed a basic
capital grant for individuals in 1797.</p>
<p>Attractive to the left because of its promise to lower poverty and to
the right – including, in Finland, the populist Finns party, part of
the ruling centre-right coalition – as a route to a leaner, less
bureaucratic welfare system, the concept is steadily gaining traction
as automation threatens jobs.</p>
