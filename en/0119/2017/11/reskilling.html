<h1>Reskilling</h1>
<p>The question of how to soften the blow of recession is one of the most
complex, and retraining has traditionally been the only answer on
which all parties can agree. At the time of the GM closure,
Janesville-born Paul Ryan, now Republican speaker of the US House of
Representatives, and then president Barack Obama were unlikely allies
as cheerleaders for “reskilling”. But the local people charged with
channelling often generous public subsidies to those who need new
skills knew “a grittier, ground-level truth”, writes Goldstein:
“Retraining laid-off factory workers is not easy.”</p>
<p>Sharon Kennedy, who led the programme at Janesville’s Blackhawk
Technical College, laid out some of the obstacles in her own 2013
account. She wrote how Blackhawk was “unprepared for the
unpreparedness” of new students to use computers and in many cases had
to provide hands-on assistance to help them navigate the maze of
applications for training.</p>
<p>Goldstein ran what she described to me as “microcosmic” research into
the fate of Janesville’s workers and confirmed an even more worrying
truth. The obvious political solution of retraining what US welfare
jargon calls “dislocated workers” was ineffective. </p>
