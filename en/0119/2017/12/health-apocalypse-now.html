<h1>Health Apocalypse Now</h1>
<p>Much of my time for the past year has been spent navigating the
medical maze on behalf of my mother, who has dementia.</p>
<p>I observe that American health care organizations can no longer
operate systematically, so participants are forced to act in the
communal mode, as if in the pre-modern world.</p>
<p>Health care is one leading edge of a general breakdown in
systematicity—while, at the same time, employing sophisticated
systematic technologies.[..]</p>
<p>For complex health care problems, I recommend hiring a consultant to
provide administrative (not medical!) guidance.[..]</p>
<p>My mother’s mild dementia began accelerating rapidly a year ago. I’ve
been picking up pieces of her life as she drops them. That has grown
from a part-time job to a full-time job. In the past month, as she’s
developed unrelated serious medical issues, it’s become a
way-more-than-full-time job.</p>
<p>The most time-consuming aspect has been coordinating the dozens of
different institutions involved in her care. I had read that the
biggest failing of the American health care system is its
fragmentation; I’ve now spent hundreds of hours observing that
first-hand.</p>
<p>There is, in fact, no system. There are systems, but mostly they don’t
talk to each other. I have to do that.[..]</p>
<p>This is a stark example of medical cost disease, but the post is not
about that. It’s about how institutions fail to talk to each other—and
what that implies about our future.[..]</p>
<p>My mother went into the hospital a month ago with severe pain in her
hip. (It’s still undiagnosed.) After two days, she was medically ready
for discharge from the hospital: whatever the pain was, it wasn’t one
they could help with. Instead, she should be sent to a “skilled
nursing facility” (SNF) where she’d get “physical therapy,” i.e. leg
exercises.</p>
<p>For a SNF to agree to take her, they had to get confirmation from an
insurance company that insurance would cover her stay. She has two
kinds of health insurance, Medicare plus coverage through a private
insurer (Anthem). Which would cover her? Or both, or neither?</p>
<p>SNFs have admissions officers, whose full-time job is to answer this
question. Two different SNFs started working on the problem. I talked
with the admissions people every day. Both claimed to be working on it
more-or-less full-time. The hospital wanted to free up my mother’s
bed, so their insurance person was also working on it.</p>
<p>Days passed. The hospital doctor on rounds said “Well, this is
typical, especially with Anthem. It’s costing them several thousand
dollars a day to keep her here, versus a few hundred dollars a day in
a SNF, but it might take a week for them to figure out which local SNF
they cover. [..]</p>
<p>It’s like one those post-apocalyptic science fiction novels whose
characters hunt wild boars with spears in the ruins of a modern
city. Surrounded by machines no one understands any longer, they have
reverted to primitive technology.</p>
<p>Except it’s in reverse. Hospitals can still operate modern material
technologies (like an MRI) just fine. It’s social technologies that
have broken down and reverted to a medieval level.</p>
<p>Link</p>
<p>One of the pervasive ways women are disadvantaged under the ACA is its
reliance on employer-based coverage. In the United States, World War
II–era wage freezes helped entrench a system of employer-provided
health insurance, a perk meant to attract workers in a squeezed labor
market</p>
<p>Eventually, Medicare and Medicaid were devised as a safety net for
those shut out of private plans, and the ACA expanded that safety
net. Still, job-based plans remain the bedrock on which our insurance
system is built.</p>
<p>Under this system, it’s harder for women to get health insurance in
the first place. The strains of childrearing and elder care make women
more likely to seek more flexible employment, like part-time, remote,
or freelance work. These forms of employment tend not only to pay
less, but are less likely to include health insurance benefits.</p>
<p>Those that do provide inferior ones: companies with majority-female
workforces tend to offer less generous health-care coverage than those
that are majority male. And less than one-third of low-income workers
receive any health insurance through work. Jobs paying at or around
the minimum wage are most often occupied by women, the majority of
whom are women of color. Trans women face even higher levels of
poverty than cis women, and are frequently saddled with impossibly
high out of pocket costs.</p>
