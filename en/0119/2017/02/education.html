<h1>Education</h1>
<p>The U.S. has lost five million manufacturing jobs since 2000. [..] But
if you look at the facts, China isn’t taking manufacturing jobs,
robots are. Nearly 90 percent of the output of these vanished jobs
remained in the U.S. and was replaced by robots. Assembly line jobs
disappearing should not be seen as a problem, but as a sign of
progress (although it’s very tough for those who lost their
jobs). Before electricity, we had lamplighters to light and maintain
street lights; before alarm clocks, “knocker-uppers” would go to the
home of their clients and knock on the door. Today, we want to bring
back assembly line jobs that robots now perform?[..]</p>
<p>The Obama administration took a shot at trying to balance the
difference between employer demand and skilled workers with the
TechHire initiative. The goal: to expand tech talent pipelines,
especially alternative education organizations that could provide
U.S. citizens with IT skills.</p>
<p>The first $100 million pledge was passed by Congress in 2015, followed
by a $150 million funding in 2016. Coding bootcamps (the technical
high schools of this decade) were among the beneficiaries. They are
training the next generation of blue-collar workers: junior developers
who are taking jobs that require little expertise in tech, and there
are plenty of those.</p>
<p>But our economy is rapidly digitizing, and so should our
workforce. Leading companies in all industries are being disrupted by
newcomers who are rethinking their businesses by leveraging
software. Uber is not a “tech” company; it’s a transportation
company. Amazon isn’t a tech company either; it’s a retail
company. [..]</p>
<p>Bootcamps aren’t enough, and centuries-old college methods are
expensive, slow, and inefficient. Companies that need highly skilled
software engineers are starting to understand that the lack of talent
will not be solved anytime soon. If we want to reduce our dependence
on skilled immigrants, then we’ll have to find a way to fill this gap
within our own borders or risk losing the companies who need these
workers. For example, Google saw no choice but to try to solve this
education puzzle itself. [..] But education is not a core competence
of most technology companies. We have to find a better
solution.[..]. I hope [..] Betsy DeVos, will reshape the
U.S. education model to better produce the types of workers the
U.S. economy really needs.</p>
