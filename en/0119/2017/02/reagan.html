<h1>Reagan</h1>
<p>Ronald Reagan's basic views and the principles from which they were
derived stayed much the same through his presidential campaigns
described in this book. The fascinating point is the way he put them
to the electorate in his dramatically successful 1980
campaign. Basically, he didn't change, but he changed the way the
electorate saw issues [..]. The reason is that Reagan took positions
in the campaign based on principles that he well understood, and he
stuck to those principles during his presidency.  His rhetoric came
from the strength of his ideas [..].</p>
<p>Reagan's rise to the presidency in 1981 followed on his failed 1968
campaign for the Republican nomination and his close defeat by Gerald
Ford at the Republican convention. In the 1980 election, Republican
candidates benefited from Carter’s bad luck in being saddled with a
hostage crisis and a weak economy (if those were matters of
luck). But, as we will show, Reagan’s successful strategy was taking
clear shape well before these fortunate breaks came his way. He
capitalized on the opportunity when his Republican rivals failed to do
so. Success depended on his creativity in redefining issues, rather
than on his convincing voters that he had the right position on issues
as they had previously been understood [..].</p>
<p>We will see how Reagan progressed in his politicking, from a candidate
in 1976 who made rhetorical arguments about well-defined issues, to a
more sophisticated strategist who recast political debate in order to
construct a coalition that could win him the nomination without
weakening his prospects in the race against Jimmy Carter. Chapter 5
continues this theme, turning attention to Reagan’s successful bid
during the 1980 presidential election. Here we see that luck played a
part—he could not have anticipated that Jimmy Carter would face a
disastrous Iranian hostage crisis or a Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan—but also that Reagan laid out his winning strategy well
before Carter’s woes set in [..].</p>
<p>Reagan emphasized an unprecedented view that linked growth-oriented
economic policies with greatly increased military spending intended to
provoke a peaceful end to the Cold War. Reagan argued vigorously that
these policies could be linked to forge a stronger America, and by
doing so he built a coalition of voters that included socially
conservative, hawkish, blue-collar workers and socially conservative
conventional Republicans. That coalition persists to this day as
central to the Republican Party.</p>
<hr />
<p>The power of the Presidency does not reside in the executive's ability
to issue orders - which are heavily constrained against unilateral
action. The power comes from President's ability to convince others to
join him in a coalition. In other words, Reagan did not cause change
after he became President, he did it beforehand, worked on it for many
years.</p>
<p>Can Trump convince others to join him? It seems instead of ideas, he
uses cheap stunts to affect change. Can this strategy work?</p>
