<h1>Chia and the Blockchain</h1>
<p>Bram Cohen invented torrenting. Now he’s building a cryptocurrency
called Chia that doesn’t waste electricity like Bitcoin, and top
investors are lining up. Chia has just raised a $3.395 million seed
round led by AngelList’s Naval Ravikant and joined by Andreessen
Horowitz, Greylock and more. The money will help the startup build out
its Chia coin and blockchain powered by proofs of space and time
instead of Bitcoin’s energy-sucking proofs of work, which it plans to
launch in Q1 2019.</p>
<hr />
<p>Can I make a request? Could Chia also make its blockchain so it is
partitioned  (some call this "sharding"), e.g. data is divided up and
stored in some / many (but not all) nodes, with some partitions
serving as backups, so all data does not have to reside in one place
and it does not get lost. The word is Bitcoin blockchain requires
"official" nodes to download the ledger in full, this is a complete
waste of time. Since Chia creator is the "disk guy" he'll know all the
partitioning, distribution tricks. </p>
<p>I believe Ethereum has plans for partitioning, but did not implement
it yet. It'd be great if Chia supported this feature from get-go.</p>
<p>Also, if scripting / contract tech is compatible with the Lightning
Network, Chia could be integrated in this fast networking
infrastructure. LN is growing quite fast. I'd ride that wave.</p>
