<h1>Public Education</h1>
<p>Here we propose a scalable, government-led education system that can
reach everyone, can work offline/online and in distributed
fashion. The new aproach is based on the following tenets.</p>
<p>1) Course content is created by reputable professors, authors, who are
selected by the Department of Education (DOE). The lectures are
delivered to students through tablets owned by the school.</p>
<p>2) What was called a "teacher" now becomes a "certifier".</p>
<p>3) There is still a thing called "a school" with its building, and
classrooms which kids can go to.</p>
<p>4) Classes are graded on pass/fail basis, no more letter grades</p>
<p>Public education's most pressing problem is quality. The fastest way
to fix that is to stop the so-called teachers from teaching. The act
of content delivery needs to be taken away from them, instead, turned
over to electronic lectures, content created by a reputable researcher
/ author in his/her field.</p>
<p>Incentives for the authors to create content: DOE will have the
authority to increase an author's (who is a researcher) grant on any
subject by 20% if that researcher aggrees to generate content for a
specific subject. The grant increase will be paid by the author
grantor (such as NSF, DOD, etc). Written content will be based on
jupyter notebook technology which allows math, runable code, and text
to reside side-by-side in the same electronic document. The content
will be complemented by video lectures the author recorded by the
equipment sent to her by DOE.</p>
<p>Author can choose to point to someone else's work for content,
e.g. for algebra video lectures s/he can choose freely available
videos, have them used instead of his own recording.</p>
<p>It is important to have a researcher to generate content (or choose
one suitable), because only someone who knows a subject througly can
teach it simply.</p>
<p>The collection of courses a student takes depends completely on the
student's interest. A guardian can be part of this process, as well as
certifiers who can do double-duty as guides who know about more then
one subject.</p>
<p>The tablets will be made available to kids in a public area and
dropped off when done. Tablets will use a tech called docker
technology to reinitialize its content on demand, erasing previous
work, preinstalling a system with all of the necessary content on the
same machine. Programming on this machine will be possible, kids can
snoop around all they want because next kid can reinitialize a machine
to its original state. Programming language will be Python. Tablet's
OS will be based on Ubuntu Linux. Portable, lightweight keyboards
(also available at school) can be attached to tablets for easier
typing for programming purposes.</p>
<p>All lecture, video files will be local to the tablet. Its content,
part of its docker image will be synced with the school's server on
demand. School server, in turn, will occasionally sync its content
with DOE. This way DOE can centrally manage all course content from
its servers.</p>
<p>Author can enrich a subject in any way they want. They can (and
should) offer lab experiments based on software simulation. Recently I
saw a simulation for a famous experiment that allows the measurement
of a single electron's charge. Click Begin, it takes you to a setup
where a click on the round ball on the left spits out oil drops, click
on the virtual "microscope" it shows the oil drop "hanging" in the air
due to an "electric field", all simulated. This simulation code takes
only a few files, which can easily be included in the docker image for
the entire course. The kids today are so lucky (or, can be).</p>
<p>Professors who generated their content can grant certifier status to
professionals, who can pass the label to others. Certifiers will be
able to assign pass/fail grade to students on the classes they are
certified on. Certifiers will go to schools, not teach a class, but
remain available according to their schedule shared publicly with
students. Most likely they will sit in a loungy, classroom-ish area
while students who are studying are there with them, occasionally
asking them questions on issues they are stuck on. But students can
also ask eachother, but move on in their own pace, the flow of the
learning depends completely on the student.</p>
<p>A student, at any time, can ask to be certified, by which time the
certifier will set aside a time slot to do just that. If the certifier
deems the student learned the subject well enough, s/he will assign
them a pass grade.</p>
<p>I can see a lot of professionals becoming certified on subjects that
interest them, and going to schools to help kids with questions or
final certifications. They can do this even while still working
remotely, as certifiers are not teachers, they are not required to
deliver an entire lecture. A programmer with an early interest in
chemistry can become certified in the subject and spend some time at a
local school. Certifiers would be paid by the government based on the
time they spend at school.</p>
<p>The number of potential certifiers are enormous. Every society has a
lot of white-collar professionals, and all of them have the potential
to donate some of their time on a certain subject.</p>
<p>This new scheme does not involve "home schooling" as it is important
for kids being able to leave home, to go somewhere else, the home
environment or neighborhood might not be ideal for studying. With its
four walls and a building a school is still a school, albeit with a
somewhat different concept of classroom.</p>
<p>We are not talking about "Zoom schooling" either, which means an
old-style teacher talking to students in a synchronized fashion. Our
goal is to make lecturer/lectured communication async, breaking the
time dependency so that benefits of scale, and quality can be
achieved. The motto is record-once-teach-everywhere-anytime.</p>
