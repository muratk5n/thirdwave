<h1>Hyundai Nexo</h1>
<p>Hyundai jumped onto HFC bandwagon, with its Nexo. The car also has
Level 4 autonomous driving capability, and 600 km range on a full
tank.</p>
<p>Important point to stress: hydrogen stations are needed for fueling
cars, but stations (as well as homes actually) can generate hydrogen
themselves.</p>
<p>Hyundai hedged its bets, they make both battery and HFC based products.</p>
<p>Other news items:</p>
<p>2017, a green energy company Plug Power announced that Amazon [..] had
gained the rights to buy up to 23 percent of the firm, in a deal that
has Amazon spending $70 million in cash for fuel cells [...]. Plug
Power's system [.. replaces] battery charging with proton exchange
membrane (PEM) fuel cells and hydrogen systems designed to make
forklift operation more efficient.</p>
<p>A 2012 video talking about PEM, which requires platinum (expensive),
however recent developments drastically reduced the use of
platinum. Daimler’s new fuel-cell model, the Mercedes GLC F-Cell,
already uses 90 percent less platinum than its previous fuel cell
model, the B-Class F-Cell, [similarly for] Toyota, their Mirai is the
world’s best-selling fuel-cell car.</p>
<p>Toyota bet big on HFC. They released all their related patents for
everyone to use some time ago (2015).</p>
