<h1>String Theory, Multiverse, The Large Hadron Collider</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=12604">Peter Voit</a></p>
<p>Multiverse mania started seriously among string theorists around 2003,
with a defining event Susskind’s February 2003 The Anthropic Landscape
of String Theory. At the time I was finishing up writing what became
the book “Not Even Wrong”.. For many years I found it impossible to
believe that this pseudo-scientific point of view would get any
traction.. It has become clear recently that we’ve now reached that
end-point. From the new video of his discussion with Rovelli, it’s
clear that David Gross has given up. No more complaints about the
multiverse from him, and his vision of the future has string theory
solving QCD 80 years from now, nothing about it ever telling us
anything about where the Standard Model comes from</p>
<p>Unzicker, <em>Bankrupting Physics</em></p>
<p>I am not old enough to remember all the deaths the theory of
supersymmetry (SUSY) has died in the history of accelerator
experiments. Supersymmetry attempts to give a unified mathematical
description of elementary particles by postulating a collection of
mirror particles. The hypothetical twins are distinguished from the
known ones by their superheavy masses, and for that reason, remain
undetected so far in all particle colliders. The first big gravestone
was the DESY lab in Hamburg in 1978, where supersymmetry grossly
failed to predict the experimental outcome. But a really agonizing
year must have been 2012, when Scientific American published an
article in their May issue asking “Is Supersymmetry Dead?” and not the
slightest trace of supersymmetry could be found in the
long-sought-after Large Hadron Collider data at CERN.</p>
<p>Peter Woit commented in his blog 1 Not Even Wrong, “The paradigm that
dominated the subject for the past 30 years has collapsed in the face
of experimental (non)evidence, threatening to take down the life’s
work of hundreds if not thousands of theorists.” However, the really
die-hard adherents argue that “not the whole parameter space” has been
checked yet, comparing the search for supersymmetry to a game in which
your friend assures you that a pea is hidden under one of the five
cups put upside down on a table. You have turned over four cups. Now
do you still trust that the pea will show up under the fifth?  Of
course...</p>
<p>The reason behind the supersymmetry hype is the ugly complication of
the standard model. With its arbitrary concepts, it leaves an
unpleasant aftertaste, and this is an inspiration to look out for a
more uniform, more beautiful theory, just like bleak industrial
suburbs foster a desire for palm-decorated paradises.</p>
<p>The standard models of cosmology and particle physics are ailing, but
theoretical physics overall is in a much worse shape. There has been
no real output at all in the past decades. Strings, inflation, and
multiverses have formed gigantic bubbles of speculation that can
barely hide their ridiculously empty content. It is likely that
theorists will aggressively defend their bogus fantasies for some time
yet. But the higher-dimensional rigmarole will eventually be
identified by the public and deflated. When the fantasies end in
smoke, physics will be left without any credible theory. It will have
lost its credibility...</p>
<p>The parallel worlds, called multiverses, are perfectly suited for the
nasty question of why fundamental constants have the numerical values
we observe.  With a fine structure constant of, say, 5.3 instead of
137.036, carbon atoms could not form and neither could theoretical
physicists. The explanation is that nature is producing invisible
universes with all conceivable constants, and we happily live in one
where life was possible. Of course, such arguments open the floodgates
to arbitrary nonsense, as, for example, when theorists linked the
fluctuations in empty space to the cosmological
constant. Unfortunately the latter is too small by 120 decimal places!
This could be called the wrongest prediction ever, but it does not
harm the beauty of theory, when one cooks up an explanation using
parallel universes.</p>
<p>Smolin, <em>Einstein's Unfinished Revolution</em></p>
<p>A vocal minority of cosmologists proclaims that the universe we see
around us is only a bubble in a vast ocean called the multiverse that
contains an infinity of other bubbles. And, whereas it is safe to
hypothesize that the galaxies we can see are typical of the rest of
our universe, one must regard the other invisible bubbles as governed
by diverse and randomly assigned laws, so our universe is far from
typical of the whole. This, together with the fact that all, or almost
all, of the other bubbles are forever out of range of our
observations, means the multiverse hypothesis can never be tested or
falsified. This puts this fantasy outside the bounds of
science. Nonetheless, this idea is championed by not a few highly
regarded physicists and mathematicians.</p>
<p>It would be a mistake to confuse this multiverse fantasy for the Many
Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics. They are distinct ideas.
Nonetheless, they share a magical-realist subversion of the aim of
science to explain the world we see around us in terms of only
itself. I would suggest that the harm done to clarity about the aim
and purpose of science by the enthusiastic proponents of the
multiverse would not have been possible had not the majority of
physicists uncritically adopted anti-realist versions of quantum
physics.</p>
<p>Avi Loeb</p>
<p>Mainstream theoretical physicists now widely accept the study of
extra-spatial dimensions beyond the three we are all familiar with..
This is despite the fact that there is no evidence for any such extra
dimensions. Similarly, a hypothetical multiverse—an infinite number of
universes all existing simultaneously in which everything that could
conceivably happen is happening—occupies many of our planet’s most
admired minds, again despite the fact that there is no evidence that
such a thing is possible.</p>
<p>[P]hysicists [should] measure their success by how well their ideas
align with data rather than by how popular those ideas are.. But that
is not what we discover when we survey the landscape of theoretical
physics.  Fashions frequently dictate funding, sometimes despite
anything close to a commensurate return on investments.</p>
<p>Despite the absence of experimental evidence, the mathematical ideas
of supersymmetry, extra-spatial dimensions, string theory, Hawking
radiation, and the multiverse are considered irrefutable and
self-evident by the mainstream of theoretical physics. In the words of
a prominent physicist at a conference that I attended: “These ideas
must be true even without experimental tests to support them, because
thousands of physicists believe in them and it is difficult to imagine
that such a large community of mathematically gifted scientists could
be wrong.”</p>
<p>But go beyond the groupthink and look more closely at these ideas. For
instance, supersymmetry. This theory, which postulates that all
particles have partners, is not as natural as prominent theorists
predicted it would be. The latest data from the Large Hadron Collider
at CERN did not find any of the evidence expected at the energy scales
it probed to support supersymmetry.  Other speculative ideas
pertaining to the nature of dark matter, dark energy, extra
dimensions, and string theory have yet to be even tested.</p>
<p>Imagine that the data suggesting that Oumuamua is extraterrestrial
technology is stronger than the data suggesting supersymmetry theory
is valid. What might follow? Just a bit under five billion dollars was
spent to construct the Large Hadron Collider, a particle accelerator
built in hopes of attaining confirming evidence of supersymmetry, and
running it costs another one billion dollars a year. If the scientific
consensus eventually gives up on the theory, it will do so after vast
expense and generations of effort...</p>
<p>A host of theories beyond supersymmetry—the multiverse leaps to mind—
are given thoughtful, respectful attention in and out of the academy
despite the absence of evidence for them. That should give us pause,
and not because of the absence of evidence. Rather, it should concern
us because of what it reveals about the scientific enterprise itself...</p>
<p>An earlier generation of theoretical physicists was open to the
humility of seeing their theories proven wrong by experimental
data. But a new culture, one that thrives in its own theoretical sauce
and exercises influence over award committees and funding agencies, is
populated by advocates of popular yet unproven paradigms. When
scientists double down on supersymmetry despite the Large Hadron
Collider finding no evidence for it or when they insist that the
multiverse must exist despite there being no data to support the
theory, they are wasting precious time and money and talent. And we
have not only finite funds to spend, but finite time...</p>
<p>A scientific culture that has not learned this lesson—that does not
require external verification in observable, confirmable data and that
advocates for ideas deemed inherently correct due to their
mathematical beauty—strikes me as a culture at risk of losing its
grounding. Getting data and comparing it to our theoretical ideas
provides a reality check and tells us that we are not
hallucinating. What is more, it reconfirms what is central to the
discipline.  Physics is not a recreational activity intended to make
us feel good about ourselves. Physics is a dialogue with nature, not a
monologue. We are supposed to have skin in the game and make testable
predictions, and this requires that scientists put themselves at risk
of error.</p>
