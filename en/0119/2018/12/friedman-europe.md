Great talk. Key takeaways:

US lost in Afganistan

NATO is for Europe, but its bureucracy bogs down US, so it prefers to
act outside it, bileterally. Such a bilateral relation / mission is
maintaining troops in Romania, Poland, in Europe's eastern front,
against Russia.

US would rather have Europeans 'defend' the East.

US's unwritten priority is freedom of movement in the seas /
oceans. Because a sufficiently strong power can use the seas to reach
US.

Friedman is no war-monger. He is happy with less soldiers around the globe.

His talk outlines that strategy is made for the worst case scenario
which can have the worst impact. If you agree with the 'worst case',
then the rest flows from there.

US has never been isolationist. American _people_ are basically
isolationsts, Bill Clinton said once, he is correct on this one.

I add people's and the needs of governance can differ, in that case
people's solutions do not matter. Their needs obviously do, and who
they chose as their leader. Dont like the solution, change the leader.
But IMO the need for primacy of the seas at the government level will
never change, no matter who is the leader.
