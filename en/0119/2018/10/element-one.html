<h1>Element One</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/tech/tech-news/2018/10/04/worlds-first-hydrogen-electric-passenger-plane-to-take-off-in-2025/">News</a></p>
<p>"The world's first regional passenger plane powered by
hydrogen-electric power is set to take to the skies as early as 2025,
paving the way for a new generation of zero-emissions air travel. 
Designed to fly up to four passengers for distances between 500km to
5,000km, the Element One is described as a quiet, ultra-light, zero
carbon aircraft "several orders of magnitude better" than
battery-electric aircrafts".</p>
<p>I love the name. Probably comes from the fact that H is the first
element in the periodic table. Hydrogen on an aircraft is actually not
that far-fetched. NASA <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/space-applications-of-hydrogen-and-fuel-cells">used it</a>
as a rocket fuel for decades.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.now-gmbh.de/en/news/press/germanys-50th-hydrogen-refuelling-station-opened-in-potsdam">Link</a></p>
<p>"At the commissioning of the 50th public refuelling station [in
Potsdam Germany] H2 MOBLITY partners Linde and TOTAL celebrated [the
event]".</p>
<p>"Tesla Supercharging stations [..] take about 20 minutes to charge to
50%, 40 minutes to charge to 80%, and 75 minutes to 100%" Too
slow. Hyundai Nexo, or Toyota Mirai will refuel under 5 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMxUfBGvJvM">News</a></p>
<p>"No one has test-driven a hydrogen car for as long a distance as we
have. From the South Korean capital city of Seoul to southeastern port
city of Ulsan, we drove Hyundai Motors' Nexo for over 400 kilometers
on a single charge".</p>
<p>Looks like a comfortable ride.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.alphr.com/cars/1002996/jeremy-clarkson-thinks-hydrogen-fuel-is-the-future-of-cars">Jeremy Clarkson</a></p>
<p>"I'm baffled by the car industry's apparent reluctance to think more
seriously about hydrogen as a replacement for petrol and diesel, H is
the most abundant element in the universe, so we wouldn't run out of
it for about a billion years, and it's clean too. A car powered by
[HFC] produces nothing from its tailpipe but water [..] The motor
industry would stop fiddling about with its pointless batteries and
its hybrid-drive systems and get on the only road where there is
actually a future for personal mobility. The hydrogen road"</p>
