<h1>Skilled Work, Without the Worker</h1>
<p>DRACHTEN, the Netherlands — At the Philips Electronics factory on the
coast of China, hundreds of workers use their hands and specialized
tools to assemble electric shavers. That is the old way. At a sister
factory here in the Dutch countryside, 128 robot arms do the same work
with yoga-like flexibility. Video cameras guide them through feats
well beyond the capability of the most dexterous human.</p>
<p>This is the future. A new wave of robots, far more adept than those
now commonly used by automakers and other heavy manufacturers, are
replacing workers around the world in both manufacturing and
distribution. Factories like the one here in the Netherlands are a
striking counterpoint to those used by Apple and other consumer
electronics giants, which employ hundreds of thousands of low-skilled
workers.</p>
<p>“With these machines, we can make any consumer device in the world,”
said Binne Visser, an electrical engineer who manages the Philips
assembly line in Drachten. Many industry executives and technology
experts say Philips’s approach is gaining ground on Apple’s.</p>
<p>The falling costs and growing sophistication of robots have touched
off a renewed debate among economists and technologists over how
quickly jobs will be lost. This year, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew
McAfee, economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, made
the case for a rapid transformation. “The pace and scale of this
encroachment into human skills is relatively recent and has profound
economic implications,” they wrote in their book, “Race Against the
Machine.”</p>
<p>In their minds, the advent of low-cost automation foretells changes on
the scale of the revolution in agricultural technology over the last
century, when farming employment in the United States fell from 40
percent of the work force to about 2 percent today. The analogy is not
only to the industrialization of agriculture but also to the
electrification of manufacturing in the past century, Mr. McAfee
argues.</p>
<p>[..] Mike Dennison, an executive at Flextronics, a manufacturer of
consumer electronics products that is based in Silicon Valley and is
increasingly automating assembly work [says] “There’s always a price
point, and we’re very close to that point.”</p>
<p>Take the cavernous solar-panel factory run by Flextronics in Milpitas,
south of San Francisco. A large banner proudly proclaims “Bringing
Jobs &amp; Manufacturing Back to California!” [..] Yet in the
state-of-the-art plant, where the assembly line runs 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, there are robots everywhere and few human workers.</p>
