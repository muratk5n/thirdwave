<h1>The Fifth Protocol</h1>
<p>Cryptocurrencies will create a fifth protocol layer powering the next
generation of the Internet. Humans don’t need math-based
cryptocurrencies when dealing with other humans. We walk slowly, talk
slowly, and buy big things. Credit cards, cash, wires, checks – the
world seems fine.</p>
<p>Machines, on the other hand, are far chattier and quicker to exchange
information. The Four Layers of the Internet Protocol Suite are
constantly communicating [.. Right now t]his chatty, anonymous network
treats resources as “too cheap to meter.” It’s a giant grid that
transfers data but doesn’t transfer value.</p>
<p>DDoS attacks, email spam, and flooded VPNs result. Names and
identities are controlled by overlords – ICANN, DNS Servers, Facebook,
Twitter, and Certificate “Authorities.” [..]</p>
<p>Cryptocurrencies are an emergent property of the Internet – almost a
fifth protocol in the Internet suite [..] Someday, they will be used
by the machines in our network, on our desk, in our garage, and in our
pocket to exchange value and achieve consensus at blinding speeds,
anonymously, and at minimal cost. When that day arrives, large
distributed networks that we rely upon will change. Starting with the
Internet, they will become de-centralized market economies, far more
intelligent than they are today [..].</p>
<p>Eventually, there will be no functioning Internet or Internet of
Things at the protocol layer without deep cryptocurrency
integration. Turning off this fifth protocol will be impossible.</p>
