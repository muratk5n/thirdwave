<h1>Temple Activism</h1>
<p>If what we see going on in Israel-Palestine is not yet a third
Intifada, one may not be far off. As presented in the mainstream
press, the stabbings of Israeli settlers, the rock-throwing, the mass
uprisings, all seem chalked up to some inexplicable proclivity toward
violence on the part of Palestinians. Nothing could be further from
the truth. The fact of the matter is that this wave of violence comes
in response to an on-going campaign to desecrate and destroy holy
sites that anchor non-Jewish peoples to their faiths -- not only are
mosques being destroyed, so too are Catholic churches.Most
egregiously, Israeli groups are attempting to replace the al-Aqsa
mosque with a Jewish temple. In mid-September "Israeli forces entered
the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound's southern mosque on Tuesday sparking the
third straight day of violent clashes at the third holiest site in
Islam. Dozens of Palestinians were injured in the clashes, during
which Israeli forces fired stun grenades, tear gas canisters and
rubber-coated steel bullets at Palestinian worshipers." These efforts
are part of what is called "temple activism."</p>
