<h1>Target #1</h1>
<p>Most actors in Syria have other priorities besides destroying the
Islamic State. Almost all rebel groups insist on destroying Assad
before the Islamic State. They refuse to be drawn into what they call
a “sahwa.” They do not want to become “agents of America” and so
forth. The vast majority want nothing to do with the fight against
ISIS before they have defeated Assad. Many members of the Coalition
that are fighting ISIS also have other priorities. That is a big
problem for both for the Russians and for the U.S. Indeed, the US has
other priorities as well. We saw in Palmyra, Deir ez-Zor and
elsewhere, the US would not attack ISIS if it believed Assad and his
military would benefit. It preferred to have ISIS take Palmyra than to
be seen to be helping Assad.</p>
<p>[Question: So, why does the West keep supporting those rebels? For the
West it’s not a fight about removing Assad rather than fighting
Islamic State]</p>
<p>This is true, but many top US generals, like the Syrian opposition,
continue to insist that Assad is the magnet drawing ISIS into Syria
and thus must be destroyed first. This argument makes little
sense. After all, when did Al-Qaeda pour into Iraq? Only after Saddam
was deposed and the Americans ruled the country. I don’t think any of
the US generals who now claim that Assad must be destroyed in order to
defeat ISIS would also argue that America had to be destroyed in Iraq
in order to rid it of al-Qaida. If fact the US is building up the
Iranian supported Shiite regime in Iraq to destroy ISIS, whereas it is
seeking to destroy the Iranian backed “Shiite” regime in Damascus in
the name of destroying ISIS. The American policy in Iraq is to kill
al-Qaida not to accommodate it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The priorities seem all wrong; ISIS must be / should have been target</p>
<h1>1. As long as these fuckers exist, they will serve as propaganda, a</h1>
<p>rallying cry / an example for extremist tendencies of  young people
all over the world.</p>
<p>Once ISIS is taken care of Assad can be negotiated with. Landis also
says "fair elections would be near impossible in Syria". If a
concerted international effort is made, maybe it can be possible.</p>
<p>The most infuriating part of Landis' comment is this though: "We saw
in Palmyra, Deir ez-Zor and elsewhere, the US would not attack ISIS if
it believed Assad and his military would benefit.". This means US has
willingly given ISIS a free ride.</p>
