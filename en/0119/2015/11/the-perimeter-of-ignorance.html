<h1>The Perimeter of Ignorance</h1>
<p>Take the human form. We eat, drink, and breathe through the same hole
in the head, and so, despite Henry J. Heimlich's eponymous maneuver,
choking is the fourth leading cause of "unintentional injury death" in
the United States. How about drowning, the fifth leading cause? Water
coffers almost three-quarters of Earth's surface, yet we are land
creatures—submerge your head for just a few minutes, and you die.</p>
<p>Or take our collection of useless body parts. What good is the pinky
toe-nail? How about the appendix, which stops functioning after
childhood and thereafter serves only as the source of appendicitis?
Useful parts, too, can be problematic. I happen to like my knees, but
nobody ever accused them of being well protected from bumps and
bangs. These days, people with problem knees can get them surgically
replaced. As for our pain-prone spine, it may be a while before
someone finds a way to swap that out.</p>
<p>How about the silent killers? High blood pressure, colon cancer, and
diabetes each cause tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. every
year, but it's possible not to know you're afflicted until your
coroner tells you so. Wouldn't it be nice if we had built-in biogauges
to warn us of such dangers well in advance? Even cheap cars, after
all, have engine gauges.</p>
<p>And what comedian designer configured the region between our legs--an
entertainment complex built around a sewage system?</p>
<p>The eye is often held up as a marvel of biological engineering. To the
astrophysicist, though, it's only a so-so detector. A better one would
be much more sensitive to dark things in the sky, and to all the
invisible parts of the spectrum. How much more breathtaking sunsets
would be if we could see ultraviolet and infrared. How useful it would
be if, at a glance, we could see every source of microwaves' in the
environment, or know which radio station transmitters were active. How
helpful it would be if we could spot police radar detectors at night.</p>
<p>Think how easy it would be to navigate an unfamiliar city if we, like
birds, could always tell which way was north because of the magnetite
in our heads. Think how much better off we'd be if we had gills as
well as lungs, how much more productive if we had six arms instead of
two. And if we had eight, we could safely drive a car while
simultaneously talking on a cell phone, changing the radio station,
applying makeup, sipping a drink, and scratching our left ear.</p>
<p>Stupid design could fuel a movement unto itself. It may not be
nature's default, but it's ubiquitous. Yet people seem to enjoy
thinking that our bodies, our minds, and even our universe represent
pinnacles of form and reason. Maybe it's a good antidepressant to
think so. But it's not science—not now, not in the past, not ever.</p>
<p>Another practice that isn't science is embracing ignorance. Yet it's
fundamental to the philosophy of intelligent design: I don't know what
this is. I don't know how it works. It's too complicated for me to
figure out. It's too complicated for any human being to figure out. So
it must be the product of a higher intelligence.</p>
