<h1>Robots Eating Jobs</h1>
<p>Barbara Ehrenreich, NYT</p>
<p>[T]he human consequences of robotization are already upon us, and
skillfully chronicled [in the book]. Although the unemployment rate
has fallen to officially acceptable levels, long-term unemployment
persists, and underemployment — part-time jobs when full-time jobs are
needed, or jobs that do not reflect a worker’s education — is on the
rise.  College-educated people often flounder for years after
graduation, finding temp jobs and permanent roommates. Adults of both
sexes are drifting out of the work force in despair. All of this has
happened by choice, though not the choice of the average citizen and
worker. In the wake of the recession, Ford writes, many companies
decided that “ever-advancing information technology” allows them to
operate successfully without rehiring the people they had laid
off. And there should be no doubt that technology is advancing in the
direction of full unemployment. Ford quotes the co-founder of a
start-up dedicated to the automation of gourmet hamburger production:
“Our device isn’t meant to make employees more efficient. It’s meant
to completely obviate them.”</p>
<p>Ford offers little hope that emerging technologies will eventually
generate new forms of employment, in the way that blacksmiths yielded
to autoworkers in the early 20th century. He predicts that new
industries will “rarely, if ever, be highly labor-intensive,” pointing
to companies like YouTube and Instagram, which are characterized by
“tiny workforces and huge valuations and revenues.” On another front,
3-D printing is poised to make a mockery of manufacturing as we knew
it. Truck driving may survive for a while — at least until
self-driving vehicles start rolling out of Detroit or, perhaps, San
Jose [..]</p>
<p>In “Rise of the Robots,” Ford argues that a society based on luxury
consumption by a tiny elite is not economically viable. More to the
point, it is not biologically viable. Humans, unlike robots, need
food, health care and the sense of usefulness often supplied by jobs
or other forms of work. His solution is blindingly obvious: As both
conservatives and liberals have proposed over the years, we need to
institute a guaranteed annual minimum income, which he suggests should
be set at $10,000 a year. This is probably not enough, and of course
no amount of money can compensate for the loss of meaningful
engagement. But as a first step toward a solution, Ford’s may be the
best that the feeble human mind can come up with at the moment.</p>
