<h1>Foreign Aid</h1>
<p>Bruce B. Mesquita <a href="https://oxfordre.com/internationalstudies/internationalstudies/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780190846626.001.0001/acrefore-9780190846626-e-395">paper</a></p>
<p>There is general agreement that foreign aid has been relatively
ineffective in promoting economic growth, improved education or health
care [..]. Debate rages between those who think the problem is that
too little money is spent on aiding the world’s poor (Sachs 2005) and
those who think the money is incorrectly targeted at recipient
governments that too often divert it for corrupt purposes (Easterly
2002; 2006).</p>
<p>There is a third view, which follows from a political economy approach
to aid. [It] suggests that donor governments are not so naive as to
fail to understand that much of their government-to-government aid
will be diverted to the private uses of recipient elites. This view
indicates that foreign aid is used effectively to promote its purpose,
with that purpose being to trade money for policy concessions from
recipient governments [..]. In the view that sees aid-for-policy
deals, we can understand why, for example, the United States gives so
much aid to illiberal regimes. Leaders of such regimes rely on small
coalitions [this is BBMs selectorate theory], who remain loyal to the
incumbent in exchange for private rewards.</p>
<p>Foreign aid provides money for private rewards. It is given by rich
democracies whose incumbents are more likely to be maintained in power
at the margin by obtaining policy concessions from foreign
powers. Autocrats can grant those concessions more easily than can
democrats, making autocrats attractive foreign aid recipients. It
turns out that even the Scandinavian countries disproportionately give
aid to small coalition, petty dictatorships and seemingly acquire
trade concessions in return. Thus, American foreign aid turns out to
look much like foreign aid giving by other well-to-do governments. In
each case, policy concessions are obtained at the lowest price
possible (this may be why foreign aid represents so little
money). Poor autocracies with valuable policy concessions to offer are
most likely to receive aid and, conditional on receiving aid, the more
valuable the policy concession, the richer the recipient, and the
larger the coalition on which the recipient relies, the more total aid
it receives. Thus, countries like Egypt that have granted a major
policy concession – peace with Israel – get a lot of aid while
countries with less valuable policy concessions to offer, as is true
for most of Africa today, receive relatively little aid whether from
the United States, Japan, Scandinavia, or other donors.</p>
<p>While many bemoan America’s foreign aid approach, it is important to
recognize that it represents an equilibrium strategy [a game theoretic
term]. That means that American foreign policy decision makers do not
have an incentive to shift to some other basis for giving aid and
neither do the governments that accept aid from the United States (or
other democratic countries). Four constituencies are affected by
foreign aid policies and three of the four benefit from it. Donor
country constituents – democratic voters – benefit because they gain
policy concessions that they like from recipient regimes (Milner and
Tingley 2006). Leaders in donor countries likewise benefit because the
policy concessions they extract in exchange for aid – whether these
concessions are related to national security, to trade, or to other
policy arenas – make their constituents somewhat more likely to vote
for them. Recipient leaders benefit because they gain money with which
to keep their coalition members loyal, thereby improving their own
political survival prospects.</p>
<p>The big losers generally are the people who reside in the recipient
countries. They lose in two ways from foreign aid. First, their
leaders give up policies that their own people favor. That is why they
can sell the policy concessions. If the people naturally wanted the
policies being conceded then there would be no need for donors to pay
for them. And the people in the recipient countries are saddled with
improved survival prospects for the very leaders who have sold them
out.</p>
<p>Evidence based on an examination of all bilateral foreign aid deals
between prospective (and actual) recipient governments and all donors
who belong to the [OECD] (that is, the world’s wealthy countries)
bears out the contention that aid is better understood as money in
exchange for policy concessions than as money to advance economic,
social, or political development. Indeed, to the extent that foreign
aid can be said to have an impact on political change, it is to
strengthen the hand of dictators and to make regimes likely to become
even more autocratic than would have been true if they did not receive
economic assistance.</p>
<p>The same pattern of reinforcing petty dictators is found following
military interventions by democracies either to shore up an existing
regime or to impose regime change. In either case, democratic
interveners tend to retard the prospects of democratic change, just as
is true with foreign aid giving [..] As a statistical matter, this is
true whether the intervener is the French government, [..], some other
democracy, or the United States, after controlling for selection
effects regarding how difficult the target of intervention is. As with
foreign aid receipts, democratization is retarded, not advanced, by
the foreign policy choices of democracies and the principles governing
that retardation of democratization apply across democracies rather
than being peculiar to the United States.</p>
