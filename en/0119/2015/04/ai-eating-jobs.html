<h1>Robotics Eating Jobs</h1>
<p>Link</p>
<p>2011 [Masterchef] winner Tim Anderson has spent the last two years
helping to devise the ultimate kitchen gadget – a pair of robotic arms
which can whip up any meal with the skill and flair of a professional
chef.</p>
<p>Although it is currently just a prototype which uses the hob,
developers Moley Robotics are planning commercial versions which will
link up to the fridge, oven and even the dishwasher, so it can clean
up afterwards.</p>
<p>To create the device Anderson was filmed in 3D stirring liquids,
chopping vegetables even controlling the temperature of the hob.</p>
<p>His actions were then translated into digital movement using
algorithms created with the help of Stanford University.</p>
<p>The robot not only cooks like Anderson, but it signs off its work with
an ok gesture, just like the chef. It can even make a crab bisque.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I didn’t think this was possible,” said Anderson who
has worked at Le Gavroche and the Fat Duck and owns his own pop-up
restaurant Nanban in London. “I chose crab bisque as a dish because
it’s a real challenge for human chef to make well, never mind a
machine.</p>
<p>“Having seen – and tasted – the results for myself, I am stunned. This
is the beginning of something really significant: a whole new
opportunity for producing good food and for peopleto explore the
world’s cuisines. It’s very exciting.” [..]</p>
<p>The prototype has been 18 years in development and is currently on
show at the world’s biggest robotics show, Hanover Messe.</p>
<p>Moley Robotics, which is headquartered in the UK, is now working to
scale the technology ready for mass production and installation in
regular sized kitchens and want to create an iTunes style recipe book
where dishes can be downloaded for the robot hands to cook [..]</p>
<p>The mass-market product will be supported by a digital library of over
2000 dishes when it launches in 2017 and they hope that celebrity
chefs will embrace 3D cooking downloads [..].</p>
<p>Home chefs will also be able to upload their favourite recipes too
[..].</p>
<p>“Whether you love food and want to explore different cuisines, or
fancy saving a favourite family recipe for everyone to enjoy for years
to come, the Automated Kitchen can do this,” he said.</p>
