<h1>God</h1>
<p>Is there a creator? </p>
<p>Let $F$ be the event something appears organized, and $G$ that there is
a creator. Goal is trying to prove the probability $P(G|F) &gt; P(~G|F)$;
the tilde sign means "not", the negation of the event, the | sign
means "given", i.e. $P(A|B)$ is probability of A given B, that is,
assuming B happened, what's the likelihood of A. Using the Bayes
Theorem,</p>
<p>$$
P(G|F) = P(F|G)P(G) / P(F)
$$</p>
<p>$$
P(~G|F) = P(F|~G)P(~G) / P(F)
$$</p>
<p>Geeks can notice the trick there; we flipped the probabilities, so we
could start from something we know. Everyone agrees $P(F|G) &gt; P(F|~G)$,
that is, "given" there is a creator, the probability
something appears organized is more likely, than given not. As for the
rest, we must take $P(G) = P(~G)$ because that is apriori belief,
believing something from get-go.  If $P(G)$ is not equal to $P(~G)$
you are a bigot.</p>
<p>Well, then $P(F)$ is the same on both equations, $P(G)$ equals to
$P(~G)$, with all else being equal and since $P(F|G) &gt; P(F|~G)$, then
we must conclude $P(G|F) &gt; P(~G|F)$.</p>
<p>But I also accept there is also a form of courage in the way atheists
say "I don't know for sure, and I will remain in this non-knowing
state until I do know for sure". This can be commendable. We've only
shown the probability is higher for one case than not, noone can show
existence of God anything with probability 1 (100% confidence).</p>
