<h1>What if we had voted "YES"?</h1>
<p>Now that a cycle has run its course and it feels like a whole century
has passed since the Sunday of the referendum, I dare ask the
sacrilegious question: What would have possibly happened had we voted
"YES"? The reality would have barely been any different. On Monday the
banks would have been closed. The economy would be melting
rapidly. Retirees would melt in queues under the sun. The country and
its banks would still need a loan of colossal proportions to remain
alive. And the terms for its disbursement would still be tough.</p>
<p>But while the reality wouldn't have changed, the political climate
would definitely be different, even if it is impossible to guess
how. Perhaps Antonis Samaras wouldn't have quit, poor Varoufakis may
have not given his exit papers, the meeting of heads probably wouldn't
have happened, the almost unanimous approval of the parliament to
negotiate would not have been given. And it would definitely have been
harder to politically adjust to this violent crash of reality that
Alexis Tsipras so traumatically experienced in Brussels and so
honestly described in his interview with Greek Radio-Television and
his speech to the Parliament. Because while the shock of colliding
with reality would have been just as violent, as he lived it (and as
we lived it), there would be many that would say to us: "See what you
get for voting 'yes', despondent, fearful fellow citizens? Had you
voted 'no', none of this would have happened, the Europeans would have
fearfully collapsed in front of our feet and offered us the most
excellent agreement, with rivers of money, without terms, without
memorandums."</p>
<p>And we would have believed them. Or we would have been consumed by
doubt.</p>
<p>Thankfully "NO" won. Call it "the wisdom of the masses," call it "an
irony of history" or call it application of the iron law of unintended
consequences that usually pervades in the actions of political
protagonists. But that "NO" helped write the end of an era of
illusion.</p>
<p>The illusion that Grexit was a bluff, a terrifying device of
memorandum propaganda. Until the prime minister found it on his desk,
printed on an official Eurogroup document.</p>
<p>The illusion that we have alternative solutions. Until the prime
minister discovered that in action the only alternatives were
disorderly, catastrophic bankruptcy or 'the Sch√§uble alternative':
Orderly bankruptcy and an assisted exit from the euro, which would
make Greece a nation doubly subordinate to the lenders of the country,
since their loans (and hence their even tougher memorandums) would be
needed to survive and, moreover, would have it be expelled from all
their clubs. It would be a country with heavier obligations, but
without any rights.</p>
<p>The illusion that the country's bankruptcy had not taken place, that
there are hidden funds somewhere, riches, treasures, hydrocarbons,
which the "traitors" hide from the people to facilitate allegiance to
foreigners. The latest version of this beautiful myth: The idea of
"drachma supporters" having invaded the reserves of the Bank of Greece
is so self-evidently ludicrous that it finally ridiculed the whole
mythological structure [..].</p>
<p>The economic price was heavy, the political price deeply traumatic,
but the result can be liberating. A late onset adulthood. Into which,
let even his sworn enemies admit it, Alexis Tsipras could lead
us. Because, of those illusions of ours, no one could free us but
someone who genuinely shared in them, since, as Marx wrote, no one can
create a massive illusion if he himself is not the first victim of
it. There remains, of course, the question if it is he who could lead
a country traumatically freed of its illusions fully to the catharsis
of this drama: overcoming the crisis itself. But that remains to be
seen.</p>
