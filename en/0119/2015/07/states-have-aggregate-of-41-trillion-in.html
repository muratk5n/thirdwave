<h1>States Have an Aggregate of $4.1 Trillion in Unfunded Pension Liabilities</h1>
<p>State Budget Solutions (SBS) has released a comprehensive review of
state-level public employee pension plans in all 50 states and their
funding levels.  Based on annual financial reports and actuarial
valuations, the SBS examined “over 250 state-level defined benefit
pension plans” with a combined $2.6 trillion in assets and evaluated
their funding level based on a “fair-market valuation.” SBS determined
that state-level public pension plans have a $4.1 trillion unfunded
liability, nearly four times as large as the $1 trillion that pension
systems officially report [..]</p>
<p>The rising costs to taxpayers and the smoke-and-mirrors accounting
practices that obscure the realities that pension systems are
operating with threaten the long-term stability of government and, by
extension, pensions. Taxpayers are being mislead as to the true cost
of the tab they’ll be expected to pickup, and public employees are
being sold retirement schemes that may not be around for them when it
is there time to retire. Or even worse, governments and related
pension systems may just go bankrupt and hurt everyone involved.</p>
