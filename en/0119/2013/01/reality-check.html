<h1>Reality Check</h1>
<p>There is such a great gap between what we assume that the  students
know and can understand, and what they actually know  and are able to
understand. When we teach calculus for example,  we take it for
granted that they know high-school algebra and  precalculus inside
out. True, in order to enroll in Calc2, they were supposed to know
Calc1, which means that that they were  supposed to know precalculus
etc. But they don't! Even those that get an A have a very shaky
understanding of very basic high-school algebra (that is much more
important than calculus). 95 percent of even the A students get an A
because they do the symbol-manipulations correctly, and know how to
reproduce the solutions in the review problems. Those who are B and C
students, are not as good fakers. This is like the Turing Test, have a
calculus student simulate understanding, but very few actually
understand what is going on.</p>
<p>And why should they? Calculus, and even high-school algebra, are very
abstract. For the prof., and even TA, it is all ``obvious'', so most
of the instructors can't even understand how it is "not possible to
understand". The few professors [who are ] aware of students'
lack-of-understanding [..] are still bound by the demanding, largely
obsolete, curriculum, teaching students to do, mostly by rote, things
that computer algebra systems can do so much better today.</p>
