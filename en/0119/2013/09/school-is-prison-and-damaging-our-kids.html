<h1>School is a prison — and damaging our kids</h1>
<p>Parents send their children to school with the best of intentions, 
believing that’s what they need to become productive and happy adults. 
Many have qualms about how well schools are performing, but the 
conventional wisdom is that these issues can be resolved with more 
money, better teachers, more challenging curricula and/or more rigorous 
tests.</p>
<p>But what if the real problem is school itself? The 
unfortunate fact is that one of our most cherished institutions is, by 
its very nature, failing our children and our society.</p>
<p>School is a place where children are compelled to be, and 
where their freedom is greatly restricted — far more restricted than 
most adults would tolerate in their workplaces. In recent decades, we 
have been compelling our children to spend ever more time in this kind 
of setting, and there is strong evidence (summarized in my recent book) 
that this is causing serious psychological damage to many of them. 
Moreover, the more scientists have learned about how children naturally 
learn, the more we have come to realize that children learn most deeply 
and fully, and with greatest enthusiasm, in conditions that are almost 
opposite to those of school.</p>
