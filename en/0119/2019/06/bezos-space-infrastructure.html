<h1>Infrastructure for Space, Bezos</h1>
<p>Good talk by Bezos. To get to space we need to build infrastructure;
our generation's work.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQ98hGUe6FM"><img alt="" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/GQ98hGUe6FM/0.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>He mentioned O'Neill stations, living environments with artificial
gravity. with a million ppl per, a thousand of these things could
house a billion. They could be placed at any sufficiently close
distances to Earth, it'll work.</p>
<p>Liquid hydrogen is mentioned; truly the energy storage mechanism of
the future. It is good for rockets, it is good for heating,
electricity, anything we can think of. Basically any place we humans
are interested in will have water anyway, with electrolysis we can
turn that water into fuel, using solar panels.</p>
<p>So we are not leaving Earth, simply stepping outside it for more
options, and even, for a little exercise. It's good to get used to
being in space, with bigger and bigger steps each time. Also these
stations will be Earth-like, not too far from Earth, best of both
worlds so to speak. Killer asteroid? Covered! Even with Earth gone a
few of these things would probably make it.</p>
<p>Blue Origin rockets, built for reuse, and the moon, a perfect
playground, is suitable for the task. It all seems to line up with WH
return-to-moon announcement, that'll work for their favor. </p>

<h2>Energy</h2>
<p>The 10,000 Watts / person is probably from <em>Seeding the Universe with
Life</em> By Michael Noah Mautner. But fine, let's take that as is,</p>
<pre><code class="python">wattperPerson = 10000
pop = 7.79*1e9
print (wattperPerson * pop / 1e12, 'Terrawatts')
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">77.9 Terrawatts
</code></pre>

<p>will be needed for everyone. How much does the Sun supply?</p>
<p><a href="https://ag.tennessee.edu/solar/Pages/What%20Is%20Solar%20Energy/Sun's%20Energy.aspx">Link</a></p>
<p>"At the upper reaches of our atmosphere, the energy density of solar
radiation is approximately 1368 W/m2 (watts per square meter).  At the
Earth's surface, the energy density is reduced to approximately 1000
W/m2".</p>
<pre><code class="python">texasArea = 700000 * 1e6 # meter square
sun = 1000 # Watts per meter square
eff = 0.25 # panel efficiency
daylight = 0.25 # sunlight per day
print (sun*texasArea*eff*daylight / 1e12, 'Terrawatts')
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">43.75 Terrawatts
</code></pre>

<p>If we take today's consumption, which is 157,481 Terrawatt Hours per year,</p>
<pre><code class="python">print (&quot;%0.2f TW&quot; % (157481. / (365*24)))
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">17.98 TW
</code></pre>

<p>Hence panels covering a Texas size area can supply more than the
energy needed today.</p>
<p>Important point 10 KW / person is a first-world number. Not everyone
in the world is there yet. Plus first world is in luxurious
consumption mode, w lots of waste. Imagine how much energy is wasted
in commuting. People travel distances daily that would be unthinkable
to our ancestors &lt;100 years ago, which isn't necessarily advance. It
is waste.</p>
<p>Going to space to get that 1368 W/m2, from 1000 W/m2 is
overkill. World population will double in 70 years with 1% annual
population growth.  Until then, and for a long time, we can just
increase panel area. Sure leave Earth collect energy in their own
solar panel area outside Earth is fine. But the real selling point is
escaping extinction level event rather than "Earth running out of energy". </p>
<p>Also there is such a thing as carrying capacity; in population models
this number is the threshold beyond which more life cannot be
supported, and there is no harm in that. This self-regulation
mechanism runs on its own, we don't have to lose our minds thinking
about it.</p>
