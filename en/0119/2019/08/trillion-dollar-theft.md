# 1.8 Trillion $ Theft

1.8 trillion $'s is being transferred to top %1, annually. My reading
of this situation; this is theft, in broad daylight. Mark Blyth in the
video below will explain where the 1.8 trillion $ number comes from.

"Blyth: [Paraphr] The roughly 10% difference in labor's share of

The split between productivity increases and wage increases since 1973
can also be seen as a form of transfer, as productivity increases flow
to capital, not benefiting worker's earnings.
