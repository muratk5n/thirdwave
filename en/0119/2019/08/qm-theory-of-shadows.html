<h1>Quantum Theory as a Theory of Shadows</h1>
<p>It seems like Cop QM people developed "a theory of shadows". What do I
mean by that? Let's imagine for a moment weird dimensional aliens
discover us from afar, and start observing us with a telescope. But
let's also imagine that all they can see is our shadows, nothing else,
and they have no concept of 3D people, etc.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="shadows.jpeg" /></p>
<p>If you wanted to model people based on this data, you could model
movement perhaps, the base of the shadow moves like a person after
all, but anything about shape, orientation would be grossly
distorted. Shadows can grow while walking depending on the position of
the light, I can imagine an alien scientist going "these people can
change shape while moving!", going agog the way we are shocked
thinking an electron goes through both slits in a double-slit
experiment. If they saw someone's shadow <a href="https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2019/08/shadowwall.jpg">on a
wall</a>,
they'd be like "they can bend themselves to an amazing degree!".  Or
they see football players on the field who can "multiply themselves"
(due to powerful light coming from many different directions). </p>
<p>This is IMO what orthodox quantum mechanics is doing right now. They
modeled the data exactly, as they saw it, and in so doing, developed a
theory of shadows. The mechanism behind those shadows are yet to be
discovered.</p>
