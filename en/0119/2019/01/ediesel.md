# E-Diesel

They also call it *blue crude*. A company named Sunfire can generate a
synthetic crude using renewable sources which can be used in existing
diesel engines.

[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-diesel): "E-diesel is the
name of synthetic diesel created by Audi to be used in
automobiles. Currently, an e-diesel variant is created by Audi
research facility in partnership with a company named Sunfire. The
fuel is created from carbon dioxide, water, and electricity with a
process powered by renewable energy sources to create a liquid energy
carrier called blue crude (in contrast to regular crude oil) which is
then refined to generate e-diesel. E-diesel is considered to be a
carbon-neutral fuel as it does not extract new carbon and the energy
sources to drive the process are from carbon-neutral sources"

There is some buzz around Sunfire. They pulled in new money for
investment, it was in the
[news](https://fuelcellsworks.com/news/paul-wurth-becomes-new-lead-investor-in-sunfire-with-25m-for-green-hydrogen).

Investing in (the right) clean tech can be quite profitable.

A portfolio consisting of tickers I could pull based on the list
above, `BLDP`, `ITM`, `PLUG`, `HYG`, `FCEL`, `SAND`, `HYSR` would have
generated over 30% return for the year 2018.
