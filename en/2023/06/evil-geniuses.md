The specific policy changes in the 1980s were profound in the
aggregate, but beyond the nostalgic Reaganite Morning in America and
freer-free-markets messaging, most of the changes were complicated and
esoteric and seemed small, so they had a stealth quality. It didn’t
feel quite like a paradigm shift because it was mainly carried out by
means of a thousand wonky adjustments to government rules and laws,
and obscure financial inventions, and big companies one by one
changing how they operated and getting away with it—all of it with
impacts that emerged gradually, over decades.  Social Security and
Medicare benefits were not cut, the EPA wasn’t abolished, labor unions
weren’t banned. As it turned out, the 1980s were the ’30s but in
reverse: instead of a fast-acting New Deal, a time-release Raw Deal.

But the reengineering was helped along because the masterminds of the
economic right brilliantly used the madly proliferating nostalgia. By
dressing up their mean new rich-get-richer system in old-time
patriotic drag. By portraying low taxes on the rich and unregulated
business and weak unions and a weak federal government as the only
ways back to some kind of rugged, frontiersy, stronger, better
America. And by choosing as their front man a winsome 1950s actor in a
cowboy hat, the very embodiment of a certain flavor of American
nostalgia.

Government

Every two or four years, a gold-standard academic survey asks
Americans if they “trust the government in Washington to do what is
right just about always, most of the time, or only some of the time?”
In 1964, 77 percent of them said always or most of the time. By 1970
that majority had shrunk to 54 percent, where it remained for a couple
of surveys. But the Vietnam War continued, and we continued losing
it...  Once a large majority of Americans came to believe that the
federal government was uninspiring or incompetent or corrupt or evil,
as they rapidly had over the previous decade, it was going to be a lot
easier for the economic right to persuade people that regulating big
business and taxing the rich were just plain wrong. Those people
wouldn’t necessarily become crusaders for free enterprise, but if they
started focusing more of their resentment and anger on the federal
government, the smart right-wingers knew, it could have the same
effect.
