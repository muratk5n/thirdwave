# Asimov on Israel

It's Been A Good Life, 2002

I am not impressed by ancestry, since if I could trace my origins to
Judas Maccabeus or to King David, that would not add one inch to my
stature, either physically, mentally, or ethically. It's even possible
that my ancestry might not move in the direction of ancient Israel at
all.  About 600 C.E... the Khazars, lived in what is now southern
Russia. They established an empire that reached its peak about 750
C.E., [and] about that time, the Khazars adopted Judaism as the state
religion, [probably] to keep from falling under the influence of
either the Byzantine Christians or the Arab Moslems, who were busily
engaged in the first part of their centuries-long duel.
