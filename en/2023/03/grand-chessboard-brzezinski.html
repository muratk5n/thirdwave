<h1>The Grand Chessboard</h1>
<p>Brzezinski, 1997</p>
<p>The last decade of the twentieth century has witnessed a tectonic
shift in world affairs. For the first time ever, a non-Eurasian power
has emerged not only as the key arbiter of Eurasian power relations
but also as the world's paramount power.</p>
<p>Eurasia, however, retains its geopolitical importance. Not only is its
western periphery—Europe—still the location of much of the world's
political and economic power, but its eastern region— Asia—has lately
become a vital center of economic growth and rising political
influence. Hence, the issue of how a globally engaged America copes
with the complex Eurasian power relationships— and particularly
whether it prevents the emergence of a dominant and antagonistic
Eurasian power—remains central to America's capacity to exercise
global primacy...</p>
<p>American foreign policy.. must employ its influence in Eurasia in a
manner that creates a stable continental equilibrium, with the United
States as the political arbiter...</p>
<p>Eurasia is thus the chessboard on which the struggle for global
primacy continues to be played.. It is noteworthy that as recently as
1940 two aspirants to global power, Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin,
agreed explicitly (in the secret negotiations of November of that
year) that America should be excluded from Eurasia... Each shared the
assumption that Eurasia is the center of the world and that he who
controls Eurasia controls the world.</p>
