# How to Science

Let's say a mechanism to compute the area of a circle (given its
radius) is needed. Do we throw bunch of "data" of radius/area pairs to
a parrot learner and hope it spits back something approaching real
answer?  No.

Here is what you do; mentally take out a piece of the circle,

[Figure 1](../../mbl/2023/infp1.jpg)

.. and other pieces like that, flip every other one place them side by
side

[Figure 2](../../mbl/2023/infp2.jpg)

Again, mental exercise, we think 'if I made the pieces smaller does
that *approach* a known calculation?' Yes it does,

[Figure 3](../../mbl/2023/infp3.jpg)

It approaches the area of a rectangle. We already know how to compute
that, height times width, $C/2 r$, $C$ is circumference, $C = 2 \pi
r$, area is $\pi r^2$. Boom.

We just used mental transformations (in complex problems the algebra
is more complex but still symbolic) to reach something simpler. That
final formula is the end-result, the fruit of science. The end-result
is fast to compute, and accurate. Simple manipulation w algebra,
geometry saved me from countless computations. This is how science is
done, through representations, mental transformations.
