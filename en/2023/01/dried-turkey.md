# Dried Turkey Patties

Ingredients

* 1 kg Turkey (or Chicken) Meat
* 1 Teaspoon Turmeric
* 1 Teaspoon Garam Masala
* 1 Onion (Sliced)
* Â½ Cup Yoghurt 

Cut meat into chunks and place in glass dish, with onion slices on
top, cook in oven at 200 C for 1/2 hours or until meat is well done
while throwing away the juices that come out occasionally.

Once cooked transfer to a bowl, sprinkle the turmeric, masala, yogurt,
and blend. A hand-held blender works well. Form small, long, thin,
flat patties, put pieces back in the oven now on the grill part, leave
there at 80 C degrees, for 5 hours. That's it.

Ideas for Meal - mix dried beet roots, apples, cheese (with sufficient
fat) plus dried soup (Greek trahana [1]), hot water, boom.  Just
created a camp stew.

Beet root, chards, apples work well, for any day, don't want anything
that is too citric (oranges) or too high on potassium even though it
has great eyesight benefits (carrots), or too high in iron (spinach
instead of chards). Too much potassium will create sleepiness, too
much iron is as harmful almost as much as too little.

Drying the blended / ground raw meat is key, idea from here [3],
instead of pieces from the whole turkey breast, bcz with latter
approach end-product hardens too much, becomes difficult to mix in a
stew, or chew on seperately if necessary. The approach here [2] dries
meat chunks and powders the end-result later, that's possible for
those with heavy-duty mixer available.
