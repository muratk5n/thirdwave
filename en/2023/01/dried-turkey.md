# Dried Turkey Patties

Ingredients

* 1 kg Turkey (or Chicken) Meat
* 1 Teaspoon Turmeric
* 1 Teaspoon Garam Masala
* 1 Onion (Sliced)
* Â½ Cup Yoghurt 

Cut meat into chunks and place in dish, with onion slices on top, cook
in oven at 200 C for 1/2 hours or until meat is well done while
throwing away the juices. Once cooked transfer to a bowl, sprinkle the
turmeric, masala, yogurt, and blend. A hand-held blender works
well. Form small, long, thin, flat patties, dehydrate at 80 C degrees,
for 5 hours. Done.

Ideas for Meal - mix small pieces of patty, dried vegs (I use beet
roots, apples) and low-salt cheese (with sufficient fat) plus dried
soup (Greek trahana [1]), hot water, boom.  Just created a stew.

Drying the blended / ground raw meat patty is key [3], instead of
pieces from the whole raw poultry, bcz with latter approach
end-product becomes difficult to mix in a stew, or to chew on. The
approach here [2] powders dried pieces, that's fine for those with
heavy-duty mixer.

* Vegs are dried seperately on a dehydrator at 50C for >8 hours
(optimal temp to keep vitamins in).

* Pre-cook / blend step was added when ground raw meat is not
available, usually for poultry it won't be. If it is, steps as in [3]
will work.
