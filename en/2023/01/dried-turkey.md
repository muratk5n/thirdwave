# Dried Turkey 

Ingredients

* 1 kg Turkey (or Chicken) Meat
* 1 Bunch Swiss chards
* 1 Teaspoon Turmeric
* 1 Teaspoon Garam Masala

Cut meat into chunks and place in dish, sprinkle the turmeric, masala
on top. Put in oven at 200 C for 1/2 hours or until meat is well done,
throw away any fat, water that comes out. Transfer to a bowl, add
chards and blend (adding veg raw eases the blending process, through
their water). A hand-held blender works well. This is our veg + poultry
mixture. Form small poultry balls, place into the drier, dry
at 55 C degrees, for 7-8 hours. That's all.

Drier creates a hardened exterior on the outside of the poultry
pieces, which IMO helps the food last longer (also eases handling).

Ideas for Meal: can also buy or dry beet roots, apples.. For a meal
toss all these in a cup, add cheese, plus some dried soup (Greek
trahana works best), and boiling water, boom. The water rehydrates
everything, makes for great camping food. The fat comes from the
cheese, the rest is already in the dried ingredients. Most cheese will
last outdoors for a while, there are some dry ones, if not, tallow, or
olive oil are always options.

Beet root, chards, apples were chosen after much trial and error. We
dont want anything that is too citric (oranges) or too high on potassium
even though it has great eyesight benefits (carrots), or too high in
iron (spinach instead of chards). Too much potassium will create sleepiness,
too much iron is as harmful almost as much as too little.
