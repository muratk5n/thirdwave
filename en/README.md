Near endpoints generating electricity is fine.. Long-distance energy
transmission however must be gas-based. I would even pipe clean gas
into homes at that point power can be generated from fuel-cells. One
step earlier, fine again, neighborhood fuel-cell "transformer" could
generate power for the neighborhood and supply the local "grid". But
inter-city grid, inter-state grid, inter-anything grid is a no-no.  At
those points it should be about *de-funding the grid*.

There is some freak stuff coming out of Sweden.. Is there a hidden

Eyes-wide-shut type of stuff, under the mountain, in the abandoned
bunker, you know what I'm talking about.. Suspicious.

Stanpoli visitors probably noticed stray dogs there - foxes are better
but stray animals are not good, not for the citizens nor for the
animal.

---

"While foxes have been around in [London] since the end of the First
World War, their numbers have boomed in the past three decades. The
expanding sprawl of the city ‚Äî offering foxes free accommodation and
leftover takeaways ‚Äî can help explain these increases. The London
Wildlife Trust estimates that there are 10,000 foxes in the city"
