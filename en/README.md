Unusual Whales: "2022 Congressional Stock Trading Report.. By
analysing publicly accessible financial disclosures, we found that a
quarter of Congress actively traded up to $788M in various assets
through 12,700+ transactions in 2022... Congress beat SPY based on
total returns in 2022, as well as a secondary way of calculating based
on if they traded SPY instead of the stocks they traded"

Theather's revenue needs to come out of the gross not be a multiple of
the budget.  *The Joker* had a budget of abt 70 mil..?  Did the
theathers say "oh we'll take pity on this tiny little movie, give you
a pass, charge you less"? No. That's not how it works.  The more a
movie makes, the more a theather makes - no matter the budget.

---

I don't think the 'multiply budget with two' trick is a sound
estimation approach for marketing + distribution. 

---

Example *Toy Story 4*, grossed 1.13 bil, cost 200 mil. Using 40% of
the gross, half of budget for (good) marketing,

```python
gross = 1130
budget = 200
marketing = budget/2
print (gross - (marketing + budget + gross*0.40), 'mil')
```

```text
378.0 mil
```

This movie's profit was $368 million. Close.

I'd say roughly 40% of the gross is for dist, and half the budget for
marketing

"Opening weekend the theater makes between 10 to 20 percent of ticket
sales. Week 2 15 to 30 percent. And so on till it's a 50 50 split
after about 4 to 5 week"

How to calculate the profit of a movie? They are not published
immediately, but with known budget, box office gross we could estimate
a total cost (including marketing, distribution).

"Where Did the Long Tail Go?.. Back in 2006, [Chris] Anderson
predicted the End of the Blockbuster — but what has happened since
then?..  the Long Tail is a cruel joke. It’s a fairy tale we’re told
to make us feel good about all those marginalized creative
endeavors. Their happily-ever-after day will come—or so we are
promised—because the Long Tail will rescue them"

"[I]t is fundamental research—investigations whose findings don't seem
to be immediately useful—that suffer first when technological
development slows. Today those areas are clearly cosmology and
particle or high-energy physics—where the link between science and
technology, theory and human progress, has been broken as in
postclassical Greece, the stagnation of society has led to the return
of mathematical myths, a retreat from the problems of base matter to
the serene contemplation of numbers."

"Big Bang supposedly occurred only about twenty billion years ago,
nothing in the cosmos can be older than this. Yet in 1986 astronomers
discovered that galaxies compose huge agglomerations a billion
light-years across; such mammoth clusterings of matter must have taken
a hundred billion years to form."

Hard crime is the type where if arrested you can find yourself in a
plane sitting next to Danny Trejo, Steve Buschemi, John Malkovich and
after a scuffle JM is like 'I have the only gun on board', everybody
is screwed.
