ROCKED IT

H2 Central: "NamX Rocks the Paris Motor Show With a Hydrogen Powered
SUV Concept Using Removable Tanks"

"@nelhydrogen

We've broken our order size record, for the second time in four
months! We have entered into a contract for alkaline electrolyser
equipment from Australian company @WoodsideEnergy - the contract has a
total value of about [$57 million]"

NYT: "Speaker Nancy Pelosi could be succeeded by Representative Kevin
McCarthy of California if Republicans take control of the House"

---

"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.. is signaling that if
Republicans win the House majority in next month’s midterm elections,
the GOP is likely to oppose more aid to Ukraine in its war with
Russia."

H2 Central: "[University of New South Wales] Engineers retrofit diesel
engine for clean hydrogen combustion.. The scientists claim to have
used the H2 in a dual-fuel injection system and boosted efficiency 26
percent"

BTW per Mission Barns [share](2022/06/lab-grown-meat.html#missionbarns) earlier, 
cultivated meat with a "cut" was mentioned; Too luxurious.. For survival
cultivated protein "kibbles", or just powder is enough, add fat, some
fruits, the picture is complete, ala pemmican.

Arab News: “[Macron said] 'In a spirit of great friendship, we will
say to our American and Norwegian friends: You’re super, you supply us
with energy and gas, but one thing that can’t go on for too long is us
paying four times more than the price you sell to your industry.. That
is not exactly the meaning of friendship'"

Ruski Brewski. That's a good name for a bar, or microbrewery

---

Fuckin Ruski. Will their tech save the climate now?

---

Can generate lots of H2 with that kind of power.. Near imitless clean
fuel from RU. China can supply the electrolyzers.  Boom. Pipe it
anywhere.

---

Finland has some waste storage afaik.. France, US probably have them
too. 

---

And everyone gave their spent fuel to Russia? Now they can be the
biggest supplier on that too [facepalm].

First Post: "[W]e are talking about the..  reactor being completely
switched to uranium-plutonium MOX fuel. That reactor is standing at
the Beloyarsk nuclear power station, placed in the Urals mountains at
the border between Europe and Asia. The switch took several years, but
now the totally revolutionary reactor is giving power to consumers.

And that, my friends, means that Russia has achieved a closed circuit
of getting nuclear energy, asking for no raw materials like uranium
(or oil, or gas). That reactor works on the old stocks of spent
nuclear fuel, which is not just abundant, it will last us for several
thousand years. Oh, and in the future, there will be no such thing as
spent fuel, in need of stocking in some remote places. Every scrap of
it will be reprocessed..

Russia has been paid heavily by many nuclear powers to stock that
spent fuel, so now we have plenty"

This reactor works on spent nuclear fuel BTW, the toxic waste from
used uranium. That waste used to cause storage problems right? This
new tech will be able to reuse it. Two birds with one stone.

World Nuclear News: "[Russian] Beloyarsk nuclear power plant.. resumed
operations after being fully loaded with uranium-plutonium mixed oxide
(MOX) fuel"

"@HydrogenCouncil

Belgium's Hydrogen Strategy 2.0 is out laying a bold vision for the
country as a #H2Hub and putting forward a whole-system approach to
\#hydrogen deployment"

---

He basically said don't rely on us to replace Russian gas

FT: "[The head of Qatar's state gas company] warned that he could not
envisage a future where 'zero Russian gas' flowed to Europe"
