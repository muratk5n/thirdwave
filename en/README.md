SNAM is one of the world's largest infrastructure companies. Here is
its CEO [on CNBC](https://youtu.be/sZlHFKaKJU0?t=273), talking about
reusing existing pipelines for H2 transport. It works.

He says he was mistakenly cast.. How the hell does that happen?
There was an another actor with same name?

With renewable fuels, the possibility is also wide open for a green

ZeroAvia CEO was on F24, great interview. He used the word 'hydrogen
electric' a lot. Good idea, for marketing.. The "e-word" is associated
with all kinds of 'good things for climate' in people's minds it makes
sense to ride that marketing wave. Technically the use is correct, a
fuel-cell converts H2 into electricity so the whole system *is*
hydrogen-electric. There are BEVs, there are FCEVs -- both are EVs.

But decision makers need to understand what's going on under the hood,
the overall system, in terms of emphasis (and dollars). With H2
electric, electricity comes in to the picture *dead last*, right
before it is used. Until that point the entire production, transport,
storage can remain in gas / liquid / molecules -- no electricity
needed.

2003 was year of Iraq invasion, and, I just looked, the year of that
Britney Spears video *Toxic*. How things change.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
