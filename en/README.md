Col Douglas Macgregor: "Moscow‚Äôs determination to destroy Ukrainian
forces at the least cost to Russian lives prevailed. Ukrainian
casualties were always heavier than reported from the moment Russian
troops crossed into Eastern Ukraine, but now, thanks to the recent
failure of Ukrainian counterattacks in the Kherson region, they‚Äôve
reached horrific levels that are impossible to conceal...

The recent Ukrainian advance to the town of Izium, the link between
Donbas and Kharkiv, seemed like a gift to Kiev. U.S. satellite arrays
undoubtedly provided Ukrainians with a real-time picture of the area
showing that Russian forces west of Izium numbered less than 2,000
light troops (the equivalent of paramilitary police, e.g., SWAT and
airborne infantry).

The Russian command opted to withdraw its small force from the area
that is roughly 1 percent of formerly Ukrainian territory currently
under Russian control. However, the price for Kiev‚Äôs propaganda
victory was high‚Äîdepending on the source, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000
Ukrainian troops were killed or wounded in a flat, open area that
Russian artillery, rockets, and air strikes turned into a killing
field...

Given Washington‚Äôs inability to end the war in Ukraine with the defeat
of Russian arms, it seems certain that the Beltway will try instead to
turn the ruins of the Ukrainian state into an open wound in Russia‚Äôs
side that will never heal. From the beginning, the problem with this
approach was that Russia always had the resources to dramatically
escalate the fighting and end the fighting in Ukraine on very harsh
terms. Escalation is now in progress.

Washington always mistook Putin‚Äôs readiness to negotiate and limit the
scope and destructiveness of the campaign in Ukraine as evidence of
weakness, when it was clear that Putin‚Äôs aims were always restricted
to the elimination of the NATO threat to Russia in Eastern Ukraine"
