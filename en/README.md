Food growing, manufacturing, education, how are they delivered? Those
define capabilities, society forms around them. Automated farming,
tablets that can access all classes creates a different world than
bunch of people knee-deep in the mud, hippies or not.

The Guardian: "New Zealand, Iceland, the UK, Tasmania and Ireland are
the places best suited to survive a global collapse of society,
according to a study.

The researchers said human civilisation was 'in a perilous state' due
to the highly interconnected and energy-intensive society that had
developed and the environmental damage this had caused.

To assess which nations would be most resilient to such a collapse,
countries were ranked according to their ability to grow food for
their population, protect their borders from unwanted mass migration,
and maintain an electrical grid and some manufacturing
ability. Islands in temperate regions and mostly with low population
densities came out on top.

The researchers said their study highlighted the factors that nations
must improve to increase resilience. They said that a globalised
society that prized economic efficiency damaged resilience, and that
spare capacity needed to exist in food and other vital sectors...

'We were quite surprised the UK came out strongly.. But it has the
potential to withstand shocks.'"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
