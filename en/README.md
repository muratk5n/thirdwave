Forbes: "This summer, when the first bulldozers rumble across central
Utah and begin excavating brine ponds, the Advanced Clean Energy
Storage hub will be breaking ground in multiple ways.

The construction will create massive underground salt caverns, giving
rise to the largest renewable energy storage facility anywhere in the
world. It also will kick off a new phase of the energy
transition. This unique project – part energy conversion, part
long-duration storage – promises to empower the technological and
infrastructure advances needed to realize hydrogen’s potential in a
net zero carbon future...

In June, the Department of Energy announced a $504 million loan
guarantee for the hub’s first phase, allowing construction to get
underway. As Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm put it, “This is a big
deal for the clean hydrogen space.”

Energynews.biz: "[A] massive pipeline project in eastern Germany that
aims to jumpstart the hydrogen market there by 2027. For the eastern
German hydrogen grid, the GASCADE-Fluxys project calls for
constructing a new 50-kilometer hydrogen pipeline from the Baltic Sea
region around Rostock all the way to the south. Hydrogen production,
storage, and demand will all be connected through this system, making
it a potent node in the hydrogen supply chain"

Noise-canceling tech is a fantastic invention

"Sony’s MX5 headphones use microphones to pick up low-frequency noise
[from outside] before it reaches the ear by playing ambient sound,
effectively canceling out the invasive sounds... the music you’re
listening to is outputted at a lower frequency... less damaging to
your ears than just turning up the volume on your earbuds to make
external noise quieter. These next-level headphones truly mute.. the
volume of the outside world, making a simple walk around the
neighborhood feel like a cinematic experience or focusing while
working from home with loud roommates well, possible"

What does it even mean to 'deserve to be in NATO'?  He is right that
no country would 'bring more to the table,' including an ongoing

of escalatory spiral w/ a nuclear adversary, & it is difficult to
defend.

The Atlantic: "Not too long ago, I heard one of the leading Brexiteers
describe his political philosophy in a room full of CEOs and senior
politicians. He started by talking to this elite group about the great
division between 'elites' and 'the people,' the victors and the
victims of globalization, the haves and the have-nots of
modernity. The longer he spoke, the more his words began to seem rote,
remote, and stale. The energizing slogans of the Brexit campaign of
2016 sounded hollow and clich​​éd in 2022. Partly, this is because the
slogans were not true.

Globalization was indeed bad for some people and good for others, but
those groups didn’t split neatly along a rural-urban or rich-poor
divide, or along any other easily defined demographic line. Some
farmers in the distant countryside turned out to be huge beneficiaries
of Britain’s European Union membership. Some of the least-well-off
Britons benefited from foreign investment.

Besides, many of the people loudly attacking the “elite” were not
actually among globalization’s losers themselves. Boris Johnson was
the standout example of this phenomenon: He attended Eton and
Oxford.. , and his campaign was paid for by hedge-fund managers and
billionaires. More important, Brexit, the solution to the problem
Johnson and his supporters described, was based on a series of
lies. The electorate was promised that departure from the EU would
lead not only to fewer immigrants but to greater prosperity, more
welfare spending, less crowded hospitals. Instead, six years after the
vote, Britain is less prosperous and more unequal. Brexit reduced the
U.K. GDP by at least 1.5 percent even before it took full effect; the
U.K. has the highest inflation rate in the G7; small businesses,
especially importers, have been crushed by Brexit-related red tape and
supply-chain problems. Though committees have been set up to look for
'benefits from Brexit,' few are available"

This gets better and better

The Guardian: "Margaret Thatcher’s infamous 'No, no, no' retort to
Jacques Delors, a historic moment in the UK’s relationship with
Europe, which also had the effect of precipitating her downfall, was
partly inspired by an article penned by a young journalist named Boris
Johnson, her newly released private papers show"
