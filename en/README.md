There's been a Pope who tried to argue Jesus wasn't poor. That was some shit.

Juan Cole: "Life in medieval feudal societies did not encourage
pacific theologies, and Muslims in later empires lost touch with the
realities of the early seventh century. What if we read Jesus‚Äôs life
and thought only through the lens of Pope Urban II, who launched the
sanguinary Crusades in the Holy Land with the cry, ‚ÄúGod wills it!‚Äù?

Below Juan Cole analyzes Israeli culture as an extension of where its
different immigrants came from, rather than an homogenous culture of
transnational religion which stays the same no matter where it is
at. The larger host culture is key. Heritage means little.

ABC News: "A 2018 Justice Department study of state and local law
enforcement training academies found that the average length of core
basic police training in the U.S. is 833 hours, or less than 22
weeks... 

In comparison, police recruits in Japan get between 15 and 21 months
of training. Police in Germany get 2.5 years of training. And in
Finland, police education takes three years to complete..

Many police academies in the U.S. still resemble military boot camps,
with cadets in buzz cuts and hair buns getting yelled at by drill
instructors.

'Barking orders and giving commands and sort of a military kind of
thinking -- it's not a problem-solving approach. It's not critical
thinking,' Wexler said.

Much of the training in American police academies emphasizes skills
like marksmanship and defensive tactics, with less focus on so-called
'soft skills' like communication and crisis intervention"
