"@josheidelson

What is the reason to call, say, Tesla, Amazon, and Instacart 'tech'
companies but not, say, Boeing, AT&T, or the New York Times?"

All this started bcz of previous President's jailing? How bad was the
man's crime? Couldn't they sentence him, then current President
pardons? Nixon got the pardon... Bcz of a need to respect the
insitution of the Presidency, etc.. But at a practical level these ppl
have a lot of supporters.. they get elected by the people! So why
antagonize the supporters?

On the optimality of infrastructural tech choices: If H2 is the energy
carrier, there are many ways to get to it.. Tech will improve those
choices, the process over time will get cheaper and faster. Get H2
through this catalyst, that catalyst, etc. Independent parts can be
researched independently.

With lit batteries, the path, the goal all revolve around on thing:
lithium. No other choice. Now you are stuck; stuck with finite amount
of reserves, stuck with the way batteries are architected, all
stuck. Hallmark of bad engineering; unflexible basis, with a single
point of failure, shoddy architecture the kind that originates from
retarded, shoddy minds.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
