Lavo is a great company, their chief scientist is a true genius. 

H2 Fuel News: "Hydrogen storage systems company LAVO has received a A$5m ($3.4m)
boost to start-up its prototyping, testing and manufacturing facility
as it aims to scale-up production.

The new capital was awarded by the New South Wales (NSW) Government,
through its Regional Job Creation Fund, with LAVO hoping to create 250
new jobs at the site

H2 canisters: have a few canisters to power the house, others as
empties / backups, empty canisters could be refilled in the nearby H2
station. Just like driving to a grocery store, drive to gas station to
get your home some gas. This is massive energy let's not forget,
easily transportable, it's not like inferior tech Li-on
batteries. Once at home, take empty canister out, put the full one in.

Or a service in near future will deliver you full canisters, take old one.

Or nearby municipality will bring gas in form of pipeline. House cld
be built for both.

Here I found the insulating material for ya

"VIPs or Vacuum Insulated Panels are specially designed panels that use
the insulation of a vacuum in a board shape"

---

Company idea: produce H2-ready tiny houses. Ready for H2 pipeline, or
gas canisters (with an option to generate and store on site). Cld be a
profitabe bidness.. They can be shipped, exported even right?

Use some of that VIP, minimal energy for heating.

Hydrogen-ready boiler from [Worchester Bosch](https://www.worcester-bosch.co.uk/hydrogen).
Works on both natgas and green.

---

100% H2 transmission on existing natgas pipeline is possible, I
believe the main issue the end-products; With 20% blending existing
boilers, ovens work as if they are still taking natgas. But if
end-products become ready for green gas soon, or for both nat and
green, then the switch to 100% could be made at an instant.

---

So many colors for H2 production. Green is from renewable, blue is
from fossil plus ccs, gray is from fossil without ccs, pink is from
nuclear.

Klitschko the boxer is the mayor? Good experience... Next up, el

Actually their hesitancy is understandable.. DE has lots of relations with RU.

Politico: "Berlin was ridiculed for sending¬†5,000 protective
helmets¬†to Ukraine rather than weapons ‚Äî prompting Kyiv Mayor Vitali
Klitschko to ask if the next delivery would be of pillows"

---

Thats funny

Politico: "[A previous DE Chancelor] Schr√∂der ‚Äî chairman of Nord
Stream, the Russian-owned, Swiss-based firm that owns pipelines
bringing Russian gas to Europe, and who is a long-time friend of
Vladimir Putin ‚Äî¬†went on to say he hoped ‚Äúthe saber-rattling from
Ukraine will stop"... Schr√∂der was roundly mocked for his comments"

Unless of course there is a bus driver for a President as in f-ing
Venezuella who is printing money and giving it to people creating
hyperinflation.

GDP growth YoY 5.5%. Still making up for pandemic related losses.

[[Data]](2019/05/stats.md#cycle)

Crazy wage growth (prev quarter) 4.6%

[[Data]](2019/05/stats.md#wages)

Wage growth could be contributing to inflation as well, which is, if
we go by the textbook, always the main source of inflation.

---

If China previously exported deflation to the rest of the world and
now they are supposedly being cut off from the world supply
chain.. what wld that do? Cause the reverse of deflation? There is
inflation in many countries right now..

Interesting.. One can feel full after a proper bulgur meal,
sure.. Must be due to those 9 aminos
