H2 Central: "A leading group of German companies along with
Australia‚Äôs Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) has released a green
hydrogen roadmap, outlining a set of recommendations for government
and industry, to meet the ambitious target of importing large amounts
of green hydrogen from Australia to Germany.

The Green Hydrogen Taskforce, created earlier this year, is a
collaborative effort between FFI, and some of the strongest energy,
industrial, and technology companies in¬†Germany, including Covestro,
E.ON, Linde, Luthardt, SAP, Schaeffler, thyssenkrupp Nucera and
thyssenkrupp Uhde"

If m t / y means megaton per year that translates to 10 GW of output.
Good. And we need more. A few more at this scale.

All fossil producers need to generate this stuff.. as much as humanly
possible.

"@H2Standard

The prospects for green hydrogen have been given a boost as a market
landgrab by oil and gas majors continues. June has seen BP and
TotalEnergies buying stakes in projects with a combined production
capacity of 2.6 m t/y"

TDB: "And yet, even with the challenge of pandemic recovery, we are
not facing 'stagflation,' a word that ruled our economic lives 40
years ago and now is a term that I have to explain to my younger
students. Stagflation was something that once seemed impossible: high
inflation, low growth, and high unemployment all at the same
time. This happened in the 1970s, but it isn‚Äôt happening now‚Äîor at
least, it isn‚Äôt happening yet‚Äîand it‚Äôs one reason treating 2022 as if
it‚Äôs 1979 doesn‚Äôt make much sense.Let‚Äôs also admit an obvious
political reality about the expectations of the American voter: Many
of the people who are fed up with inflation in 2022 are angry mostly
because until about a year ago, they‚Äôd never actually experienced
it. Yes, it‚Äôs been a rough year, but in 1979 Americans were despairing
because high inflation had already been around for several
years. Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Carter all tussled with it. We
tried everything from wage and price controls to 'Whip inflation now'
sloganeering‚Äîas if consumers could join the fight by wearing
buttons.The same is true of interest rates. Today‚Äôs younger consumers
may be shocked that mortgages are breaking 6 percent‚Äîbut again, this
is because they have become accustomed to ridiculously low rates. Even
50 years ago, the average rates were about 7 percent; they‚Äôve been
lower than that for two decades now"

US liberterian right there

NYT: "[Peter Thiel interview, 2017] It‚Äôs like, even if you appointed a
whole series of conservative Supreme Court justices, I‚Äôm not sure that
Roe v. Wade would get overturned.. I don‚Äôt know if people even care
about the Supreme Court"

German liberterians supported ending the ban - because of, you know,
liberty.

NYT: "Germany Ends Ban on Abortion Advertisement.. The vote to scrap
the law came on the same day that Roe v. Wade was overturned by the
U.S. Supreme Court.

Lawmakers voted on Friday to end a Nazi-era ban on the advertisement
of abortion services, a measure that had effectively criminalized
doctors who provided information about the procedure.The law, though
ignored for years, had recently prompted several high-profile legal
cases against doctors. That, in turn, led to a sustained campaign by
abortion-rights activists for repeal of the advertising ban, which
Germany‚Äôs relatively new government had made a goal"

Manchin: "I trusted Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh when they
testified under oath that they also believed Roe v. Wade was settled
legal precedent and I am alarmed they chose to reject the stability
the ruling has provided for two generations of Americans."

And now they will say 'vote for us to bring back Roe'; the culture war
dividend never ends.

"@JeffreyStClair3

The leadership of the Democratic Party, which for 20 years has said
the only reason to vote for them is to protect Roe, should resign en
masse. Their failure is absolute"

RU had 10 times more artillery attacks for that day than UKR


```python
import pandas as pd
d = 20220622
df = pd.read_csv('events_latest.csv')
dfr = df[ (df.a_rus_b==1) & (df.date==d) ]
print ("ru artillery:", dfr.t_artillery_b.sum())
dfu = df[ (df.a_ukr_b==1) & (df.date==d) ]
print ("ukr artillery:", dfu.t_artillery_b.sum())
```

```text
ru artillery: 61
ukr artillery: 6
```

Code sifts through RU, UKR media sources, and pulls out relevant info
automagically using "high dimensional ad-hoc nonlinear statistics"
sometimes called machine learning, but these days usually mistakenly
called "AI".

NYT: "Russian Elites Show No Sign of Broad Challenge to Putin"

Washington Examier: "After a month of holding out, the Ukrainian high
command ordered the remaining defenders in Severodonetsk, the
administrative capital of Luhansk, to beat a tactical retreat out of
the city and fortify their defenses in Lysychansk, the sister city to
the west of the Seversky Donets River. 'Remaining in positions smashed
to pieces over many months just for the sake of staying there does not
make sense,' Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said...

Russian forces were making slow progress in the Severodonetsk pocket
for weeks, using their advantage in artillery to pummel everything in
their path before sending ground forces into the area. Russia‚Äôs war
plan, to put it in the most unsophisticated way possible, was to
overwhelm the Ukrainian defenders with constant bombardment until they
relented. For Ukraine, the only other alternative would have been to
stick around and risk total encirclement ‚Äî a strategy that would have
been indefensible, if not insane, when the Ukrainian military is
already losing perhaps 200 soldiers a day"
