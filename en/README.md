It has to be due to the vacuum on top of the airfoil... The shape
blocks flow from getting there directly, which creates briefly (but
repeatedly, due to forward movement) a vacuum meaning lower
pressure. There is higher pressure below, ergo lift. Increase angle of
attack, there is even more pressure below, molecules are directly
hitting airfoil now. At the right angle, in a sweet spot avoiding
stall, you get lift.

Great example of putting capitalism on a leash. Left to their own
devices (!) companies would not converge to the same standard,
everyone, especially established players, would have an incentive to
lock people in to their own charger mechanism. But that leads to
waste.  Capitalism can optimize for certain things, but not
necessarilly for grander goals, eg resource usage, material footprint
on the planet, or even consumer's benefit, in a larger ecosystem. If a
person needs to own three chargers for three devices, that is huge
amount of waste, consumer is not served well either. There is metal in
there that needs to be mined somewhere, plastic that requires fossil
fuels refinery. Governance steps in, tunes the whole thing.
