Energate: "The Bavarian Minister of Economic Affairs.. has now signed
a declaration of intent to this effect with his counterpart.. in
Glasgow. Together they now want to examine possible hydrogen
routes.. "Scotland is a politically stable European partner with a
potential of 25 percent of Europe's offshore wind energy production,"
Aiwanger explained. This means that large quantities of hydrogen can
be produced. Bavaria will have to rely on imports despite the
expansion of renewable energies, he said. The agreement reached also
provides for cooperation in technology development for storage and
transport'

Namibia is on the Atlantic, so if they ship or pipeline the product
it would be toward Portugal or Spain instead of going through
Eastern Africa / Suez I'm guessing.

H2 Central: "The European Union is planning to sign a deal with
Namibia to support the country‚Äôs ‚Äògreen‚Äô hydrogen sector and boost
European imports of the fuel as the bloc works to reduce its
dependence on Russian energy...

In May, the EU‚Äôs energy strategy set a goal of importing at least 10
million tonnes of ‚Äògreen‚Äô hydrogen by 2030, with another 10 million
tonnes to be produced within the bloc.

EU, Namibia tight-lipped on details of the deal. Under the plan, the
European Union will sign a memorandum of understanding with Namibia on
hydrogen and minerals at the UN Climate Conference due to take place
in Egypt in November"

SCOTUS struck down carbon regulation? There can be a
work-around.. Power stations can be charged a high blanket tax for
energy transmission across state lines, and if they want a rebate on
that tax, station has to prove their carbon emission is low. So gov is
not 'regulating' but simply 'checking' if company would be elligeble
for a rebate.

Sure; high inflation can beget higher inflation so time series would
be correlated with itself, ie autocorrelation. That is partly why CB
raises to quash that self-reinforcing effect.

"Inflation is highly autocorrelated"

They are likely paid from taxes, which means existing money, do not
expand the money base. No new inflation.

If new money isn't printed for payments, they won't be
inflationary.

Sadat played for a post-conflict settlement to get Sinai back rather
than through military action itself.. New friends in US would be
necessary for that to work, so he sent the Soviets packing.. Smart
move. See, don't have to win militarily all the time to win something
valueable in military terms. 

History Channel: "Israel‚Äôs stunning victory in the Six-Day War of 1967
left the Jewish nation in control of territory four times its previous
size. Egypt lost the 23,500-square-mile Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza
Strip, Jordan lost the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Syria lost
the strategic Golan Heights. When Anwar el-Sadat (1918-81) became
president of Egypt in 1970, he found himself leader of an economically
troubled nation that could ill afford to continue its endless crusade
against Israel. He wanted to make peace and thereby achieve stability
and recovery of the Sinai, but after Israel‚Äôs 1967 victory it was
unlikely that Israel‚Äôs peace terms would be favorable to Egypt. So
Sadat conceived of a daring plan to attack Israel again, which, even
if unsuccessful, might convince the Israelis that peace with Egypt was
necessary.

In 1972, Sadat expelled 20,000 Soviet advisers from Egypt and opened
new diplomatic channels with Washington, D.C., which, as Israel‚Äôs key
ally, would be an essential mediator in any future peace talks. He
formed a new alliance with Syria, and a concerted attack on Israel was
planned"

They don't have that kind of animosity over there, can't Israel achive
