H2 Central: "Ecopetrol, the largest oil company in Colombia, has
signed the hydrogen company H2B2.. for its green transition... H2B2 is
confident that the hydrogen energy market will be worth $10 billion by
2030, with an increase in electrolyser installations in the coming
years"

H2 Central: "Brazilian chemical maker Unigel said on Wednesday it will
invest up to $1.5 billion in its complex in the state of Bahia to
produce so-called green hydrogen, the first in the country to do so on
an industrial scale...

The plant, located in the city of Camaçari, should have the first of
three phases inaugurated by the end of 2023, expanding capacity until
it achieves production of 100,000 tonnes of hydrogen by 2027, or
600,000 tonnes of one of its derivatives, ammonia"

ARkStorm looks like some serious shit. Read some of the scenarios - dam

"@weatherwest@mastodon.social

The recent storm sequence in California--as damaging, disruptive, and
(sadly) deadly as it was--is still nowhere near the severity level of
plausible events we foresee in the ARkStorm scenarios. The risks are
rising in a warming climate...and we need to prepare"

We could gauge the effectiveness of the vax (and the system delivering
it) using the 1% method. Deaths in US are 1.11 million, `1.11 /
(330*0.01)` equals 0.33 meaning 67% were saved.

Will Dr. Luigi go on trial for possibly triggering this pandemic?

Some nasty effin thing this virus is..

That would be the optimistic scenario, a lower bound. If we
[assume](2020/02/corona.html) overall mortality rate of 1%, the
outcome could reach over 10 million. Assume with an half effective
vax, the final number could be at about 5 mil.

MHI has tech for pure NH3 based power plants too. So many
options.. with some coal, or completely without coal.. Such are the
benefits of a solid base tech.

H2 View: "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is set to conduct a
feasibility study for the introduction of ammonia co-firing at a
coal-fired thermal power plant in Thailand, in pursuit ofa
decarbonising power production with hydrogen-based fuels"

Fast Fashion Facts:

- We buy 60% more than we did in 2000 but each garment is kept for half as long.
- Of the billions of clothing items made each year, over half are thrown away.
- The fashion industry employs millions of people but only around 2% earn a living wage.
- 60% of clothes are made from synthetic fabrics derived from fossil fuels.
- The production of textiles produces almost 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 per year"

H2 Fuel News: "China has the most hydrogen stations of any country in

Obviously, mining as a means to encourage server availability was an
obscenely stupid idea caused waste of precious energy.

---

Open social media can provide the backdrop for fantastic net-centric
apps to be developed. Bitcoin bribed miners with mined money reward so
their machines provided other services to users. OSM servers are
already available for socmed purposes anyway, will probably outnumber
miner machines pretty soon, and on that processing power many services
can be built.. Digital currency is only one example.

"@anildash@me.dm

Really clear to me that the new web of fediverse.. is moving very
quickly towards something pretty amazing. As much promise as all the
hype of “Web3”, but open, interoperable, and no ties to crypto
scams. A lot of incredible things are going to be built across this
surface area in the next few years"
