H2 View: "Steel-giant thyssenkrupp has announced it will invest €2bn
($2.01bn) to transform its plant in Duisburg, Germany into one of the
largest hydrogen-powered direct reduction plants"

Can latest UKR gains be used as basis for piece summit? Defenders can
boast they are now negotiating from a "position of strength", RU has
Donetsk, Crimea and a land bridge from Russia to both.. Maybe time to
call this thing quits and turn on the gas tap. Or will the war
continue throughout the winter?

The Guardian: "Richard Stengel [Dem, formerly State Dept] criticized
media coverage of the Queen’s death, saying on MSNBC that though Queen
Elizabeth’s 'unrivaled service' should be lauded, she still presided
over more than 30 countries as head of state and her family’s legacy
of colonialism 'had a terrible effect on much of the world'"

---

The Guardian: "Harvard University history professor Maya Jasanoff
wrote in the New York Times that the Queen’s stoic presence in life as
a 'fixture of stability' underlied a 'stolid traditionalist front over
decades of violent upheaval'"

"@MukomaWaNgugi

If the queen had apologized for slavery, colonialism and
neocolonialism and urged the crown to offer reparations for the
millions of lives taken in her/their names, then perhaps I would do
the human thing and feel bad. As a Kenyan, I feel nothing. This
theater is absurd"

One party leader spoke up for Assange, but he is considered the "town
fool" by mainstream anyway, the issue was ignored.

Prev talk on Australia becoming a Republic is now AWOL. Did it ever
makes sense strategically? They need a relationship with a naval power
cementing their connection to the outer alliance by still being in
CWealth would be helpful there.. If the mainstream could not say a
word edgewise on Assange, why would bother with change into a
Republic?

The RU gas dependency increased throughout Schroder and Merkel
era.. Mutti was also keeping the easties in check when they freaked
out on Russia. The strategy went ahead past 2008, 2014 .. Nordstream 2
was shepherded through road blocks by CDU itself who now became rapid
RU hawks.

Hands-on info is always helpful; before writing on H2 I did a little
water splitting myself. Iron electrodes, wrong path gets you sodium
chloride, [no-no](https://youtu.be/T-OwWOYHhMI?t=266), used graphite,
it worked - produced H2.

CNBC: "The clean hydrogen energy economy was a dream. The climate bill
could make it a reality this decade"

"Researchers Discover a Single Catalyst Capable of Splitting Both
Freshwater and Seawater at Low Voltage..  [They] report using a nickel
/ molybdenum / nitrogen compound, tweaked with a small amount of iron
and grown on nickel foam to efficiently produce hydrogen and then,
through a process of electrochemical reconstruction sparked by cycling
voltage, converted to a compound that produced a similarly powerful
oxygen evolution reaction.

The researchers said using a single compound for both the hydrogen
evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) –
albeit slightly changed through the reconstruction process – not only
makes water splitting more affordable, it also simplifies the
engineering challenges"

KBR: "[Our] large-scale blue hydrogen process uses its proprietary
KRES and well-proven SMR-based technology for expanding single-stream
hydrogen capacity. Bulk of the CO2 generated in the process is
captured as pure CO2, readily available for CO2 capture
applications... Flue gas generation is about 50% lower than
conventional processes.. CO2 recovery >95% of the total CO2 generated
as process CO2 is feasible with minor energy penalty. This can
eliminate requirement of post combustion CO2 capture plant - High
CAPEX and OPEX savings"
