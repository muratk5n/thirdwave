'Reducing methane going into the atmosphere is the most cost-effective
way to reduce climate change today. We don’t need major changes in
technology, we don’t need to find places where we can stick methane
deep into the earth.' – Professor Bryce Kelly, UNSW"

CCS at the source is ideal bcz if natgas travels in the pipes, goes
into cities, heaters, storage, it will leak. See

The amount of potential energy sitting in reserves in the form of
natural gas is huge, it would be foolish not to use it. Shared a post
on the Qatar North Field before. Saudi Ghawar oil field is big, this
thing is bigger. Ghawar has been producing crude oil for the entire
world since the 40s - NF tops that!

---

That is great actually.. With some additional cost for CCS, blue H2
production can have little or emissions. Until green forms of
production, if it arrives, the natgas path will increase H2
adoption. 

H2 Fuel News: "US hydrogen production gets support from $8 billion
H2Hubs program.. The Department of Energy launched the program this
month [which treats] all forms of H2 the same.. The idea is to use
methods more readily available to begin making H2 sooner and to
encourage earlier adoption."

Markets only really crash from oversold conditions. Equity markets are
confronted with the unholy trinity of rising interest rates, a rising
oil price and a rising dollar. Selling by retail has been
minimal. Last Thursday saw record one day inflows. $ARKK has seen
inflows in 10 of the last 13 weeks despite a 50% YTD decline in share
price.. These are things one does not see at a bottom. The complacency
is staggering.  I fear that the investing public will soon get the
memo and that there will be a rush for the exits. The Fed safety net
has Been removed. In fact, the Fed put has been replaced by a Fed
call. Whatever happened to don’t fight the Fed?"

You could replace the word Greece with Asia Minor and the story would
still make sense. Means of production defines (nearly)
everything. Cultures around near regions are similar (bcz they produce
similarly). Asia Minor has a lot of Hellenic culture in it. Obviously
as countries modernize they go through changes, but I argue similar
countries still modernize similarly.

The way Dr. Oz simply regurgitated culture war material and still won

Davis: "Throughout the first three months of the war, there were
almost universal positive statements by U.S. and Ukrainian leaders,
suggesting Kyiv’s troops would 'drive Russia from' Ukrainian soil and
that Kyiv would not accept any negotiated settlement that ceded any
territory to Russia. Yet earlier this week London’s *The Independent*
revealed portions of a leaked classified intelligence report out of
Kyiv that exposed a much harsher battlefield reality than had been
admitted publicly..

According to the report, Russia’s relentless bombardment of Ukrainian
troops over the first 100+ days of the war had destroyed major
portions of their Soviet-era equipment and depleted their stocks of
artillery ammunition. The result is that frontline Ukrainian units are
outgunned 20-1 in artillery and an eye-popping 40-1 in artillery
rounds. Combined with the fact Russia continues to have significant
advantages in air power (up to 300 air sorties per day compared with
three to five for Ukraine) and manpower, it is not surprising Ukraine
is losing its grip on the Donbas...

While it is entirely understandable that no Ukrainian leader would
ever want to cede any of its country to an invading power, there are
other, harsher realities that must be taken into account.. Zelensky
and the Ukrainian people will soon come face-to-face with the ugly
prospect that continuing to fight will only bring more death and
destruction to its people, cities, and armed forces – but be
insufficient to stave off defeat. The truth is, military fundamentals
and simple capacity are in Moscow’s favor"
