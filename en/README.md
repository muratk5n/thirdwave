Different core energy sources all generating H2 fuel will
automatically ensure supply availability. Most cars use gasoline -from
crude oil-, much of heating uses natural gas.. But if crude oil and
natural gas *both* generate H2, and cars and heating *both* use H2,
then supply problems with either NG, or crude will be less
important. Not to mention solar, hydro which can be used to generate
clean fuel as well, adding to the supply, increasing the overall
resillience of the energy system. H2/NH3 will be the "molecular lingua
franca" of energy transmission, allowing all kinds of raw energy
source to be used by varied types of consumption.

Europe, landmass-wise, is very small compared to Asia. US/Canada are
far from the West direction, but they can go on bickering on the East,
over the Pacific... Maybe good for my native hood; Both sides, go the

Extreme case for RU, if UKR is "pacified", it will be a true buffer
with the West, the mega-sanctions will ensure that, and RU will
"decouple", lean towards Asia.

One can read too much into this "pipeline-politics", its related
"strategery".. "Control through pipelines" etc.. "Dude what's the
path?". Nordstream 2 does not go through UKR, but some ppl there were
flipping out about Nordstream 1 *because* it would go through
Ukraine. The reasoning was 'Russia will hold that pipeline over
Ukrain, if they cut it we wont get our transit fees' ü§î

Need that IRN gas output in case RU becomes unavailable, or at least

"Now [some are] talking about a situation where you defeat the
Russians in Ukraine. This is a much worse outcome for the Russians
than what happened in April 2008, and a much worse outcome .. [than]
in February 2014...  [T]he russians are not going to roll over and
play dead,.. they're going to crush the Ukrainians, they're going to
bring out the big guns, .. to turn places like [Kyiv] and other cities
in Ukraine into rubble. They're going to do Fallujas, they're going to
do Mosuls, they're going to do Groznies.

[Remember] what happened in [WWII] when the United States was faced
with the possibility of having to invade the Japanese home islands in
early 1945. The idea of invading the Japanese home islands after what
happened at Iwo Jima and then later what happened in Okinawa really
spooked us, so.. we decided to burn Japanese cities to the ground
starting on March 10th 1945. We killed more people the first night, we
firebombed Tokyo, than we killed at either Hiroshima or Nagasaki, and
we were systematically burning Japanese cities to the ground. Why?
Because we did not want to invade the Japanese main islands. [This is
what happens w]hen a great power feels threatened"
