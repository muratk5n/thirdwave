Post nationhood my ass.. During the 90s there was that talk, been
proven false since. Talking abt administrative boundaries obviously,
gov, regional or supra.. They do matter. 

During Brexit final deal they were negotiating details down to the
species of fish. Every damn thing was looked at, and is looked at
through the prism of a border.

One thinker for each domain. No more.

There can only be one.

This way I can guarantee focus.

---

We use a little trick in this site.. I "have a guy" for each sub
domain. That guy (or gal) is the sole voice for that domain. For
anthropology Ian Morris, for social/tech Toffler,
psychology/marketing Rapaille, etc. I weave these pieces together
to achieve [greater-sum](2021/04/sum-greater-than-whole-reductionism.md).
In a way I simulate an insitutional setting. But still, u r better off
following MSM. You will rise or sink with the muckers.

Wout ed control, outside inst setting, I assume most blogs, substacks
have lesser quality ..  My DIY quality filter.

Braciole with gabagool..? I like the idea

One thing people don't know about the Potato Famine was that Ireland
remained a net exporter of food crops at the time. It wasn't that food
was scarce it was that poor citizens couldn't afford it. Modern
industrialized society distributes resources based on class prejudice"

Down* mixed in.. Well-made. "Guy with normal life goes on a rampage",
are movs like this the drug needed to keep arthritic modern man from
going completely nuts? Satisfying the inner hunter-gatherer?

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
