What reader would ever complain about overly detailed derivations? Not
me, for sure; I've Iost countless hours figuring out those missing
steps!"

---

"@HiroNishikawa

Now a reviewer says there are too many details in the
derivations. Sometimes, too much information is better than lack of
information; it helps avoid confusions and ambiguities. But for this I
can cut a lot of intermediate steps; and I can leave them all in a
preprint"

True liberterians could actually affect some change here; they would
be for the abolition of F-F. If democracy worked they'd do their
thing, the left would do the outside-the-market help thing, overall
things would approach to some kind of working setup. Instead there is
a weird mush of market/non-market solutions, and the 'heated debates'
are on stupid culture war.

On the previously shared Eslake comment "Schemes that allow people to
pay more for housing than they otherwise would, will result in more
expensive housing". Then how can we help people to have housing?

Increasingly it looks like butting into market mechanism can
backfire. So best help in any area should aim to take entire swaths of
said area out of the market-based system. For health insurance,
single-payer is much better right (which takes nearly the totality of
health insurance out of private scheme) than trying to co-exist with
the market which fails to insure everyone (Obamacare).

For housing, gov can pay, employ, manage projects seperately, outside
the market structure to build, deliver housing. Slightly nudging one
rate here, fiddling with the market there can create unwanted
side-effects. In US we saw it happen; those orgs Eddie, Freddie,
Fannie, whatever, they've there for decades, yet in US house prices
now reached nearly half a million dollars. Fannie, Freddie being the
bizarre in/out market creations they are, fueled the Great Financial
Crisis too and nearly caused the collapse of the system.

Some use the term as in journalism done with raw data; That's nice
too, but I mean publishing of raw data as journalism.

---

Data journalism would be fly; imagine there is
http://data.nytimes.com, or `data.washingtonpost.com`, and every major
event, like war, gets its relative URL, for Ukraine-Russia war
situation the regions assesed, claimed could be published in daily
JSON files on /conflict/ukr/20220424/map.json; people interested can
fetch, process, plot.

But it is very likely MI6 had her assasinated. That part is a tragedy.

That is a stretch.. I remember after her death they were throwing out
those words, 'she was like Mother Teresa'.. my girlfriend at the time
took a major issue with that.. Mother Teresa lived with the poor,
spent her life among them. What did Diana do? Make a diva entrance to
some event, and disappear afterwards? C'mon.

Most Kurds live without an official country. They certainly cannot
join NATO, have no diplomatic basis to even consider it. The Kurds who
were a threat to TR became that way because of latter's failed

"Isn't the situation of Kurds same as Ukraine's?

No *entente cordiale* saz the article..

Politico: "Donâ€™t expect Macronâ€™s win to reset UK-France ties.. Yet
British officials â€” who have previously blamed the French electoral
campaign for rows with Macronâ€™s government on everything from
post-Brexit fishing rights to a nuclear submarine deal with Australia
and the treatment of undocumented Channel migrants â€” donâ€™t expect a
huge diplomatic reset to follow the result.

Instead, theyâ€™re eyeing more modest wins, and hoping for more dialogue
between the two leaders in the coming months. And, despite Johnsonâ€™s
hopeful remarks, the mood music coming out of the French government
Monday wasnâ€™t drastically different either"
