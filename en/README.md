it."

OpIndia: "While India is taking the side of Armenia in the ongoing
conflict, Azerbaijan is supported by [TR, ISR]. Armenia is generally
supported by Russia but due to Russia’s preoccupation in Ukraine, they
are getting only limited assistance. In such a scenario, the defence
deal with India can prove crucial for Armenia"

It's bizarre. But if they burn the shit might as well make use of
it. CCUS would be nice.

ISS: "Gas flaring is the burning of unwanted natural gas in oil
wells. Globally, the practice has persisted since oil production
started over 160 years ago. Nigeria is a leading offender, despite gas
flaring being illegal since 2005. The toxic fumes cause many
environmental and health problems"

Do they *have* to flare?

"Nigeria has said its plan to commercialise gas burned (flaring) from
its oilfields"

Countries bring up WWII reperations whenever DE does something they
don't like... Are the Germans about to do something the Poles will not
like? Something on Russia?

Al Jazeera: "Poland demands nearly $1.3 trillion in WWII damages from
Germany"

H2 Fuel News: "EasyJet pours 'multi-million' dollar investment into
hydrogen planes.. The European airline is betting on Rolls Royce H2
jet engine development to meet its 2050 targets"

Could EPC serve as a backdoor Bremain (or Breturn) for Brits? For
candidate countries it could be a half-way house EU.. France always
wants to do something on its own.. what happened to the Mediterrenian
Union? But EPC could be a good thing..

Reuters: "UK Prime Minister Liz Truss's decision to join the inaugural
summit of [France's European Political Community] this week has given
a boost to the initiative.. A key aim for Macron is to embrace EU
candidate countries that are losing patience waiting for membership of
the bloc..  'One of the points is to be able to tell Kosovo and
Albania we can do things with them, and they don't have to rely only
on Russia and China for investment,' a French official said"

"@Pontifex

After seven months of hostilities in \#Ukraine, let us use all
diplomatic means, even those that have not been used so far, to bring
an end to this terrible tragedy. War is an error and a horror!
\#Russia \#Peace"

"@culturaltutor

Do you ever feel that some cities are just more alive than others?
It's probably because they're 'mixed-use'. An area of a city (or town)
is mixed-use when you've got residential, commercial, and cultural
buildings all together"

The market must have been spooked by econ possibly heating up due to
lower taxes causing more inflation (risk for bondholders). Keeping
things calm, talking about balanced budgets (not that it directly
effects inflation) could also be conservative.. Sunak was actually
taking that line during the leadership race, but could not sell it.
As long they do it the "right" way not some centrist cuck way, it's
fine.

Reuters: "Truss forced into U-turn on tax after week of market
turmoil.. reversing a cut to the highest rate of income tax"

Conflicting reports. Will revisit map.

TASS: "Ukrainian troops attempted to break through Kherson Region
defenses from three directions but their attempts from two sides were
thwarted"

Some advances on UA side.. Lyman is retaken (at what cost?), an
advance in Kherson even (pt \#3, old frontline is gray). Losing \#1
will be a huge problem and that is likely.
