Metal hydrides are very promising tech for storage, see Australian
company Lavo.

H2 View: "A Norwegian school is planned to become home to what is said
to be the world’s largest metal hydride-based hydrogen storage
facility. Hybrid Energy revealed on Tuesday (July 12), that its
daughter company Hystorsys had won a contract to install the hydrogen
storage at the Vestiden Junior Highschool in Kongsberg, Norway.

Hystorsys, a spin off from the Norwegian Institute for Energy
Technology (IFE), plans to install its storage solution at the school
to store excess energy produced by solar panels during the summer as
hydrogen, ready for winter consumption..

Hybrid Energy says its storage solution has the ability to store 1kg
of hydrogen in a 17-litre metal hydride unit at 30 bar, by comparison
to more traditional storage units offering 1kg in 42-litre units at
350 bar"

Rajapaksas were everywhere \#SriLanka... should've guessed some were
obviously connected to the last major success in that nation, beating

brother was President. That kind of success buys you a lot of
political capital (now all lost).
