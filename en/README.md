H2 Fuel News: "The Argentine province Tierra del Fuego, an island
region best recognized for its location at the very tip of South
America, is seeking to begin hydrogen production for economic
diversification as the world moves away from fossil fuels and toward
clean sources of energy.. For the local hydrogen production strategy,
the area is seeking $6 billion in investments"

---

H2 View: "Australian powerhouses in the running for [large] green
hydrogen project in New Zealand.. Southern Green Hydrogen, a joint
venture between Contact Energy and Meridian Energy, revealed Woodside
Energy and Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) are set to provide
detailed proposals to decide the selection of lead developer for the
Southern Green Hydrogen project"

"Chevron Eyes 2.5bn Investments in Low-Carbon Hydrogen.. Chevron plans
to spend about 2.5-billion building up its hydrogen business this
decade as the oil major accelerates investment in low-carbon
technologies. Chevron will develop both green and blue hydrogen, said
Austin Knight, vice president of […] The post Chevron Eyes $2.5bn
Investments in Low-Carbon Hydrogen appeared first on Hydrogen Central"

The Independent: "A man in Pennsylvania man died after he attempted to
light a cigarette while using an oxygen concentrator at his home in
North Coventry Township"

---

Good call

AFP: "Swimming to set up an 'open category' to allow transgender
athletes to compete. The new policy effectively bans them from taking
part in women's races"

---

Sea canals, if large enough, could also provide a natural border,
barrier and protection.  All neighbors of Russia, build your canals
now! If I were Kazakhstan I'd start diggin ASAP.

---

Maybe we should just dig canals everywhere instead of bulding roads.

---

Hah. Floating stuff vs land transport.. If you do the physics, that
would probably check out. Moving stuff horizontally on sea probably
takes less energy than on land, even with rail. There is that pesky
friction to worry about on land.. it messes up everything.

They also have a major drug trafficking problem - see the drug map
below.

"Bulgaria’s government faces collapse this week.. PM Kiril Petkov
sought to tackle rampant corruption and to take a strong position
against the Kremlin"

---

Beta wasn't low enough, now we are switching to gamma.

---

On some issues the Chinese act like the worst type of Democrat
centrist gamma cuck.

NDTV: "China's mass testing mantra is building a waste mountain"

---

Hindustan Times: "Britain set for biggest rail strike in decades"

---

Segments about young people are getting old.. Funny. And sad.

---

News segment about "generation change"; the younger generation
supposedly wanting change and proposing stuff.. Even that is getting
old.

---

"[US] military-entertainment complex". Yes.

---

Hindustan Times: "UK pushed 100,000 people into poverty by lifting pension age"

---

ISR built a wall, created an unofficial border, then they go on the
other side of the wall and shoot bunch of people..

---

Near the border, meaning the man was shot on **his** side of the wall,
not on Israeli side.

---

WION: "53-year-old Palestinian man was killed by the Israeli forces
near the border in Qalqilya city."

---

If govs wanted these ppl can be hurt in a big way at the major hubs,
UK, Spain, Italy (which made a big bust recently). At sources too
naturally such as Colombia. 

---

I wonder what will Petros will do about the Colombian drug trade

---

The left in asccendance.

The Independent: "Colombia picks 1st leftist president [Petros] in
tight runoff contest"

---

French leftist coalition earned second place in parliamentary seats,
Le Pen made some gains too..

---

Spain, Italy, Bulgaria, UK, Belgium are major end points in Europe.
Spain especially, crazy connectivity.

Iran - damn. Colombia, makes sense. 

China-Paraguay? There was that one 2012 major bust apparently, so it
shows on the map.

India, Australia, Germany, Japan are relatively clean. 

---

Taliban are jihadi mofos too, in a different way

---

Maybe "somebody" was bothered about their drug money being cut on the
Pakistani side, ppl with connection in mil and a line into the jihadi
m--f--kers used one of them to send a message.

---

Coincidence? Hmmm

CBC News: "Islamic State says attack on Sikh temple is revenge for Prophet insults"

---

DW: "[2022/6/2] Taliban start to enforce ban on poppy
cultivation.. Afghanistan’s Taliban rulers have begun a campaign to
eradicate poppy cultivation, aiming to wipe out the country’s massive
production of opium and heroin"

---

Pakistan became a **major** source for the drug trade; they are
Afghanistan's neighbor, their meddling, coup-loving military would
have long-time relations there, I'm sure many deep state gov officials
look the other way when drug trade is being conducted, if not
officially partake in it themselves.

---

Data from a UN agency, at least some vaguely proper data is there this
time, but every year's data is in a seperate Excel sheet. ??. I had to
write extra "preprocessing" code to combine stuff. Keep it simple.
Put data on Github so it is version controlled.

"China's Xi says trade with Russia expected to hit new records in the
coming months"
