What food was foreign to (most) hunter-gatherers? Tomatoes. For many
in the "Old World", until 16th century there were no tomatoes. The veg
is associated with Italian cooking, but this is a mistake, a recent
development... They, nor or the Greeks, or anyone wld have known it
before 16th.. So if you dont like tomatoes, do not feel
bad. Biologically we did not need it, not part of our evolution, so
can safely be eliminated from diets.

There was no god damn [missile gap](2021/08/cuban-missile-crisis.md#berlin).
JFK either lied or foolishly believed in it himself, likely the former.
There was a missile gap much earlier, that's why US placed missiles in TR.
Bcz of the 60s missile gap, this time with USSR at a disadvantage, USSR
wanted to place missiles in Cuba.

"How about the missile gap of 1960s? JFK won the election thanks to it"

Another Berlin story, [Checkpoint Charlie](2021/08/cuban-missile-crisis.md#berlin).

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
