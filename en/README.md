Also let's consider the extra burden HPs will bring on the grid -
which is a fragile system to begin with. A clean gas pipeline would be
much more robust, scalable. Pipes can deliver energy 10 times faster
compared to the grid.

"Before.. heat pump went in, we were paying £250 a month in oil..
January had a lot of really icy days and it’s been the longest
sustained bout of cold weather we’ve experienced since moving in. Last
month, we consumed 2,231 kWh of electricity electricity, just for the
air source heat pump, which is a crazy amount at around 72kWh per day"

I see some efficiency numbers for heat pumps that are plain
non-sense. I'd look at how much extra is paid after HP is installed, a
simple before/after comparison.

---

Heat pumps cannot power stoves - but H2 piped into homes can provide
both heating and help with cooking. Heating is extremely power hungry
and work best through molecules, fuels; currently natgas, LPG,
hopefully later clean fuels.

Clean ammonia can be transported cleanly, 'cracked' to take out
hydrogen, and finally ammonia itself can be used in turbines to
generate power. What's not to like?

Power Mag: "[2021/3] Mitsubishi Power Developing 100% Ammonia-Capable
Gas Turbine.. [MP] is developing a 40-MW class gas turbine that can
directly combust 100% ammonia under an initiative that responds to
heightened global decarbonization ambitions, as well as Japan’s recent
roadmap for ammonia fuel"

H2 Central: "Chevron is among a group of multinational companies
looking at the U.S. Gulf Coast as a central hub for the development of
hydrogen and ammonia... working with Air Liquide, Lyondell Basell and
Uniper to study the potential for a hydrogen and ammonia production
facility.. This project would deploy technologies that have potential
to capture and sequester CO2 to produce lower carbon intensity
hydrogen and ammonia"

AFR Map - Added Western Sahara, Central African Republic, and Tunisia,
a "major non-NATO ally". TUN is surely not enjoying the pressure it is
getting for their non-democratic turn from US but I put them in the
US-friendly list. Western Sahara is in limbo internationally, but RU
now sides with it against Morocco (see item 21/2).

I'm glad. Ramaph is a strong H2 supporter

him a second term as the country’s leader after elections scheduled
