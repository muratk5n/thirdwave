H2 View: "CEO of Raven SR, on their waste-to-hydrogen technology: [W]e
can take the Chinese take away, process the rice thatâ€™s inside of it,
the cardboard container, the plastic fork or the plastic chopsticks
that are with it and the little metal container. The whole thing can
go into our system. I donâ€™t have to separate all that and we take it
wet, which is really unique. Many processes have to dry it. Many
processes have to be very selective on their waste, so it gives us
that ability to work very closely where waste is, whatever that waste
might be.. [This is] why Raven SRâ€™s technology is making such waves in
the industry. Several waste products can be taken, including negative
wastes such as plastics, and be converted into hydrogen"

Mongolian gov should encourage converting those coal plants into IGCC,
or oxy-combustion coal plants which have CCS. Generate clean fuel,
pipe fuel to homes. Install [H2 ready boilers](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FPxKxr1X0Ag0WD7?format=jpg&name=small).
Done.

Mind-boggling.. 

The Mirror: "The sky could be the brightest blue, but in the winter
months no one in Mongoliaâ€™s capital city would be able to tell because
of the lingering smog.. In winter, temperatures in the worldâ€™s coldest
capital can plummet to minus 20 and the only way for many people to
stay warm is to burn raw coal"

Cannot have people living on sidewalks.. If they have rights, as city

I agree. Homes have been too expensive, effecting all prices down the

Good move.. do they also provide housing?

Japan wanted to buy F-22 but were denied. So they built their own,
the so-called F-X.

---

F-35 always sounded like a produce-by-commitee, bastardized version of
a combat airplane. F-22 though more expensive was top notch (but
discontinued). An updated F-22 would be a boon but US spending is too
much on def already. And still no M4A.

Business Insider: "The era of unlimited options at the grocery store
is likely a thing of the past. Have you been to the grocery store
recently and noticed that one of your regular buys was missing? You're
not going crazy. The pandemic has caused workforce issues that mean
itâ€™s more expensive to produce the same amount of goods, and a key
strategy to deal with that is to reduce the varieties of products
manufactured"

They can't assert shit unless somebody is blowing that wind beneath
their wings.. That's how you "fly high". Papa Aliyev had come to power
thanks to a "BP Coup" back in the day, BP as in British Petroleum, and
recent war gains are possibly due to a nudge from UK again and the
other "poodle's poodle".

policies"

externally, at a distance. Rules. If ppl dont follow them, send a

War crime

Politico: "After a period of testing, on this day in 1962, President
John F. Kennedy gave final approval to.. a massive effort to defoliate
the forests of Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos with an herbicide known as
Agent Orange...During the decade of spraying, more than 5 million
acres of forest and 500,000 acres of crops were heavily damaged or
destroyed...

Dean Rusk.. had told Kennedy.. that '[t]he use of defoliant does not
violate any rule of international law concerning the conduct of
chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war. Precedent has been
established by the British during the emergency in Malaya in their use
of aircraft for destroying crops by chemical spraying.'

In 1967, 17 Nobel laureates and 5,000 other scientists signed a
petition asking for the immediate end to the use of herbicides in
Vietnam. The administration ignored it...

The spraying program led some 3 million Vietnamese to suffer health
problems caused by exposure to Agent Orange, including a million birth
defects"
