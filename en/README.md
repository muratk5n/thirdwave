Guy builds an shoddy house, and expects cheap energy to heat that
house, then votes reps out who don't provide him that 'way of
life'. That demand has repercussions down the line. Gov now needs to
secure that (excess) energy, deploy military to secure its transport,
deploy overseas shadowy intel apparatus to stir shit up to keep local
actors out of balance to make sure raw crude keeps flowing.. Or cld
the f-ing guy just insulate his house w gov nudging him in that
direction somewhat?

---

If a building is poorly insulated, should government be able to tax it
out of existence?

Personal property.. But a house is not just a house..

Insulation; there it is again.

Euronews: "The eat or heat dilemma... More than 35 million Europeans
are unable to afford to keep their homes warm this winter..  having to
decide between heating and putting food on the table.. The two root
causes of fuel or energy poverty are low incomes and living in
buildings with low energy efficiency..

The price of energy is a significant proportion of the cost of living
in Bulgaria, especially for the poorest households. In 2018, it
represented around 16 percent of expenditure, while in Sweden average
energy costs were around 4 percent.. Energy poverty is worst in the
south of Europe..  If Sweden is doing fine now, it's ..  because of 30
years of Swedish investment in renovating houses, in developing
renewable heating systems" via @ThPellerin

But if there is too much credit out there, then the economy "stars to
heat up", can be inflationary.

---

Bank credit does not come from bank customers' savings, they are
printed money, so money base expands. The system works because even
though the money base grows (through credit), the economy *grows into
that* base (credit was used to invest, hire ppl etc); more products,
services are circulating, but more money does not chase after the same
amount of goods, it chases after more amt of goods - no inflation.

---

Because businesses work on credit, and credit is always newly printed
money, so when businesses hand out salaries they are handing out that
new money. That could result in inflation.

"If printing money and handing it to people creates inflation why do
wage increases cause inflation?"

Opec oil production is down for sure.

Gas prices were high during W, even higher than now.. Interesting, the
uptrend seems to have started at around 2003 -- after the invasion of
Iraq? Major uptick again post Libya 2011.

A love for privatisation, going ga-ga for biz cld have doomed
California's high-speed train project. States offload too much onto
the private sector, they are not retaining the key skills in their own
bureucracies who can plan, manage? 2014, CA outsources to a company
called Dragados, 'cost reduction' ended up costing *more*. How did
that slip by the officials?

Politico: "In 2021, the SEC went after crypto. In 2022, crypto is

Org has to make clear it will not "spread" democracy in underhanded
ways. No disruption of internal affairs of others. 

---

Sure Russia wld be in, but with a low score. 

---

What benefits are we talking about? Lots and lots of money..  And
transfer of know-how. The treasure chest needs to be so large as to be
mouth-watering... Once in, members can be ranked on their democratic
status annually , money inflow gets adjusted to a cent depending on
the score.. If org votes collectively on stuff, even their vote's
weight can be adjusted based on the score even.

---

Ideafication time.. A new intl org for that is not tasked with
spreading democracy proactively, but whose members happen to, has to
be democratic. Once countries join they get major benefits. NATO
served that purpose for Asia Minor, they were scared of USSR, a
precursor for joining to NATO was being a democracy, so country
started the change. Same for Greece too probably.. Both countries fell
in-and-out of dem at certain times, but insitutionally democracy in
some form remained.

---

One explanation could be new US admin's emphasis on democracy scared
autocrats in partly democratic countries, scared US will come for them
at some point so they did their coups beforehand to cement their
shit.. Ergo talk of spreading democracy caused less democracy? But
then if admin did not talk about it, how could it push for it?

NYT: "Five African Countries. Six Coups. Why Now? Burkina Faso this

military takeovers"

Found a dataset from Illinois Uni (below). Overall trend seems down
(does not contain recent data).

Coups seem to have increased in number 

---

Countries circling Mali, most part of an org called Ecowas, sanctioned
Mali bcz of coup (14/1), but then one of the Ecowas members had a coup
itself (23/1). That is hilarious.
