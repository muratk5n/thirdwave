Growth potential of a country has an upper bound. Given a skillset
level, know-how, labor, access to materials, growth can reach a
certain amount, no more.  Any new money that exceeds that growth
potential will be inflationary. 

---

Credit to businesses can be inflationary.. This is key; most, for some
reason, exclusively focus on government spending a view goaded by MSM
to deflect the attention from the real source of money printing -
credit. When businesses go to banks for credit the bank does not use
customers' savings to hand out loans - they'll just print the
money. Once that money makes it to people's pockets through wages, if
in excess amounts, it becomes inflationary.

Apparenty a lot of raw data on RU/UKR war comes from a group of
Russian journalists called Rybar, they publish on Telegram.  They have
good info indicating inside access, so far reporting is deemed
to be accurate.

It's good stuff, makes for a hearty soup

"One of the oldest foods in the Eastern Mediterranean, *trahana*
[Asia Minor *tarhana*] was traditionally made in August as an
ingenious method of preserving milk for the cold winter months by
combining the dairy with the wheat and leaving in the hot summer
sun to dry over a few days. Once dried, it was broken into
granules and could be stored for months"

*Haskalah* is a 19th century phenomenon, started in Europe, not
anywhere else. 

---

Of course the new arrivals innovated, they were bunch of Europeans,
with all the know-how that comes with it... Remember *Schindler's
List* (based on a true story), all those factory workers he saved,
well, those workers ran his factory, they had to know-how to do it, a
knowledge bequeathed on them for the simple fact of being in the West.
After WWII survivors fleed, some went to Israel. Israelis became
"cowboys" for the Americans now, but they largely benefited from the
knowledge from Western Renaissance.

1937 predates the foundation of Israel itself. Water is crucial..  

"[Founded in 1937] Mekorot is the national water company of Israel and

On smartphone, whole RPi VNC desktop looks too small in landscape
mode? Use the phone in portrait, zoom to one side of the desktop,
and start all programs there. RPi res is on board, `/boot/config.txt`.
Editors, PDF readers, all look great (typically tall, thin windows
anyway).

---

Using tablet USB output as power source for RPi, good idea. No need
for a seperate powerbank. Those Li-On batteries are heavy as shit.

Fortune: "Before ‘quiet quitting’ in the U.S., there was ‘lying flat’
in China. How the anti-work movement swept the world’s two largest
economies..

A world apart, 'lying flat' and 'quiet quitting' have sprouted
parallel passive resistance movements among young people in the
world’s top two economies, flouting assumptions that Gen Z will work
just as hard as previous generations.

Individual followers of the movements have their own motivations—from
pandemic-era burnout to existential dread—but a shared sense economic
defeatism is binding them together as they confront critics and defy
workaholic cultures in China and the U.S."

At once both naive and shady.. those merry band of mucksuckers around

You just left the man high and dry, Focker? What kind of political
approach is this?

WaPo: "Mitch McConnell called Peter Thiel, the billionaire investor
who had pumped $15 million into a super PAC backing Vance, to
congratulate him but also to make a request: Since McConnell’s
resources were limited, the senator said, would Thiel continue to
finance Vance through the general election? Thiel demurred"

Why did boomers retire early? Once covid hit they probably said "I'm
old, it's not worth risking it by increasing exposure by going to
work, so I'll just retire a few years early".
