H2 can be turned into food! Can fuel machines, can fuel people!

NovoNutrients: "[Our] fermentation platform is powered by patent
pending microbes and proprietary bioreactors. The organisms transform
emissions, along with hydrogen and oxygen, into complete, safe,
natural single cell protein (SCP). This first harvest is then dried
and refined to the desired concentration of protein... The result? A
new pillar of the food system, decoupled from agriculture and,
ultimately, from fossil fuels"

Energy content, capacity is reported in kilowatt-hour or gigawatt-hour - that
is the amount of energy. Gigawatt (wout the hour) is a rate, a
flow of sorts; I lift a ton of water up, it has potential stored energy
(kwh, gwh). Poke a hole, water will flow out, which has power in kw or gw,
flow can turn a wheel, do work. Water can have 2 KWh of (potential) energy,
if I poked a hole for 1 kilowatt worth, water runs out in two hours.

That's how conversion is done; if I have a fuel amount in a certain
time, eg barrel per day as below, I calculate GWh from that, divide by
24, I get the power. It's easier to compare when all output is brought
down to unit time level.

1 barrel of crude oil carries approximately 1700 kwh of energy. An
output of 13 million barrels of oil per day translates into,

```python
int(1700*13*1e6/(24*1000*1000))
```

```text
Out[1]: 920
```

920 GW, nearly 1 *terrawatt* of energy output.

Actually maybe the writing wasn't fantasticaly great, it just wasn't
insanely stupid, had a natural flow, things made sense, which nowadays
comes across as pure genius.

*Eraser: Reborn* was a good movie. Good writing, well directed, well acted.

Return-free risk instead of risk-free return.. good one

@gnoble79

.. I remain very bearish. Yes there will be counter trend bear market
rallies but stocks will ultimately go MUCH lower. Equities continue to
represent RETURN FREE RISK

How much new money? Decided by crypto-reps. That commitee would be
deciding an upper bound for the inflation essentially, since price
rises by definition could not exceed that amount. Too many money
hoarders? Up new money creation to 50%, inflate away their shit, then
come back to 2%.

---

An improved crypto would print money as UBI each month, grow the
money base and new money can be lent as credit to businesses, through
crypto-reps chosen by people annually. Currently new money enters econ
through credit to businesses. New money needs to go to people first.
