many activists consider an even more existential decision: whether it
will reform the filibuster to pass that legislation"

*Dune* wasn't cuck. In fact they even reversed some stuff from

"[2019] The US military’s logistical train is slowly snaking toward
China... the center of military policy is increasingly gravitating
toward U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, according to U.S. government

logistical tail of warfare takes time to put in place and because the
Pacific theater is one of the most difficult environments for moving
supplies"
