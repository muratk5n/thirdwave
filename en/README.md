Business Insider: "Some of them call it 'antiwork.' It's a trend
bolstered by younger workers, as Gen Zers make their mark on the labor
market. In America, it looks similar to similar youth-led movements
against work in other countries, especially China, where young people
are 'lying flat' by decentering a drive to constantly be more
productive and competitive at work, and instead find happiness in
their own lives and relaxation.

A rising disillusion with the state of work has spawned millions of
Larrys over the last year. People have been quitting their jobs at
record rates for six months in a row now â€” and many aren't going
back. That's because, for some, work doesn't seem to be worth it
anymore. Wages have been on the decline for decades while student debt
rises. The number of people with low-wage jobs has grown since the
Great Recession , as salaries that support a middle-class life have
cratered"

If supply probs persist, that could be a way to encourage folks to
consume less. On wages, when similar problems surfaced during the
[70s](https://youtu.be/8rxrjhWTdv8?t=27) developed world panicked,
"went to China", production skyrocketed through slave labor, at the
same time, wages stagnated and in US ppl started dying from
opioids... Let's not repeat that mistake.  If wages increase "more
than necessary" that is an internal politics fight, and let's have it,
with trade unions, politicians etc. In the meantime cannot find a Mr
Potatohead toy? Use a potato and make one

If Oz wanted to replace coal, the coal regions (in the East, and SW)
also get good sunshine. People can easily transition to a job at a
thermosolar plant.
