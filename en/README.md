No wonder Blackrock is world's largest asset manager; LF has a good

early. That is skill.

Electric cables are an inefficient way of transporting energy. A wind
can damage the wires easily. A clean gas pipeline is very close or
under the ground, and a robust construction, would not be harmed by
adverse weather easily. Also transmits power 10 times faster at eighth
the cost.

JFK "Eternal Flame"? They have this bloody gas powered thing burning

Pollution (air, sea -oil spills-) is enough to entice a switch to
green fuels. Green fuel pipeline instead of oil pipeline would have
