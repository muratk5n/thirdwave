On this day in 1967, the United States collaborated in a coup that
deposed Sukarno, the first leader of independent Indonesia, and
replaced him with a right-wing dictatorship. US officials conspired
with the dictatorship to massacre 500,000 left-wing [Indonesians]"

Some words get thrown around too easily. Superpower? This is a country
which has a long agrarian-empire past -a negative-, did not explore as
the West did, in fact, failed to map even the mid-size landmasses near
it, missed the boat on most major tech innovations of the last 300
years.. You dont come back from that. Not e-z

One addition here; CH is [not a rising superpower](2021/03/power-of-nations-beckley.md#chsuperpower).

Now we start to see the creation of a lowflation world was a policy
choice. Creditors were happy. Businesses were happy, they could get
depressed wages through outsourcing or immigration. Through
competition the employer-state kept citizens on their toes, didn't
have to give them any benefits, in reverse, lack of benefits helped
them to import new citizens easier.

But there was trouble in paradise..  More and more money was chasing
freak investments -- just look at all the companies shorted by Michael
Burry of the *The Big Short* fame.. In what world can Shopify have a
market cap over 300 TIMES its cash flow? Only in this bizarro one.

The listed mistakes dont sound too bad. NSW vax rates were going up and
they were preparing to open up.. Pity.. 
 
The Mandarin: "Gladys Berejiklian â€” a glittering career undone by two
disastrous misjudgments"

The watchdog ICAC has some pull, eh? 

There doesnt seem to be an underhanded motive behind this, or failure
at the job. She looked like an able public servant.. Sad.

The problem is also due to Reps not being in government. If they were,
the overall message wld be different, the public wld be led
differently. Governance carries some responsibility, noone wants to be
hemmed in inane arguments. Trump was actually keeping the culture war
contained on less deadly dumb-ass shit, like masks. The followers were
being fed a culture war on that, but not on vaccines.

With that "guidance" gone, retards are running around in random
directions, "free-range", causing chaos.
