MarketWatch: "Opinion: Explaining why â€˜green hydrogenâ€™ is our best (maybe only)
option for getting to net-zero carbon by 2050 and halting climate
change"

If co2 increases are during the winter, then priority should be to fix
heating, making that process renewable.. And of course H2, NH3 are the
best solutions for that too. See CHP, Combined Heat and Power systems.

"Once it's added to the atmosphere, [carbon] hangs around, for a long
time: between 300 to 1,000 years"

Clearly the increases are due to Northern Hemisphere
winter.

Then... ðŸ¤” if everyone had a home in both hemispheres, went from one
to the other escaping colder season, there would be no CO2 increase..

Kidding

Monthly atmo carbon content [graph](2015/08/temp-increase.md#carbon).
It increases every year (except during warmer seasons when
it is flat).

Contrary to certain wisdom, co2 contentration during covid shutdowns
kept going up.

Clearly the judge was biased; not possible to request a new judge?

The [latest](2021/10/donziger-chevron.md#oct2021) on Donziger.  Poor
guy had to sit there and listen to a "federal judge compare him to a
mule who needed to be beaten with a piece of wood". This is unreal.
