H2 View: "[A new] study has found that using a [polymer based]
photocatalyst under simulated sunlight facilitates the decomposition
of water, when loaded with an iridium catalyst, which in turn
generates hydrogen. The photocatalysts.. are of huge interest as their
properties can be tuned.. The researchers have also said that another
potential advantage of this technique.. is that ‚Äòpolymers are
printable‚Äô, which would allow for cost-effective production techniques
for scaling up"

AP News: "[New] post-Brexit rules, which took effect after Britain
left the European Union, have imposed customs and border checks on
some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. The
arrangement was designed to keep an open border between Northern
Ireland and EU member Ireland, a key pillar of the peace process.

But the rules angered many [DUP members], who maintain that the new
checks have created a barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of
the U.K. that undermines their British identity. In February, the
DUP‚Äôs Paul Givan resigned as first minister in protest against the
arrangements, triggering a a fresh political crisis in Northern
Ireland"

entity. Plus now solidly in the outer alliance, they flail around
f-ing shit up everywhere appealing to some historical idea of Britain,
trying to revive 'that old good feeling'.
