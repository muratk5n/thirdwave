Economist Steve Keen: "[In his research] Bernanke was relying on the
mainstream theory that banks simply act as intermediaries between
savers and borrowersâ€”the ideas for which his.. Prize companions
Diamond and Dybvig received their share of the Bank of Sweden's loot
this year (the prize was created by and funded by the Central Bank of
Sweden, not the Nobel Foundation)...

[Bernanke said after GFC] 'And although there are a lot of Americans
who understandably think that government money would be better spent
going directly to families and businesses instead of banks â€“ "where's
our bailout?," they ask â€“ the truth is that a dollar of capital in a
bank can actually result in eight or ten dollars of loans to families
and businesses, a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a
faster pace of economic growth.'

That is the mythical 'money multiplier' model of money creation that
the Bank of England said was rubbish in 2014. But because Bernanke
believed that myth, and Obama followed his advice, the recovery from
the Global Financial Crisis was the slowest recovery from a recession
in the history of the United States. By comparison, the recovery from
the Covid recession was the fastestâ€”and then the money went straight
to the public, rather than to the banks.

For these failures, Bernanke gets the Economics Nobel"
