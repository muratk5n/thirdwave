'In practice' this means the Taliban have a lot of stuff they can’t
maintain and will be useless in 3-6 months. Best use would be a surge
of propaganda pics and then put everything but artillery, small arms,
NVDs, and pickups up for sale.

worth of lost equipment means in practice for the Taliban''

"A study has provoked controversy in Germany because it shows that the
country’s healthcare system has two tiers... The study.. has shown
that patients who have statutory health insurance have to wait about
three times longer for an appointment with a specialist than members
of private health insurance schemes"

New co-leader of Germany's left party Die Linke, talking about the
country's two-tier healthcare. It's good.. DE needs more left. There
are enough of those Washingon Consensus, centrist
types..

At certain point one has to move on.. Society cannot keep having lockdowns.

NYT: "Britain is reporting more than 30,000 new coronavirus cases a
day, but the public seems to have moved on. Experts say this could be
a glimpse into the future for other countries... [A] professor.. 'It
looks like we’re just accepting it now — that this is the price of
freedom.'... 'It’s really difficult to ask people not to mix for a
prolonged period, especially if there is no solution.'...  [A]
specialist... 'All our Covid cases are unvaccinated by choice'"

Handing over Iraq support to France? They do have a strategic interest
there.. wanting to stop refugees. Also indirectly protecting
Lebanon.. ? In reverse, they have a supply route open by sea, into
Lebanon then into Iraq.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
