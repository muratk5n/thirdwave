DW: "What is starting the fires?.. The month of July was the second
hottest ever recorded in Europe.. So while arson and natural causes
such as lightening are equally to blame for starting the fires,
extreme heat has increased their intensity and is the real culprit for
the destruction being witness across fire-hit regions"

DW: "But too often in recent years, fire events have escalated way
beyond their normal size and intensity... Devastating 2017 and 2018
wildfires claimed hundreds of lives across an area stretching from
Turkey to Spain, while countries in central and northern Europe,
including Sweden, were also scorched. Such unprecedented fire events
are inevitably linked to extreme droughts and heatwaves"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
