Turns out if there are no viewers left you cannot send them into a

Denial.. The campaign, if sustained, could put pressure on Fox News,
though critics were skeptical that a sea change was in store."

I mean this speaks to the capability of said "AI" of which there is
not much.  You can lure these things into traps with rattle drums
probably.. How bleeping dumb are they? Libcucks swoon of course at the
first sight of a bright shiny object.. These are the innovators you
deserve

Yeah that shit works brilliantly lets be scared of it.

"'Population and Income Growth.. We do not see a simple
relationship. Many countries experienced both rapid population growth
and negative changes in real per capita GDP. But still others had
relatively rapid population growth, yet they had a rapid increase in
per capita GDP"

The beef with the oppo towards left parties, e.g. Die Linke isn't
based one issue or another. It is the general stance towards
them.. They say 'see these people over there, they are *beyond the
pale*', like, not even worth to talk to. Pro-business FDP can argue
for cutting taxes in the middle of a crisis, but left cannot talk
about two-tier system in DE healthcare. That makes you some kind of
weirdo..

Wait until hospitals start denying covid patients.. Can happen right?
There are other emergencies, resources are limited, and there is now a
covid vaccine. Guy doesn't take it, gets his ass sick and shows up to
ER asking oxygen to be piped into him... Other patients need
care. Triage is a bitch.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
