For 2025 it predicts Sunni-Shite war. Not good. It is likely too,
these aren't empty predictions.

It does predict that.. It also says Charles will abdicate and the

Renewable Energy Magaine: "A report out this week from Rethink
Energy.. shows that the bulk of the effort to transport hydrogen
around the world will be split between pipelines and liquid organic
hydrogen carriers (LOHC), often transported in ships..

By 2050 [they] forecast that 735 million tons of green hydrogen will
be produced each year.. The trade routes that have long defined the
global energy map will have to be redrawn.. LOHCs â€“ with reduced
packing costs â€“ come in at between 1.48 and 1.86 USD per kilogram over
distances between 7,000 and 20,000 kilometres"

"Russia Says Production Using HTGR Could Begin In 2030.. Russia is
planning to develop a 'commercially effective' solution for the
production of green hydrogen using a high-temperature gas-cooled
reactor unit.. [VP] Anton Moskvin.. at JSC Rusatom
Overseas.. said.. at the Russian Energy Week conference [he added] a
first such facility could be in place by 2030"

Japan Forward: "[03/2022] The results of international joint testing
have proven the safety of the high-temperature gas-cooled reactor
(HTGR)... [which] proved that it would not melt down even in the event
of a total power failure... The [plant]â€™s response was
unfaltering. With only the built-in safety features [..the] reactor
shut down automatically without using control rods, and natural
cooling of the core proceeded.

In 2022, JAEA will begin designing hydrogen production equipment that
will use the near 1,000 degrees Celsius high temperature of the [the
design]. The plan is.. mass production of hydrogen that uses only
iodine, sulfur, and water, and does not emit any carbon dioxide. The
HTGR at the practical use stage would be the ultimate decarbonized
power source as it would produce green hydrogen"

Before the state creation, they asked Otto to give land for Israel -
Otto was bunch of backward Romanesque inbred boneheads but even they
smelled a problem, refused.

Israel of today continues to be a useful tool for the outer alliance,
making good use of Britain's investment in the matter.

H2 View: "One key zero-emissions product Cummins revealed at IAA is
its fourth-generation hydrogen fuel cell engine. Designed to meet the
duty-cycle, performance and packaging requirements of medium- and
heavy-duty trucks and buses, the fuel cell technology is available in
135 kW single and 270 kW dual modules"

When they say "smart", "connected", I hear "overly dependent",
"fragile".
