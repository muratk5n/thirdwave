Crawl is done; I count 4601 servers and 7,824,386 users. 3 hops were
enough, maybe we should have Three Degrees of Kevin Bacon.

Traversal wld be breadth-first, check double visit of nodes.. Iteration
count..? Probably [six is fine](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FijVyYTXoAArlYU?format=jpg&name=small).

You could write a simple "crawler" probably that can hit all MD servers
and get their info, collect it.

---

```python
response = requests.get(url) # details on specific host
res = json.loads(response.text)
res['stats'] 
```

```text
Out[1]: {'user_count': 880513, 'status_count': 43334732, 'domain_count': 35389}
```

---

All MD servers know about related servers, code below fetched that
for one machine displayed few results.

---

```python
import requests, json
url = "https://mastodon.social/api/v1/instance"
response = requests.get(url + "/peers") 
json.loads(response.text)[:4]
```

```text
Out[1]: 
['smgle.com',
 'mstdn.nielniel.net',
 'testdon00001.mamemo.online',
 'lazybear.io']
```

---

Mastodon servers have REST APIs - easy to get info... Nice.

The psyop has a rich white guy who was culturally Protestan (as most Americans are),
to be seen as first Irish-Catholic President, read: a minority who was
"representing", "taken from us much too early". Dems are made to
weep after this symbol of diversity, follow its flashy image at the
same time ensuring its centrist, rich guy policies are followed. [This photo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FimCFrjWIAMztMt?format=jpg&name=small)
has the worst and second worst US presidents of modern times in a
single frame, and that is by design.

".. ask what you can do for your country" translates to "dont ask for services
from gov" (as Markey brilliantly [used](https://youtu.be/86-3yuzn5UU?t=156) in MA
Senate race), "the rising tide lifts all boats" sounds like trickle-down economics
(in fact some of the WH advisors at the time were actual [proponents](https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-126725)
of the approach). JFK escalated the war in Vietnam, f--ked it all
up in Cuba, and somehow shifted the blame *to the media* with another
statemanly sounding proclamation. It all sounded aw so eloquent
that the retro air is what people remember fondly, rather than
the empty content of the statement itself.

---

Dems are better off wout the adulation, staning for the Kennedys, it
is holding them back. The soundbytes sound fine enough, but when you
dissect 'the legacy', there isn't much there.
