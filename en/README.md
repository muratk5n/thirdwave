"By 2004... [UN rep] Brahimi had realised that keeping the Taliban out
of the Bonn process was a mistake. In an interview in 2004, he
described it as the ‘original sin’. Result: about 48 per cent Pashtun
got some 15 percent of share in power (this excluded Taliban and their
constituencies)...

This concept of centralisation and lopsided ethnic representation also
informed the formation of [the Afghan military].. Because the force
remained ethnically fragmented, no amount of training or equipment
could induce the overall, organic tribalism that informs successful
militaries"

Most CC today is badly designed but an ideal one (like a left-wing
version of Nano) cld be basis for a new econ. The world with such
change would be drastically different. How different is different? See
the monumental shift from agrarian to industrial England. If one lived
back then, there'd come a time, within a span of ~50 yrs, before /
after of the place would look completely different. Before would be
carriages, slow life, hand-sewn clothing, after, train, steam ships,
manufactured clothing, much faster life. Radical change. Day and
night. Oil and water.

How to know a solution is 3W? Does it fit under [these](04/fundamentals-of-industrial-ideologies.md)?
If not, and new, 3W.

H2 fuel is that rare and ingenious solution.. It swaps one fuel for
another, so all kinds of distribution, central management,
concentration dynamics can apply as-is (along w people who make money
from it). At the same time, new fuels can support off-grid,
self-sustained living, see Lavo in Australia. Here renewable fuel
works for 3W.

---

Are renewable fuels a Second Wave or Third Wave development? They are
useful for both.

Soviets aren't entirely blameless either. They also contributed to
AFG's current misery in history.

Vox: "[I]n 1978, when [AFG President] Daoud Khan is formally
overthrown in what’s known as the Saur Revolution and a
Marxist-Leninist government is established...[Then] the United States
starts to slowly funnel money toward some resistance groups"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
