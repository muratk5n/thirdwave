[Baldwin] movie was financed by Bondit Media Capital, a company that
also backed Randall Emmett's "Wash Me in the River" and a host of
other cheap "geezer teasers.' It will be interesting to see whether
corner cutting played a role"

I like that everyone gets coin but it needs to happen continuously
expanding the money base, inflating away stashed wealth while
providing UBI. Also iris image capture -> id generation doesn't sound secure.

The script was written by a major scifi fan; there were references
even to SG Atlantis where Momoa played a role. In SGA JM constantly

*Dune* looked great cinematically. Acting top notch. It cld have moved
faster though and showed the events around fremen rebellion, it sort
of feels empty without that part. The 2000 miniseries did better
there.
