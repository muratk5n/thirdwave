Need a bit of GOOD news? 'A research team.. is introducing in a new
type of solar cell produced without silicon. Not only does the new
cell have extremely high efficiency and record-setting voltage, it
also bypasses the need for silicon, which is energetically costly to
produce and purify'"

WWII JP battleship Yamato was a beast; had the biggest guns. But docu
suggests its anti aircraft guns were not good, so it fell prey to
bomber planes lifting off from nearby US carrier - it sank.

The DU research shows the benefits of betting on efficient, simple,
strong base structure - H2 as medium allows further innovations
easily. 

---

The Deakin University research mentioned [previously](2022/02/h2-boron-nitrade.html)
accomplishes two things; one is to seperate crude oil gases, the other
is to capture and store H2 with boron nitrade powder. Prof Ying Chen
says the storage part will work on its own, nanopowder captures H2 and keeps it,
later heating it in vacuum releases the gas. Says they have a patent for
their process and already pursuing industrial applications for it. üëç
Whoever he is talking to (he didn't say) I'd find out and invest. Storage
is cheap, in ambient conditions, release of H2 is straightforward.

known as a kamikaze (or ‚Äúdivine wind‚Äù) ‚Äì hit the Tsushima Strait,
apparently destroying approximately 80% of his fleet."

They did a war-game recently on China-Taiwan conflict, if US were to
involved most effective US asset was long-range bomber with cruise
missiles; the bombers can be based outside of CH missile range, but
still strike at the attacking CH forces.
