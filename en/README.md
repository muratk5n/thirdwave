De-globalize. De-electrify. Hate to be the bearer of bad news.. but
MSM has been feeding people lies, faux dreams.

---

Take Germany. Their numerous *Mittelstand* the small-to-mid size
businesses represent the depth of that type of knowledge. There will
be one obscure guy producing some funky valve that noone in the world
produces. And guess what, he finds customers and can charge top dollar
(or euros). Further innovation builds on top of this diversity, if you
want to build a clean-fuel combustion engine, chances are you will
find the parts, the know-how associated with the subcomponents of that
engine.

Producing a piece, any piece of a "globalized supply chain" doesn't
necessarily get you there. Producing the cap of Coke bottles makes
country part of the supply chain but won't provide much deep
knowledge.

---

As [Hidalgo](2017/08/economic-complexity-hidalgo.html) proved,
know-how is what makes economies tick and countries to advance (not
necessarily "education" which doesn't always translate into actionable
knowledge). Hidalgo measures this through the diversity of products a
country produces, which is a sign of the depth of a country's
actionable skillset.

If China has a crisis, it will hurt for sure, but afterwards they will
still have their know-how. They built up a lot of that over the years.

Davis: "It would take a country the size of Ukraine the better part of
a decade and a massive level of support from friendly nations to
recover from the devastation the Ukraine military has already
suffered. The idea that the UAF ‚Äì or the armed forces of any nation on
earth ‚Äì can recover from the level of destruction they‚Äôve suffered to
date and rebuild the strength necessary to drive an invader out while
at the same time fighting an existential battle, is flatly
unrealistic.

Russia continues to take severe losses itself. Putin‚Äôs forces are not
immune to the consequences of losing trained and experienced
personnel, but as previously noted, Russia has millions more men from
which to draw new conscripts and hundreds of thousands of other active
troops that can be repurposed to ground combat. It is by no means
guaranteed that Russia would be able to achieve total victory over
Ukraine, but the fundamentals are present to give the idea some chance
of success. For Ukraine, however, there is minuscule chance of winning
and a higher probability of failure if they try to launch an
offensive.

An unemotional assessment of this war would lead to the conclusion
that the Ukrainian political leadership should seek the
best-negotiated settlement it could get now, while it still has
complete control of Kharkiv, Odesa, and most of Donetsk Oblast ‚Äì and
before another significant city is turned to rubble and tens of
thousands more of its citizens killed or wounded"

Al Jazeera: "Hungary‚Äôs Orban says EU sanctions on Russia have
failed.. 'A new strategy is needed which should focus peace talks and
drafting a good peace proposal ‚Ä¶ instead of winning the war,' Orban
said in a speech in Romania on Saturday... Orban said this strategy
has failed as governments in Europe are collapsing 'like dominoes',
energy prices have surged and a new strategy was needed now. He said
Ukraine will never win the war this way 'quite simply because the
Russian army has assymetrical dominance'.

Orban called for Russia and the United States to hold negotiations to
bring about an end to the war... He said 'only Russian-US talks can
put an end to the conflict because Russia wants security guarantees'
only Washington can give"
