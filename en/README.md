CNN: "Zuck is betting the future of his half-a-trillion-dollar
company, Meta, on a vision of the future in which all of us spend more
time in a virtual space known as the metaverse.. The trouble is,
everything we've seen of that future so far looks lame as hell. 'It's
genuinely puzzling that Meta spent more than $10 billion on VR last
year and the graphics in its flagship app still look worse than a 2008
Wii game,' tweeted New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose"

H2 Fuel News: "Why are fuel cell buses becoming so popular in public
transportation?.. For many routes, [HFC] buses have proven to have
considerable performance advantage over battery electrics, becoming
the top choice for the replacement of traditional diesel models. Among
the reasons for this included the advantages of zero-emission
operations without sacrificing schedules, routes or existing functions
at depots. H2 offers longer range and faster fueling than batteries"

"David Lawrence Sackett is widely regarded as 'the father of evidence
based medicine,' which is arguably the most important movement in
medicine in the past 25 years... Sackett, although at one time a
professor in Oxford, had no pomposity whatsoever. Of Oxford he said,
'They have 20 ways of saying ‚Äòinteresting,‚Äô all of them negative'"

It‚Äôs disappointing to see that many Ukrainian journalist would rather
defend each and every move of their government instead of critically
questioning its concrete actions to defend the nation.  But I guess
this is what war makes out of journalism during the threat of
extinction.

Ukrainian counter-offensive? I think they are getting their ass kicked.
It's sad to watch.

Forbes:  "A new study has estimated that life expectancy in the United
States dropped sharply between 2019 and 2021, decreasing by three
years on average, the steepest decline in nearly 100 years...

A precise accounting of the causes of this devastating development
cannot yet be made, but Dr. Steven Woolf, a co-author of the study,
attributed it broadly to ‚Äúthe U.S. health disadvantage.‚Äù¬†

The United States is over-invested in war and preparation for war, and
under-invested in measures aimed at alleviating poverty and disease,
which kill more Americans than any current or recent global conflict,
by a wide margin"

Palin was probably the first modern-day high-profile Rep to talk about
Russia without the obligatory animosity. "I can see Russia from
Alaska". She might have influenced the Trump narrative later on.. But
she was McCain's VP pick who was an extreme Russia hawk.. That was
strange.

Palin lost Alaska HoR election.. Cotton jumped to her defense

Dugina was his father's little girl wasn't she - repeated most of his
ideas.. Some of them pretty extreme, war-like. UKR probably tried to
have Dugin assasinated, they missed, got the daughter, it's sad but
these people were actively in the war in a way, through their propaganda.
