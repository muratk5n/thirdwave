Insect protein? Have insects eat food waste (before it emits methane)
and then turn insects into flour, protein powder? Interesting. First
'insect protein' is bad marketing, they should be stressing this
flour, powder thing. Technically though it is cleaner to have plant,
lab-grown meat proteins, producing massive meal replacement powders,
which by definition, will have zero or no waste. Add water through
desalination (w better, cheaper approaches), through clean prenewable
energy, we are in the green.

It isnt like "US lost and others (in the region) won" due to the
pullout. AFG neighbor countries are worried.. I was watching troop
movements (through gdelt scans), almost all surrounding countries
deployed troops to their AFG border as pullout neared. China, Russia
wld be worried extremism that can be rekindled in their own countries
through Tali. US was rendering a security service for everyone else in
the region in many ways...

A main reason for the existence of these phony US ethnic subcultures is
so that 'earlier citizens' can play *Dances with Wolves* with their
own countrymen without leaving the comfort of their home.

Yes the Berlin Wall construction took place during [his watch](2021/08/cuban-missile-crisis.md#berlin).

So many screw ups during JFK's time.. Soviets built a wall on him in
Berlin.  His Sov counterpart was constantly on his ass bcz he was
inexperienced, came across a lightweight.

[Culture](2014/06/the-culture-code.md) is received through osmosis
from the larger society around you, subconciously, before age 7. It is
not transmitted through education, ritual, or "stories". Most of the
subcultural identity assumptions are wrong. There are no "Polish",
"Italian" in US beyond the zeroth generation. There are no Turks in
Turkey.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
