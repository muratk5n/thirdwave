FGSZ: "[T]he European Hydrogen Backbone (EHB) initiative presents an
updated version of its vision for a dedicated hydrogen transport
infrastructure across Europe. The group proposes a hydrogen network of
39,700km by 2040, with further growth expected after 2040. This grid
connects 21 European countries"

Bloomberg: "Kuwait Seeks to Invest $750 Million in Pakistan
Projects.. [A Kuwait company].. and Pakistan [KIC] have applied for a

Upstream: "BP is making steady progress with plans to produce
renewable fuels and green hydrogen at a former oil refinery site in
Kwinana, Western Australia... [Justin Nash, Senior Mgr says] 'We're
targeting some of the best use cases for hydrogen, and that's places
where it’s used today, industrial processes feedstock for chemicals,
opportunities for decarbonised heat and energy that's currently being
fulfilled by natural gas,” Nash explained. Transport, heavy duty long
haul municipal fleets, waste trucks, community buses are all potential
transport demand sources. And then with Kwinana’s access to fantastic
pipeline infrastructure will have the opportunity to support WA’s
target of 10% hydrogen blending [in the state’s gas grid] by 2030'"

That was shared as a 'pessimistic forecast' because it would be, for
homeowners?

Fin Anchor, ABC Oz: "Reserve Bank put out a forecast stating that if
they were to lift rates by 2%, then it could lead a 15% in drop on
property prices over a few years"

That crowd is bunch of empire- self-serving gaslighters. They dont
care about liberty, or free speech, all they care about is gaining
influence to do their weirdo shit.

Caitlin Johnstone: "MintPress News happens to have published critical
journalism about PayPal itself in the past, like the articles it
published in 2018 by Whitney Webb documenting the way shady
PayPal-linked billionaires Peter Thiel and Pierre Omidyar have
advanced the interests of the US empire and facilitated imperial
narrative control, or [how] from 2016 on how the company blocks
Palestinians from opening accounts while showing no such bias against
illegal Israeli settlers"

Arab Nationalism could be a threat for France I guess through Algeria,
Morocco, so they wanted it 'handled' through Israel.

The National News: "Israel had long wanted a nuclear weapon of its
own, but was isolated diplomatically in the years after its founding
in 1948. But by the mid-1950s, that had changed. Western powers were
so concerned at the rise of Arab nationalism, and in particular the
leadership of Gamal Abdel Nasser, that they conspired in 1956 to use
Israel to attack Egypt and bring down Nasser. That plan failed, but it
began a long association between the West and Israel.

It was France, in particular, enraged by the failure in 1956, that
began building Israel’s bomb. By the end of the 1950s, there were
hundreds of French scientists and technicians living in Dimona,
teaching Israelis how to master the nuclear fuel cycle..

In the years since, the Israelis openly lied to the United States
during inspections, supported brutal regimes like Apartheid South
Africa in order to get its hands on materials, conducted test
explosions in violation of international treaties, spied on allies and
censored the press at home. When a disgruntled technician, Mordechai
Vanunu, told the world Israel had nuclear weapons in 1986, he was
drugged by Israeli agents, kidnapped and jailed for nearly 20 years
after a secret trial"

China-Pakistan nuke share is widely known. France-Israel rel is
interesting.. What did FR have to gain from that?

---

From an earlier share on nuke tech; Russia gave nuke tech to China and
India. Some look for RU-CH rivalry, but when RU could withhold one of
the most destructive weapons ever invented by mankind, they didn't
even blink and chose to share - just gave it away to those two
countries. RU,CH,IN, likely feel more threathened from outside than
inside, instinctively untrusting towards outer countries.. That nuke
share needs to figure into every analysis on the region.
