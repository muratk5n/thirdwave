construction this month"

H2 View: "UAE, Germany strengthens hydrogen collaboration with several
key strategic partnership agreements.. The UAE has received a boost to
its hydrogen ambitions with ADNOC securing several strategic
partnership agreements with leading German hydrogen companies"

H2 View: "Thyssenkrupp Steel partners with STEAG to integrate hydrogen into
‚ÄòEurope‚Äôs largest‚Äô steelmaking site"

H2 View: "The University of Sydney‚Äôs (UNSW) SMaRT Centre has found
that coffee could provide a means to produce hydrogen instead of coke
and coal for green steel... Coffee, rubber, and plastic all can be
broken down to generate hydrogen within the process and thus can
substitute coke and coal, two carbon intensive ingredients, to provide
a clean variant of steel"

---

H2 View: "Green hydrogen prize is huge for Middle East if strategic
hub approach is adopted.. Momentum is building to scale up green
hydrogen production in the Middle East..  to support industrial
decarbonisation and create a new export economy..

The UAE‚Äôs Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure chose COP26 in Glasgow
as the launchpad for its Hydrogen Leadership Roadmap. And earlier this
month one of its senior officials said hydrogen will be ‚Äòcrucial to
decarbonise industries, transportation, and the fossil fuel sector.‚Äù..

There is clear evidence across the region of buy-in to hydrogen‚Äôs
potential, epitomised by Saudi Arabia‚Äôs stated aim of becoming a
leading global supplier of hydrogen. Plans are already in motion for a
multi-billion dollar production plant in the country‚Äôs north western
region, with a daily production target of 650 tonnes of green
hydrogen, planned to be on stream by 2026"

H2 View: "The heat waves of today would be laughable compared to those
in a 2050 Earth in which climate change efforts have not been made in
any way"

WSJ: "Hong Kong eases quarantine amid angst over ‚Äòzero COVID‚Äô isolation"

---

At a very coarse level (and that is all they see) people must be
seeing 'potus wanted something not done, it was done'. Simple
really. Bada bing, bada boom. Wanted no bada boom, but there was bada
boom.

Most of that brief uptick is now gone \#netapprov \#biden

The Independent: "Former president vows 2024 return to White House"

Al Jazeera: "US sends Patriot interceptors to Saudi to ease tensions"

Outers are feverishly trying to peel off some inners to entice them to
join their side.

"In what has been perceived as a historic move, Australia has
repatriated 29 antiques to India"

WION: "EU aims to form a rapid reaction force.. US-led military
alliance NATO has for decades provided the bedrock for European
defence and the war in Ukraine has reinforced the instinct among many
EU members to keep Washington close.. But there has also been a push
led by France for the bloc to bolster its own capacity to act. The new
strategy is designed to strike that balancing act while boosting
defence cooperation between EU states"

---

Daily Mail: "Missile attack on Ukrainian military base launched after
Russian troops hacked into British phones.. As a result, Kremlin
agents were able to confirm the presence of former British servicemen
on the massive base ‚Äî and choose which buildings to hit"

---

The uber-antagonism backfired. Russians are now gunning for your ass,
in a recent UKR attack they specifically chose buildings so they could
smoke out Brits. See above.

---

Remember the July 2021 [event](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/world/europe/russia-uk-destroyer-crimea.html).
It was just bizarre.. 

Kinda like [this move](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FOY3EccX0AQuQqa?format=jpg&name=small).

But Putin isn't impressed, guy doesn't f--k around.

UK was part of the inners (the EU), but left it due to a stupid choice
(that's what you get when you ask 'people' on policy) and naturally
became part of the 'outer belt'. The recent Johnson
[comment](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-60809454) on UKR/Brexit
makes this clear; in the Brexiter mind these two issues are linked,
not in the way BJ expressed obviously, but in a larger sense,
exclusively being in that alliance forced them to be a "good soldier",
extremely pro-Ukraine for it that was unavoidable after Brexit.

---

Japan has been the ultimate "money guy" for the group. They picked up
the tab for the entire Iraq war effort (the first one).

---

Japan after giving up on its imperial ambitions became a pacified part
of the 'outers'. They are a recent addition to the Five Eyes network
too actually (I guess now the org is Six Eyes).

---

Wapo: "[After little job-well-done, pat in the back, the inevitable
'but' arrives here] Finally, the Western democracies need to think about
how the war ends. While the ideal outcome would be a complete defeat
for Putin and a humiliating withdrawal of all his forces from Ukraine,
that appears unlikely ‚Äî especially given the nuclear arsenal with
which Russia can in effect blackmail the world.

Here the lesson of the Russo-Finnish War is that a diplomatic
compromise may be necessary.¬†Ukraine may have to provide a guarantee
of neutrality and agree to give up some of the territory that is
already de facto in the hands of Russia: Crimea and the Donbas region
in the east"

WSJ: "As global brands shun Russia, Asian firms sit out controversy"

Arab News: "‚ÄòWhat I saw, I hope no one will ever see‚Äô says Greek
diplomat returning from Mariupol"

ISW: "The Ukrainian General Staff reported for the first time that the
Kremlin is preparing its population for a 'long war' in Ukraine"
