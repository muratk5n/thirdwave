Freight Waves: "The first day of the [the annual energy conference]
CERAWeek.. meeting in Houston, which has an attendance of a staggering
7,500 delegates, featured hydrogen talk across numerous
presentations. And the consistent theme throughout the day Monday was
that the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed last August by
President Biden, has placed the hydrogen industry in the U.S. in a
warp speed gear"

Yahoo News: "Zelensky warned in an interview with CNN what could
happen if Bakhmut falls to Russian forces. 'We understand that after
Bakhmut, (Russian forces) could go further' and attack nearby cities
in the Donetsk region. 'They could go to Kramatorsk, they could go to
Sloviansk, it would be an open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to
other towns in Ukraine, in the Donetsk direction,' Zelensky said in an
interview"

RU could be aiming for the bigger cauldron, not just the Bakhmut one,
there is movement towards Chasiv Yar, and the claim is
Orikhovo-Vasylivka is also under attack or taken. UA keeps sending
reinforcements to the area so they can end up with a huge number of
people trapped in that larger cauldron.
