"Toyota is getting ready to test its hydrogen combustion engine on the
streets..  The flexibility to utilize current internal combustion
engine technologies, rapid refueling times, and a pronounced decrease
in the use and requirement of materials with finite supplies like
lithium and nickel are some of the main advantages of hydrogen
combustion. Hydrogen combustion could result in broad, affordable
carbon-reduction solutions more quickly by modifying current
technologies and maximizing current investments"
