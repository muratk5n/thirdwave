H2 View: "easyJet: Hydrogen flights canâ€™t come soon enough.. 'When
we.. looked back a few years ago, we realised clearly that the climate
emergency is coming our way and that we needed to address our
sustainability issue â€“ and we knew that our passengers care about that
as well..

It was about the time when we started to see the first electric cars,
the Tesla vehicles were being invented, and there was expectation that
everything would go electric. However, once we got into the detail and
the physics and the science behind electric, it became clear that
battery-powered aeroplanes were not going to have sufficient energy
density to power a large commercial aircraft'"

end up doing it all

H2 View: "Transitus Energy has received new funds that will enable the
company to scale its operations in the UK and Thailand in order to
support the production of blue hydrogen... Jack Peck, CEO of Transitus
Energy, said, 'Hydrogen will be our best chance of reaching Net Zero
carbon targets, because hydrogen decarbonises those parts of the
economy that electrification cannot meet. Hydrogen is especially
suitable for domestic and industrial heating, long distance
transportation, industrial manufacturing, shipping, air travel, and
power balancing'"

CNBC: "German power firm RWE has signed an agreement with Neptune
Energy to develop a green hydrogen demonstration project in the Dutch
North Sea, targeting an electrolyzer capacity of 300 to 500
megawatts.. [and use an] existing pipeline used to funnel the hydrogen
to shore. The pipelineâ€™s capacity ranges between 10 to 12 gigawatts,
the companies said.

'The energy transition can be faster, cheaper and cleaner if we
integrate existing gas infrastructure into new systems,' Lex de Groot,
who is managing director of Neptune Energy in the Netherlands, said"

Offshore is too risky. Am fine with fossil as long as wildlife is not
harmed. For NG, no flaring, no fracking. 

"[Haaland's DOI's] highest-profile action so far has been
Novemberâ€™sÂ auctionÂ of oil and gas drilling leases in the Gulf of
Mexico, the largest in the Gulfâ€™s history, justified by spurious
logic. The department claimed it was compelled, hands tied, to hold
the sale due to an earlier court ruling that reversed theÂ pause on new
drilling permitsÂ on public lands in the Gulf. In August, a memo filed
by the Department of Justice contradicted that assertion, finding that
the government was not, in fact, forced to issue new permits...

Among those top-level aides is David Hayes, special assistant to the
president for climate policy. A BigLaw alum from the firm Latham &
Watkins, Hayes first served under Bill Clintonâ€™s interior secretary,
Bruce Babbitt, and then eventually as the Senate-confirmed deputy
secretary of the interior under Clinton. After spending the Bush years
at Latham, he returned [to the department... ] where he was the deputy
secretary of the DOI [.. during] the Deepwater Horizon spill"

Most of the leaks are at end-user and transmission level. Regulation
can clamp down on the source easily, the rest is very hard as we found
out during the Volkswagen emission cheating scandal.

MLK and Mohammad Ali were polar opposites; one for integration, one
for segregation (yes there were non-whites for segregation). They were
apparently good friends behind the scenes, wasn't known at the time.

MLK never [talked about tolerence](https://youtu.be/5mKCqVRDTuI?t=224).

Whenever I hear "toleration" it sounds like ghetto toleration to me..

Many think relating to minorities should be like interacting with
alien species.. They like to play *Dances with Wolves* with "foreign
cultures", so they try create foreigners from Wakanda, "African
Americans" in their own countries, not humans just like them who
happens to be a visually different. They want cultural ghettos they
can peek into and tell their friends about to prove how cool they are.
