"Now, backed by industry partnerships, new legislation, an eye-popping
$7 billion in federal funds for regional clean hydrogen hubs (H2Hubs),
a new draft strategy, and on-site progress to pair electrolyzers with
nuclear plants, the potential for nuclear-powered production of clean
hydrogen is clearer than ever.

In August, DOE-NE’s Light Water Reactor Sustainability (LWRS) program,
in coordination with the HFTO, offered between 20 million and 40
million USD in cost-shared funding to support the demonstration of an
'energy park' drawing 20–300 MW of thermal energy from a U.S. nuclear
power plant. That funding would tackle the design of the
heat-extraction infrastructure needed use high-temperature steam from
existing LWRs to produce hydrogen using high-temperature electrolysis
“in preparation for future scale-up of industrial use of nuclear
energy.” Proposals were invited both for the engineering and design
work needed to extract steam from a nuclear power plant, termed
'Nuclear Plant Thermal Integration'"

Where am I getting the frontline raw data? U dont wanna know.

In the weeds of f-ing kmz, kml files..

According to [War Mapper](https://twitter.com/War_Mapper) UA is making
some gains towards Svatove in the north (old frontline is green). Also
gains in Kherson along the river.. reportedly RU defensive line pulled
back to Novokeiry. These arent bad gains - strictly looking at before
and after.

```python
# bakhmut, svatove, novokeiry

One method "perturbs" initial point and see how widely it changes the
future, does that many times, if outcome lands on certain prediction
over and over again, that increases confidence. Can also construct a
likelihood range around the prediction from many runs.

---

As in life, some outcomes are more likely than others, there are ways
to compute those and report likely events.

"If weather systems are chaotic, ie later outcome depends on minor
changes today (which can never be accurately measured) how can we make
accurate weather predictions?"
