This electrification business is a complete racket. Fish bait for
idiots.

---

Lithium? You have to drive the electric car for two years before it
offsets the CO2 emitted while digging up, preparing its lithium. And
that's just the lithium. 

---

Natgas emissions 400 g CO2 / kWh. After 95% capture (which can
actually go even higher for natgas) the result is 20 g CO2 / kwh which
makes it nearly twice better than solar panels.

---

How to compare CO2 emissions from solar (yes there is some) vs fossil taking
into account the entire lifetime? [This paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1530-9290.2011.00439.x)
puts that value at around 55 g / kwh thorughout the lifetime of a solar panel
(there is massive carbon emitted while producing the panel).

For coal that value is 1011 g CO2 / kWh. But once CCS is factored in,
assuming 95% is captured, lifetime emission of coal falls to 50 g /
kwh. Meaning, coal + CCS is cleaner than solar panels.

Simulation is done with a software called Aspen Plus. Click and the
plant would calculate its internal parameters.. Fantastic.

I've seen a few books that use direct Python programming too which
obviously jives with my toolset.

The professor I talked to on Coal-CCS sent me bunch of links, among
them is an industrial plant simulation file for blue hydrogen
production. The tech exists.

I bet this guy mixed up electricity with total energy like most of his

Norway's renewable energy comprises 50% of is consumption. But even if
they didn't have that, NW has huge oil and gas reserves.

I'm not sure why Ukraine MPs input matters, they are not part of NATO
(hence the pickle they are in). Right on a likely French veto.. If the
trouble triggered by UK/US meddling is any guide, a new head from an
outer alliance country would cause nothing but more trouble, would be
against the interests of Europe, France.

That would be hilarious..

Hopefully the RU debacle strengthens parties not antagonistic toward
Russia going forward... I remember in one German debate before last
election Janine Wissler from Die Linke said some supportive words in
that vein and boy, was she gazed upon as some kind of freak weirdo by
most others in that panel.

Davis: "[In Ukraine] Most Likely Scenario (Collapse of Western
Support).. Without remarkable levels of financial and military support
from Western countries, Russia might well have conquered far more
territory, and far faster, than it already has. Moscow might have even
forced an end-of-war settlement on Kyiv by now...

Most Western countries have a reflexive opposition to Russia. They
regard Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine with a combination of anger, fear,
and for some, hatred. All Western governments believe that Moscow’s
invasion was illegal and unjustified, and they want Putin to fail. But
each nation is also primarily concerned about its own national
security and interests. That self-interest balances their desire for
Russian failure. They do not want their support to cross a line and
draw them into conflict with Russia...

An additional and often overlooked factor is that some Western
governments view the threat of a conventional attack from Moscow to be
negligible. They have given minimal support – enough to be seen as
“doing something,” yet not enough to risk harming their own militaries
or their own economies, or to risk being dragged into the conflict
themselves...

Already the economies of the West are showing signs that a recession
is coming. In part as a result of massive sanctions levied on Russia,
gasoline prices have risen to historic highs, global food supplies
have risen to near crisis-levels (raising the price of nearly all
groceries), and inflation in the U.S. and UK remains at a four-decade
high. But the gas situation in Europe may prove to be the trigger for
a retrenchment of Western support to Ukraine..

The populations of Germany, Italy, France, Spain, and other Western
European nations, however, recognize there is effectively *no*
conventional threat to them from Moscow. Why, they will begin asking
with increasing stridency, should they sacrifice their own economic
security, struggle to put food on their tables, and scramble to heat
their homes during winter so that their governments can support
Ukraine in a war that is not necessary for European security?..

Actually according to analysis Russia did not structure its modern
military assuming it will always have air superiority, quite the
reverse. They watched Desert Storm, and other US, NATO interventions,
the lessons they learned from that was air superiority is not
guaranteed, hence the investment in air defense, the most notable
being the S-series SAM tech.
