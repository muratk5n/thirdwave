Math can deal with infinities but particles aren't infinite. There's
just a lot of them. Dealing with infinitesimals help with certain
stuff but they are by no means the true reflection of the underlying
mechanics.  It's all an approximation at the end of the day. God does
not need math, we do.

"Math and physics work bcz both are based on the many small particles"

But the nepotism charge is warranted; the familial relation puts you
further ahead among advisers, they're supposed to be equals but
the relative becomes more equal among equals. I dont think that's good.

Rubin, Summers got burned 

"During the 1992 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Bill
Clinton had talked tough on China—at one point accusing George
H. W. Bush, then president, of cozying up to 'the butchers of
Beijing.' In his confirmation hearings Warren Christopher, Clinton’s
choice for secretary of state, served notice that he would take a
tough line with China. So, in a move that the Chinese later dubbed
'the Clinton coup,' China’s top diplomats developed warm relations
with two of Clinton’s top economic advisers, Robert Rubin and Larry
Summers, who were more sympathetic to China, and worked through them
to persuade Clinton to dial back his antagonism. The Chinese had used
the same tactic during the Bush and Obama administrations, and they
had largely succeeded" \#Kush

Environment issues aren't just theoretical for many countries 

"When we arrived in Beijing [2017 visit], the city glistened in the
reflection of the pure blue sky. At the command of the Chinese
Communist Party, the coal-burning power plants and factories had been
shut down for the three weeks leading up to our visit to allow the
smog and soot to dissipate" \#Kush
