I have found the Fediverse remarkable low stress and peaceful so
far. I feel that I am able to give strangers the benefit of the doubt
and it seems to be working out shockingly well"

It sounds like the invention can help massively increase CSP output;
an interesting combo btw panels and solar concentration.

Science Daily: "A new kind of solar panel, developed at the University
of Michigan.. represents a major leap in the technology, nearly 10
times more efficient than solar water-splitting experiments of its
kind... The outstanding result comes from two advances. The first is
the ability to concentrate the sunlight without destroying the
semiconductor that harnesses the light... the second is using both the
higher energy part of the solar spectrum to split water and the lower
part of the spectrum to provide heat that encourages the reaction. The
magic is enabled by a semiconductor catalyst that improves itself with
use, resisting the degradation that such catalysts usually experience
when they harness sunlight to drive chemical reactions"

Bunch of jagoffs had taken the Prize earlier in physics for QED ðŸ‘Ž and
another guy for renormalization - the trick used to sweep infinities
under the rug.

It's sad..

The econ guy shouldn't even be there his Prize isn't Nobel

The unit they showed was from Treadwell. Those guys have the know-how
to use seawater efficiently. They can use that know-how for H2
generation on land.

When subs need air what do they use? Electrolysis, of course!
Electrolysis of water generates hydrogen **and** oxygen. Saw in a sub
docu.

Maybe they'll find one that will eat coronaviruses one day

New Atlas: "First 'virovore' discovered: An organism that eats
viruses... '[viruses are] made up of really good stuff: nucleic acids,
a lot of nitrogen and phosphorous,' said [researcher]. 'Everything
should want to eat them'. ... And sure enough, one particular microbe
seemed to be snacking on the viruses â€“ a ciliate known as Halteria"

Tryptophan also makes serotonin so it helps making ppl feel good, not
full. The ep could've used that, maybe in the next one where Opposite
George is all happy because of the turkey.

"Tryptophan in turkey gained some notoriety, thanks to an iconic
Thanksgiving episode of the sitcom 'Seinfeld' as the chemical that
makes people tired after eating. The actual truth is people tend to
get tired after a Thanksgiving meal because they generally eat a lot
of food in one sitting"

The collection of the crime data wasn't easy, had to hit the API for
each PD, one by one. A single API call for a summary could be
better. The calls that return bigger results have bizarre paging
issues. If FBI needs it I could give them a few pointers.
