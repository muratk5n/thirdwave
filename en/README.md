UP Jobs News: "Gas Networks Ireland joins major European hydrogen
project.. The European Hydrogen Backbone initiative is focused on
planning for the future development of a European hydrogen market
through new pan-European hydrogen transport infrastructure.

Five large-scale pipeline corridors are envisaged. These new corridors
will initially connect domestic local hydrogen supply and demand in
Europe, before expanding and connecting European regions amongst each
other, and then connecting neighbouring regions with hydrogen export
potential... The planned backbone network will largely be based on
repurposing existing natural gas infrastructure.

Gas Networks Ireland’s director.. David Kelly [says] 'Mapping the five
corridors in the new pan-European backbone will create more certainty
about the deployment of this new hydrogen infrastructure.. [T]he need
for hydrogen pipeline transport in the future European energy system
is clear"

Neolib econ was more of a "trickle-up economy".. The gov funded
research, cheap credit, cheap global labor, commodity hardware, free
software created conditions for money flowing towards the top, from
the base. Not a mere trickle either, it was a flood.

Why is Facebook Gross Margin Profit over 80% noteworthy? My friend,
that is a crazy number. Let's remember the Buffett criteria.. 20% is
ok, 40% great. This is over *eighty percent*. If you farted into a
bottle and sold it as a new fragrance you could not reach that
number. The bottling cost would kill you. But Big Tech just shifts
some bits around, builds on a monopoly position, uses open-source
*free* software, and commodity hardware in the backend - voila! Money
pours down like rain.

Also now the war + sanctions..

IMF: "Why inflation is high and whether it will persist is a topic of
active debate..

First, supply chain bottlenecks: The pandemic had two separate effects
on global supply chains. In the early phase, lockdowns and mobility
restrictions led to severe disruptions in various supply chains,
causing short-term supply shortages... In the later stage of the
pandemic, however, various supply chain bottlenecks have emerged as a
result of strong overall demand from the economic recovery, the sharp
increase in relative demand for durable goods..

Second, a shift in demand toward goods and away from services: The
pandemic brought about an initial significant shift in what consumers
buy; spending on goods rose dramatically. Consequently, much of the
rise in inflation in the near term reflected inflation in durable
goods (including used cars), while service inflation increased only
moderately...

[Third] Households were running down the savings they had
accumulated earlier in the pandemic (including from the stimulus and
transfers), which led to a surge in aggregate demand and a
stronger-than-expected economic recovery.

Fourth, a shock to labor supply: Labor market disruptions from the
pandemic continue even two years after it began. Labor supply
participation remains below pre-pandemic levels in several
countries. Among advanced economies, the impact has been relatively
larger in the United States, where participation is about 1.5 percent
lower than before the pandemic (about 4 million fewer workers)"
