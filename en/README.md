Calling a function instead of passing the function pointer.. rookie
`multiprocessing` mistake. `Pool(func(arg1,arg2))` instead of
`Pool(func,args=(arg1,arg2))`.. Tsck, tsck, tsck.. Then programmer
wonders why everything is running serially not paralel. You paralized
the mufucka that's why.

H2 Central: "[H2] has potential as a source for electricity in our
homes: South Korea opened a hydrogen fuel cell plant last year—the
world’s largest—that will supply power to 250,000 households
annually... In Japan.. there are 400,000 residential fuel cell units
helping to power individual homes"

"@MazzucatoM

When [the] @WIRED ⁩piece was written, capitalism still had (weak)
legs. Now it’s looking for crutches. No better time than this to
rethink fundamentals"

Wired: "What.. infuriated [the economist] Mazzucato was the prevailing
narrative that such cuts were necessary to boost competitiveness and
innovation... 'There was this belief that we didn’t have European
Googles and Facebooks because we didn’t subscribe to Silicon Valley’s
free market approach. It was just ideology: there was no free market
in Silicon Valley.'..

[Mazzucato researched the issue]. The development of Google’s search
algorithm, for instance, had been supported by a grant from the
National Science Foundation, a US public grant-awarding body. Electric
car company Tesla initially struggled to secure investment until it
received a 465 million USD loan from the US Department of Energy. In
fact, three companies founded by Elon Musk — Tesla, SolarCity and
SpaceX — had jointly benefited from nearly $4.9 billion in public
support of various kinds [clearly a giant waste of money]. Many other
well-known US startups had been funded by the Small Business
Innovation Research programme, a public venture capital fund. 'It
wasn’t just early research, it was also applied research, early stage
finance, strategic procurement,' she says. 'The more I looked, the
more I realised: state investment is everywhere.'"
