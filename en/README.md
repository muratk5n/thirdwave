Reuters: "Spain, Portugal and France said on Thursday they will build
a sea-based pipeline to carry hydrogen and gas between Barcelona and
Marseille, substituting plans to extend the so-called MidCat pipeline
across the Pyrenees that France opposed.

The route, dubbed BarMar, will mainly be used to pump green hydrogen
and other renewable gases but will also temporarily allow for the
transportation of a "limited amount" of natural gas to help alleviate
Europe's energy crisis, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said"

"Biohydrogen is H2 that is produced biologically..The biological
hydrogen production with algae is a method of photobiological water
splitting which is done in a closed photobioreactor based on the
production of hydrogen as a solar fuel by algae. Algae produce
hydrogen under certain conditions. In 2000 it was discovered that if
C. reinhardtii algae are deprived of sulfur they will switch from the
production of oxygen, as in normal photosynthesis, to the production
of hydrogen'

requires a static farmer to tax. Agro started around the Medi, so
their kingdoms are the oldest.

To the contrary, pre-agriculture free speech was our default
setting. People keep forgetting there were humans before towns, kings,
farming and armies, before "civilization". We've lived that way for
300K years, only for 10K in comparison as villagers, near domesticated
plants and animals.

"@hankgreen

[I]t should maybe be said that [free speech] is all brand new and no
human (or human institution) has ever dealt with anything like it
before, so I'm not surprised that we're bad at it and don't know what
to do"

There was a rumor a week ago a coup was attempted on Zee Ping Ping,
most air traffic over China was stopped, Xi wasnt heard from.. The
attempt clearly didn't work, and the rumor said Hu was behind it; so
during the CCP conference Xi had him thrown out, as a punishment. That
is the claim anyway.

Where would we rewind fundamental phy, before it was fucked up beyond
