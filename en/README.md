That would be 1.3 gboe (giga barrels of oil equivalent). They seem to
find the biggest fields away from the Northern part of the island
where homie lives. Cyprus per history, is divided into two, Greek vs
homie

"[2019] The well, located in Block 10 [near Cyprus], encountered a
gas-bearing reservoir..  Based on preliminary interpretation of the
well data, the discovery could represent an in-place natural gas
resource of approximately 5 trillion to 8 trillion cubic feet"

Otto was done-in by inter-wave conflict; second-wave industrial vs

'Cob' as in corn on the cock 

---

Pre-modern agro implies certain lifestyle; staticity, relationship
with the goat (let's define "what 'is' is" kind of relationship)
worshipping ancestors, and of course they were driven to sacrifice the
odd human here and there. These were feudal cobsuckers. Then they
would be run over by an empire like the Romans, Otto (there is always
a bigger cobsucker) and this pattern would continue for centuries.

---

All agro societies had sacrifices, it comes with the territory,
or.. the material "superstructure" - see [Morris](2017/10/wtwrfn-foragers-farmers.md#eastwest).

BEVs are also an ineffective, retarded midway creations right? They
exist at the intersection of the wall plug and the auto
vehicle. Mostly cheered by white-collar office dwelling Dem limpdicks
whose view of the "outside" never goes beyond that wall plug, a
bastardized product was popularized which is the battery-electric
car. Electricity transmission is not efficient, refueling, sorry
'recharging', certainly isn't - but a certain crowd likes these
half-way, co-existing solution-looking non-solutions, and the world,
econ can pay a huge price for it.

Canceling the student debt this once is fine; before changing the system.
It will play well with the electorate. People are pretty stupid on
politics but they understand the difference between 'have money in pocket'
vs 'have no money in pocket'

---

Don't butt in the market mechanism, in a mishmash way; no more gov
backed loans for anything. Private schools can be mandated to accept a
certain percentage tuition-free (not through a grant, or scholarship),
those seats would essentially be completely outside the market
structure.  Clear-cut division. Bizarre interaction with the market
will backfire, or will sadly fall short (Obamacare, Fannie-Freddie,
tuition crisis).

Bingo - Sallie Mae, founded in the 70s

Forbes: "Congress also created a new entity, Sallie Mae, with the
right to borrow at rock-bottom interest rates. Such a creature was
unprecedented: until then, only the United States government could
borrow so cheaply. In an eerie foreshadowing of the subprime mortgage
crisis, Sallie Mae flooded banks with cheap cash, purchasing student
loans directly or lending to banks using student loans as
collateral. The system gave banks the incentive—and the ability—to
make as many student loans as possible...

Everyone involved—from politicians to banks to universities—convinced
themselves they were heroes. It’s true that the convoluted system
enabled many young people of limited means to attend college. But at
the same time, student loan defaults soared. So did college tuition"

Er no, I dont think RR is the primary culprit here

CNBC: "Reagan cut higher education funding and student aid, and
college costs boomed as a result. "

---

If making it easier to 'afford' something blows up its price, where
else can we such effects? College tuition prices are through the roof;
and voila - look at outstanding student debt (also at stratospheric
levels)
