H2 View: "Cummins to purchase rights in Westport Fuel Systems joint
venture and bolster hydrogen capabilities"

What is the current RU natgas export (to EU) shortfall? 20%? Lower?

From UK we know blending 20% H2 into existing natural gas pipeline
works. If the tech were ready that would fix gas shortfall. Blending
wld automatically increase supply. For gaps <20% blend 20%, done. No
change in infra needed.

Of course additional H2 needs to be generated for blending, not
available yet -- the crisis came too early.

To repeat - countries can receive huge ship traffic. 837 crude oil
tankers arrived at Japanese ports in year 2010

translating into 2-3 ships arriving every day.

Not that China is a superpower or anything.. But it is at least a
France, which is in G7.

Post WWII is weird.. Germany isnt in the UNSC. China isn't in G7.

Would any authoritarian gov change the ending of M4? Why bother..? The
ending is for weak-ass Holywood shitlibs, they are just flying around
enjoying their airheaded 'inclusion'. Harmless.

The Matrix 4 ending was weak, scared and abysmal. *Fight Club* got it
right.. That was one courageous, fantastic movie, from start to
finish.

NYT: â€˜Fight Clubâ€™ Ending Is Restored in China After Censorship
Outcry.. Last month, viewers noticed that the ending of the 1999 film
had been replaced with a pro-government message. Now the ending is
back, and the message is gone.

I hope they do. Such simpleton, trinket products. Just plain IT.

Stronger unions gives the left better institutional muscle 4
politics. Can't have bunch of random people running around jumping up
and down 'protesting', dancing on TikTok and hope there'll be a
change. Organization, leadership is key.

Politico: "Biden wants more U.S. students to become butchers"

Warning against the military-industrial complex: Eisenhower - GOP.

---

Anti-trust isn't just for better capitalism, also for the power
dynamic between gov and biz. Reagan was GOP, but had to be cognizant
of the fact that in order to govern, can't get overrun by monopoly
power.


---

Wld expect the Dems to be more hawkish on anti-trust, but no..  After
RR not only did they let existing monopolies fester, they gave rise to
new ones. So called libertarians either watched like a gaping fish, or
generated some junk culture war material for Reps to use while
weaseling their way in to give their billionaire friends cover.

---

Anti-trust could be a Republican thing.. if you are pro-business,
especially pro **small** business, conservatives can go there.. Ronald
Reagan broke up AT&T.
