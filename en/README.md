Let's not forget it was Nixon who ended the war in Vietnam, not JFK.

---

That's interesting take on guerilla wars.

Nixon: "[First Press Conf, 1969, answering the question 'do you
consider it possible to have a cease-fire in Vietnam so long as the
Vietcong still occupy Vietnamese territory?]'

I think that it is not helpful in discussing Vietnam to use such terms
as 'cease-fire' because cease-fire is a term of art that really has no
relevance, in my opinion, to a guerrilla war. When you are talking
about a conventional war, then a cease-fire agreed upon by two parties
means that the shooting stops. When you have a guerrilla war, in which
one side may not even be able to control many of those who are
responsible for the violence in the area, the cease-fire may be
meaningless"

Concept of lift makes sense from Newton's third law viewpoint. Coanda
effect can be useful for explaining why flow sticks to airfoil in
certain parts, but in context of helping downward deflection, not as
some magical invisible lift force on its own. And that Bernoulli stuff
is just pure bullshit.

Integrated Kinetic Energy

"Despite similar landfall locations, [hurricanes] Ian and Charley were
different in a couple of notable ways. First, Ian exhibited a much
larger wind field and radius of maximum winds. Consequently, Ian’s
maximum integrated kinetic energy (IKE) – a metric designed to convey
the destructive potential of a windstorm – was more than four times
that of Charley (46 terajoules - TJ to 10 TJ)... Second, Ian tracked
much more slowly across Florida after landfall compared to Charley,
amplifying the effects of wind and water"

Those levels 3,4,5 are not a good indicator of destructive strength. IKE
is better.
