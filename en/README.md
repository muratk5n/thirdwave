If coal gasification can generate natural gas feed into methane pyrolysis,
generate clean gas.

H2 Central: "Monolith, a global leader in clean hydrogen, carbon black
and ammonia, announced its latest investment round of more than $300
million..

Monolith cleanly produces essential materials including hydrogen and
carbon black by utilizing an innovative and proprietary breakthrough
in commercial-scale methane pyrolysis, and was the first
U.S. manufacturer to produce clean hydrogen using methane pyrolysis at
scale.

This innovation attracted worldwide attention, prompting organizations
like SK to sign a memorandum of understanding last October with
Monolith to produce clean hydrogen and carbon black in South Korea. It
also generated a collaboration agreement and letter of intent with The
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company late in 2021...

The company has attracted the interest of numerous high-profile clean
energy investors and recently received conditional approval for a more
than $1 billion loan from the Department of Energy Loan Programs
Office to expand its production facilities in Nebraska"

H2 View: "CMIC delivered its hydrogen compressor package to enter the booming
hydrogen refuleing market... The two sets of hydrogen compressors
organized to be packaged by GHT this time, using the American PDC
diaphragm compressor head, can meet the 45MPa filling pressure, and
their daily hydrogenation capacity reaches 1000kg and 500kg. The
products will be used in the hydrogen refueling station project of
CMIC Yiho’s potential customers"

H2, NH3 can do long-distance, short-distance. Can do massive storage,
small storage, long-term storage, any kind of storage without much
added bizarre tech.

If we play this right motorheads even will have their beloved
combustion engines with all the familiar dynamics attached to them.
Heating, cooling will be solved, efficiently.

Try sending electricity from UAE to Japan. That would be a pretty
stupid experiment, right?

Article prefaced comment with 'still' assuming both previous projects
listed were not related to oil and gas? The clean ammonia project was
blue ammonia, meaning it was generated from natgas + CCUS.

Al Monitor: "[R]ecently, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company sent the
experimental energy form clean ammonia to Japan. In May, the Emirati
renewable energy company Masdar unveiled a plant that turns garbage
into energy. Still, gas and oil remain integral to the Emirati economy"

Al Monitor: "Clean ammonia from Abu Dhabi has made its way to
Japan.. [said] The Japanese oil company Inpex... The ammonia was made
via natural gas from ADNOC’s Fertiglobe joint venture with the Dutch
chemical company OCI...

Ammonia is a compound of hydrogen and nitrogen that can be used as
fuel. Blue ammonia refers to ammonia that is derived from hydrogen in
natural gas. Green ammonia is produced using green hydrogen, which is
made from renewable energy. So-called 'clean ammonia' comprises both
blue and green.. ammonia from Abu Dhabi is “clean” because the carbon
dioxide emitted from the ammonia production process was 'sequestered
and injected into Abu Dhabi onshore oil fields,' meaning it was not
released into the atmosphere"

H2 Central: "EGP and Acciaierie di Sicilia are launching a new project
for the production of green hydrogen: a sustainable solution to reduce
the steel industry’s high greenhouse gas emissions...The goal is to
use green hydrogen to replace 30% of the natural gas currently used in
the furnaces to heat the rolling mills, thereby meeting a large part
of the company’s energy needs that cannot be satisfied using
electricity"

Ghee is expensive compared to regular oils, butter; must be the extra
processing.

Even more purified fat than butter says lit.

"Extracting the pure oil from cheese"? That's like ghee isn't it?

Hubble tension.. When you assign a new term to ignorance all of a
sudden it sounds scientific. Why dont you say *we dont know what the
fuck is going on here*

"Multiple methods have been used to determine the Hubble
constant. 'Late universe' measurements using calibrated distance
ladder techniques have converged on a value of approximately 73
km/s/Mpc. Since 2000, 'early universe' techniques based on
measurements of the cosmic microwave background have become available,
and these agree on a value near 67.7 km/s/Mpc. (This is accounting for
the change in the expansion rate since the early universe, so is
comparable to the first number.) As techniques have improved, the
estimated measurement uncertainties have shrunk, but the range of
measured values has not, to the point that the disagreement is now
highly statistically significant. This discrepancy is called the
Hubble tension"

FDR, Lincoln, Washington.

Is US in recession? Econ defines it as two consecutive quarters of neg
growth. Q1 quarterly growth rate annualized [was](2019/05/stats.html#gdp)
already -1.57%. Guesstimate for this Q, from FRED (the
so-called GDPNow number) is

```python
import util; df = util.get_fred(2021,"GDPNOW"); df.tail(1)
```

```text
Out[1]: 
            GDPNOW
DATE              
2022-04-01 -1.5245
```

Then chances are high there will be a recession declaration when the
GDP number for Q2 comes out.
