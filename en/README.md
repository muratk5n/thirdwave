ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜† ðŸ˜† So *The West Wing*.. Constant drama. Were there aides,
passing papers to each other in the hallway?

WaPo: "[The honorary chairman of the U.S. bid for the 2022 tournament]

But Al Jazeera is a good channel, a good source for info most of the
time. Just saying these are some of the things that go through my mind
when docus like that show up.

I guess FIFA/Qatar tried to make the best of it by trying to organize
a good Cup, and making sure (!) Argentina got the Prize (that penalty
in the last game.. shady).

---

Aahh the 2010s.. Qatar was on the move, on the rise, helping "topple
dictators" Kaddafi, Mubarak, stirring shit up along with US all over
the globe.. Woo hooo! We have arrived baby! Winning the rights to host
the 2022 FIFA World Cup was part of that rise. We know the rest of the
story - the Arab Spring turned sour (along with Qatar's claim for the
top spot), the allegation of bribery of FIFA officials became so
rampant it destroyed the careers of all involved, including then chief
S. Blatter.

Hah. Al Jazeera docu defends their involvement in the Arab Spring as
defending "democracy". That's not exactly true, especially thinking
AJ's money source, Qatar. Why would Qatar, an emirate care about
democracy?  They cared more about spreading their own influence in the
region, and to supplant Saudi Arabia as a power center.

TFI Global: "The American strategy in the Ukraine conflict is aimed
solely at severing ties between Europe and Russia, and the West has
made desperate attempts to do so. However, in the end, their efforts
may be in vain...

Despite the harsh sanctions imposed on Moscow since its full-scale
invasion of Ukraine nearly a year ago, a paper published by.. [DE]
economy ministry claimed that trade data showed a 'considerable
amount' of sanctioned products were being exported from the EU and
Germany to certain third countries and then exported further from
there to Russia""
