H2 Fuel News: "EU plunges into green hydrogen and renewables plans as
it sidesteps Russian gas Commission says the RePowerEU plan will
achieve independence from Russian energy before 2030.  The European
Commission claims that its plan for using renewables and green
hydrogen will ensure that the EU will achieve independence from
Russian fossil fuels 'well before 2030.''

Coal IGCC tech + CCS overnight capital cost is $3819/KW, almost on par
with coal plant wout CCS. LCOE is high but LCOH is low. Letz have blue
H2 coming out of all those plants.

"To spur CSP industry advancement and achieve an energy cost goal of 5
cents per kWh [currently it is at 9 cents/kWh], the U.S. Department of
Energy’s (DOE’s) Gen3 CSP program funds research to explore the
potential of several heat transfer mediums... Investigating three heat
transfer materials: [the] liquid pathway (exploring use of molten salt
as a heat transfer material, led by NREL), a particle pathway (using
sand-like particles as a heat transfer material, led by Sandia
National Laboratories), and a third pathway exploring the use of gas
as heat transfer material (led by Brayton Energy).

In March of 2021, DOE down-selected among the three pathways to fund
further research into particle-based storage, butm also created an
opportunity for NREL to further develop the liquid pathway over the
next two years"

Funky. What is the LCOE, ONC?

Wiki: "The solar updraft tower.. is a design concept for a
renewable-energy power plant for generating electricity from low
temperature solar heat. Sunshine heats the air beneath a very wide
greenhouse-like roofed collector structure surrounding the central
base of a very tall chimney tower. The resulting convection causes a
hot air updraft in the tower by the chimney effect. This airflow
drives wind turbines, placed in the chimney updraft or around the
chimney base, to produce electricity"

Solar Chimney Power Plant? Seriously.

The era, region was shown with some style, and now movie almost has a
documentary feel to it bcz, well, that's how things were back
then. Now many years later we can refer to it and say 'mujaheddin were
friends, remember Rambo 3?'. A marker in history. Can't ask for
anything more.

"Was Rambo 3 US mil propaganda, showing the 'friends' at the time as good guys?"

American Indians could survive on Pemmican, for a long time, which is
basically dried red meat (from grass-fed animals), mixed with fat and
berries.

I think firing based on fatness should be legit. But then people
should be able to sue soft drink companies, even the government who
advocated low-fat high-sugar diets all these years leading to bizarre
unbalanced eating habits.

Bloomberg: "Yes, You Can Still Be Fired for Being Fat..Weight-based
discrimination costs some Americans their jobs. Bills in New York and
Massachusetts could expand protections to tens of millions of people"

Putin's gonna Putin. Whachu gonna do 'bout it? That has been the

Better that than the loose cannons who invade countries left and right
in order to spread liberalism, and the in-between do-nothings who
somehow think muddling through the swamp left for them by liberal
preachers is manageable.

Kissinger is what Mearsheimer would call a realist. It's a thing.

I hate to say it, and some people really dislike him, but Kissenger
always warned against NATO expansion. William Burns too BTW, the
sitting director of CIA.

---

Had nothing against JS, first thing I heard about him was before
NatSec he was part of the Dems trying to push for more left-leaning
policies? A negative, he was in that Russia Russia Russia crowd pre
2020, now it looks like he was more shitlib then left, and on RU front
he might given some bad advice.
