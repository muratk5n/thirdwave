H2 View: "A new screening tool could save ¬£7bn (8.6bn) and¬† give oil
and gas infrastructure a new lease of life with hydrogen and carbon
capture and storage (CCS). The tool developed by the North Sea
Transition Authority (NSTA) is set to be handed out to operators with
oil and gas fields six years from cessation of production to identify
kit that could be repurposed for hydrogen or CCS. It is hoped the tool
could be instrumental in multibillion-pound savings across hydrogen
and CCS scale up, by cutting back the need to construct new equipment"

Your tax dollars at work.. Gov official 'exploring pathways', toiling

the next jackass tech CEO strut on stage during a "tech conference"
think about what allowed that to happen.

Do green fine. But then dont be confused when your gov is still
talking about refineries, oil price, crude, natgas.

---

Saw it again on the news "a renewable project in [blah] hoping to
'replace Russian gas'". I look for the wattage it says 100 megawatts
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fossil sources can produce **six hundred times** of your yet
non-existing project with a single pipeline. Guy has no clue.

---

I said "know how to sell" but get the policy right first. 

---

If exclusively emphasized green production was the right play, after
all this investment and thought-energy going into them, this would be
their moment to shine. Where are they? All the talk is about Russian,
Qatari gas, Saudi Arabia and now coal (it's back!)  which people were
thinking was being phased out.

Shitlib Dems need to own this fuck up. The West Wing act failed you.
You weren't smart, just like the writers of that show, you were just
dumb as fuck as they were, you only tried made it look good.

---

Coal is making a comeback. Oil/gas is all people talk about.. Somebody
surely effed up big time.

---

The grid is an abomination.  Especially for long-distance power
transmission it makes no sense to use it. 

---

Policy can encourage clean fuel transmisson and discourage fossil at
all stages in the energy chain. The further fossil moves the more
taxes it can get levied on.

Produce natgas fine, ship as LNG but that can cost little more. LNG
arrives at port, if it isn't converted to H2 for the rest of the
transmission, costs more still. Natgas reaches individual homes for
heating, same.. Those taxes over time can gradually be raised, since
changes will build up, biz will see where things are going, and line
up their investments accordingly (for H2 conversion, CCUS).

---

Obviously "alternative media" followed MSM too. Notice how the said
"alternative" toe the line veeeery carefully, won't veer away from
established talking points. Basically what you get is MSM narrative
with a few spaz out sessions sprinkled in to make it look "relatable",
"down to earth". Thought leaders could emerge there and some have
promise but mostly it is dumb repeats and culture war.

---

MSM simply followed the "electrification" mantra without thinking much
about it, that's what they do, repeat what was handed down from Dem
gamma cucks.

During jury duty people (even if non-gov, dont know policy) spend a
huge amount of time on one case, they turn into a mini expert on that
subject for a brief amount of time. In this case collective opinion
(of semi-experts) will work. We saw on Johnny Depp's case, they heard
the evidence, made a good call.

"If regular people are clueless, have no expertise on larger issues,
why should they be given jury duty?"

---

Court cases, hearings are great. Let's have more of them. So much
stuff comes out, it's informative.

Davis: "Russia May Win The War In Ukraine.. It is time to strip off
the rose-colored glasses much of the West has worn when looking at
Russia‚Äôs war of aggression against Ukraine and acknowledge the cold,
hard truth: the Russians are on course to win. The longer we traffic
in the fiction that Ukraine still has a chance, the more Ukrainian
civilians will be killed, the more cities will be destroyed, and the
higher the probability that Russia seizes yet more territory before a
negotiated settlement can end the fighting ‚Äì potentially including
Kyiv. You‚Äôd never know that, however, listening to high-ranking
current and former officials in the West"

"@DanDePetris

If you‚Äôre arguing for Ukraine to fight, fight, fight until every inch
of Ukrainian territory is liberated from the Russians, then have the
decency to mention the extremely high cost in (Ukrainian) lives that
would be required to get there‚Äîassuming we even get there (unlikely)"
