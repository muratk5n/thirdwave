It is true - Obama created this cunt. It might be his biggest
mistake. He gave the e-jagoff space contracts, which were used to
create a geek image, and that helped propel other ventures, shoddy
"gizmo-biz" concoctions at best.

---

That's why the e-jagoff keeps [badmouthing](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/elon-musk-has-strong-views-on-hydrogen-and-not-everyone-agrees.html)
the 'other option' bcz he remembers at one point in his sad
company's history, resources were taken from that other option, and
given to him. That, combined with low rates made that company
what it is today, not any solid foresight on tech or brains.

Bama admin did make that wrong emphasis on battery electric. They went
for the Obamacare of green tech, I guess that should not be
surprising.

I already [some good material](2022/06/population-demographics-growth.html)
on the topic, but I did some extra data analysis (same post,
bottom part). No blatant correlation between working age population
(ratio) and gdp per capita. In fact I've never seen a less uncorrelated
graph in my life, on an issue whose claims are so big..

They constantly use Japan as an example in this space, 'population
collapse', yet Japan is doing fine.

I repeat the argument I used last time - how many people does it take
to invent a f-ing Walkman?

"Working age population decreasing will mean the collapse of economies"

"Ew but demographics". That old chestnut.. is getting old 🤨. This is
the go-to analysis for people who want to throw around some
sophisticated-ish sound bytes wout much work.

Sample output below. Not bad..

I might switch to this lib.

```python
import trafilatura
downloaded = trafilatura.fetch_url('https://www.cnbc.com')
print (trafilatura.extract(downloaded))[2300:2500]
```

```python
