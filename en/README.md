H2 View: "$127.9m boost for zero emissions vehicles in
Australia.. Unveiled.. by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency
(ARENA) on the behalf of the Australian Government, the Future Fuels
Programme will see funding dedicated to the roll-out of hydrogen fuel
cell vehicles and the supporting infrastructure"

Freaking massive

H2 View: "The Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) has announced
that it is submitting a green hydrogen infrastructure application
to construct an electrolyzer with a capacity between 10GW and 20GW"

"As alternative to molten salts-based systems [used by most CSPs],
other energy storage systems are being proposed in the last years
... Limestone, which is the second most abundant material on Earth
after water, can be employed for this purpose. In the so-called
Calcium Looping (CaL) process, direct solar radiation is used to carry
out the endothermic calcination reaction releasing CO2 and CaO as
products that are stored separately. Storage conditions and time
depends on the energy demand. When energy is needed, the stored
products are brought together to carry out the exothermic carbonation
reaction which releases the stored energy"

Li-on batteries are limited by world lithium reserves. At its max this
tech can only handle 5% of global storage need. They are doomed to
remain marginal, and eventually irrelevant.

Switch to a green econ cannot be accomplished on the backs on bunch of
people "putting up solar panels on their rooftops". That's good, but
not everyone lives in a setting they can do that easily. Green energy
needs to be a product, which can be transmitted easily, and stored as
needed in huge amounts.

With all that solar potential there is no reason China should not one
day become energy independent.

That sucks for Russia

Wow. Scholz has just announced that NordStream 2 will not be certified"

"If it aint Boeing I aint going". That used to be a saying? Maybe the
saying changed a little bit recently, no?

"Germany will offer its population a new protein-based Covid-19
vaccine comparable to conventional flu jabs this week, in the hope of
swaying a sizeable minority that remains sceptical of the novel mRNA
technology used in the most commonly used vaccines"

Mango is potent.. Planning to add it to the veg patty mix. Replaced
marmite with avacado (high on the B vitamins, w fats), added spinach
for lutein (for eyesight longevity). Testing.

Most likely you're reading my tweets because I'm an engineer, and I
talk a lot about it. But, first and foremost, I'm Ukrainian. And I
just spent an hour of my life listening to the president of another
country ranting about how my country shouldn't exist"

Oz had really locked it all down hadn't it.. This is good

The Guardian: "Emotional scenes at Sydney airport as families, friends
and lovers reunite after 704 days of Covid restrictions"

It matters bcz countries will attempt to pull discussion to bodies
they are part of, and by doing that they might be pushing some
countries out of the discussion. China might steer things to UNSC bcz
it is a permanent member there, away from G7, while Germany might do
the reverse. US, being in both, can pick and choose, select either
format just to freeze out countries that are not in one or the
other. That does not lead to a democratic environment.

UNSC permanent members are basically the victors of WWII; from
long-time ago. A more inclusive org with major teeth is needed. The
new org should also decide on a majority vote basis. If you piss
off more than half the countries, it should mean something.

"Why does membership in UNSC and G7 matter in world matters?'
