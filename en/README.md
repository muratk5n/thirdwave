H2 Central: "Thyssengas is planning an 800-kilometer hydrogen launch
grid in Germany... The transmission system operator Thyssengas
currently operates a 4,400-kilometre-long transmission network, most
of which still transports natural gas. But that is about to change. In
the future, these pipelines will gradually be converted to hydrogen..

With the establishment of a ‚ÄúThyssengas H2 start network‚Äù based on the
existing natural gas network, Thyssengas wants to underline its own
claim to be a pioneer and designer of the energy transition... [Its
CEO] sees the establishment of an H2 network based on existing natural
gas pipelines as a necessary lever and an important signal to
producers, importers and consumers in the Thyssengas grid area...

Thyssengas‚Äô hydrogen grid planning is based on around 45 declarations
of intent (MoUs) that Thyssengas has concluded with potential hydrogen
producers and customers as part of a market survey conducted by FNB
Gas e.V., an association of supra-regional gas transport companies.

Over the 800 kilometres of pipeline identified, these future customers
are to be reliably supplied with hydrogen from 2030 at the
latest. These are lines that are to be successively rededicated for
hydrogen transport or rebuilt in parts"

Gress, head of Continental‚Äôs corporate communications and public

TDB: "The Marvel Cinematic Universe‚Äôs Phase 4 Has Been a Total Train
Wreck.. [T]hough CinemaScore grades are reliably unreliable, the fact
that three of the four most poorly rated MCU films have premiered in
the past 12 months isn‚Äôt a coincidence. The quality has noticeably
dipped, and when coupled with a general sense of aimlessness, it‚Äôs
time to begin wondering if there‚Äôs a coherent plan guiding the MCU
into its future‚Äîand if all of its fans will stick around long enough
to see it finally materialize

MCU is building up to this? Read both 80s and 2015. The 80s one was
weird (but made money they say). 2015 could be their target. Dr Doom
kills Thanos! üòÇ Spoiled that muthaf..ka didn't I? Aw shit

OK. I read the comic what about it?

MCU Secret Wars?

It makes sense the right does not like teachers; they are the
personification of a dumb shitlib who doesn't know anything but simply
relays knowledge from some kind of 'authority' to the student but
thinks are always right because those authorities happen to be secular
-which of course is no guarantee for anything-.

---

I recommend, teachers, record your own lectures, and flip the
classroom. Next stage, flip the classroom around *someone else's
lecture*, students get quality that way if the teacher is a 'dud'.

---

The lack of focus on the latter part causes focus on the
former..

Alternative ed is not being discussed, so within the confines of
current system teacher quality would be the focus - that is the only
parameter that can be tuned.

On that, [some countries](2021/03/unrivaled-beckley.html#ed) do well,
but most others dont.. I don't think you can do Finland style ed
without being Finland. We need a scalable new approach.

The Mandarin: "Remember when former [Oz] Morrison government minister
Stuart Robert lashed out at 'dud' teachers? In March, the then-acting
education minister said the 'bottom 10%' of teachers 'can‚Äôt read and
write' and blamed them for declining academic results.. We are fixated
on 'teacher quality'.. My analysis found the focus on 'quality' was
far more on teachers than, say, teaching approaches, schools,
schooling, education systems or anything else"

Osmium! Diamonds look ok too.

The outer alliance did a good job isolating Europe from its energy
supply. Look anywhere in the map where Europe can get energy, "the
Anglos" created major trouble. Oil-rich Libya? Turned into a
'shitshow' thanks to US. Iran with massive oil/gas reserves is
constantly kept outside the system... Iraq is a clusterfuck, but by
now an old story. Russian relationship? Turned sour thanks to US
meddling in Ukraine. I bet these muckers would mess with Norway if
they could because they are suppling energy to Europe.

Covid: My vote is still is accidential lab leak of engineered virus
(US's fault for allowing research to begin with and using an
unreliable lab) or, less likely but still possible, intentional leak
triggered by shadowy US figures. I put intentional China triggered
leak below those two - the aftermath makes it less likely, China had
no good vaccines, and continued lockdowns, workplace interruptions
caused major headaches for them.

"@DanielLDavis1

The US gives Ukraine sophisticated HIMARs rocket launchers that hurt
Russia. Moscow responds by getting 100s of sophisticated attack drones
from Iran that will likely hurt Ukraine. Neither is a 'game changer'
for either side"
