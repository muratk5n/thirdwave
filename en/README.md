Financial Review: "Global energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates
the seaborne trade of hydrogen will grow to 150 million tonnes by
2050.. Europe alone is expected to import 10 million tonnes of
hydrogen by 2030. To meet that demand, ports are being specially
designed to feed into dedicated hydrogen infrastructure across the
Netherlands and into Germany"

99 Percent.. The tech sounds like an uber H2 extractor; from methane,
*and* from ammonia? Both a steam reformer and a cracker.

Science.org: "[Discovered an] alternative to directly transporting
hydrogen produced at large scales through steam reforming for
applications such as vehicular fueling is smaller scale, on-site
production from methane or carriers such as ammonia. The hydrogen
produced must be separated from co-produced carbon dioxide or
nitrogen.

Proton ceramic electrochemical reactors can extract pure hydrogen from
gas mixtures by electrolytically pumping protons across the membrane
at 800Â°C, but as the extraction proceeds, temperature gradients and
entropic effects lead to efficiency drops. ClarkÂ et al. developed a
nickel-based glass-ceramic composite interconnect that allowed for the
design of a more complex reactor pathway (see the Perspective by Shih
and Haile). Counterflowing streams balanced heat flows and maintained
stable operating conditions that enabled 99% efficiency of hydrogen
recovery"

It cld be helpful for the new actor.. No need to ask director what

Reshooting a movie isn't impossible; they do it all the time. Back to

That's crazy. That will help turn crypto even more of a speculative
asset. Nearly all of coins are incorrectly designed as currency, dont
want more people rushing into these things, creating fragility in the
system.

Politico: "FTX, a global crypto exchange led by 30 year-old
billionaire and political mega-donor Sam Bankman-Fried, has engaged in
a full-court press convincing the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
to sign off on its plan to let investors use borrowed money to trade
crypto around the clock"

She surely believes in that political choice, what I'm saying is the
system will pull people from extremes fitting a certain mold. The
pro-choice Catholic ends up in Dem leadership, the only Episcopalian
who is anti-abortion ends up as Fox News anchor. These actors will
heatedly argue over stuff that could've easily been handled (in fact
was) years ago. Centrist Democrats did that. They committed the
Original Sin. Know Thy Side.

---

Abortion is the other hot-button issue Dems helped become this
entangled mess.. Now it's incredible hard to be in Dem leadership and
be anti-abortion. NP is Catholic, but can't be against abortion and
still hold that seat. Not anymore.

That choice was indirectly forced on them by centrist Democrats bcz of
their need for [triangulation](2021/10/all-too-human.html#triangulation).
By trying to be too much like Reps on major issues, they pushed them
further right on social issues, creating deadlock. Dems are the sole
reason for the culture war. Need less bipartisanship, less unity,
more division on major stuff. After every school shooting remember,
it's Bill Clinton's fault.

Comments show that Kissinger, when he was liked or hated, was always
acting as a realist. Surely he was part of a lot of unfavorable
decisions; but he also negotiated an end to the Vietnam War.

"@DanielLDavis1

It is shocking how easily some pundits suggest the US go to war
against China over Taiwan, as @gen_jackkeane does... Losing 1000s of
US troops - and maybe losing US cities to nuclear strikes - doesn't
concern them"
