Watch Mariupol, a city in the South, under attack. It is slowly turning
into a parking lot. The soundbytes coming out of there are not 'the
resistance' but 'humanitarian corridors'. People are trying to get the
f--k out.

---

Why is it assumed there will be 'urban fighting' in Kyiv, Ukranian
cities? Attackers can easily shell, bomb Kyiv into a big pile of
rubble wout taking a step into the city.

Failure of monarchs (first wave concept) being in disagreement with
the modern states (second wave concept) is actually normal. Feudal,
1st wave ruling is about land expansion, posh elites who do whatever
in their palaces (thanks beating on peasants, taking their
money). Second wave structures are different, waves cannot mix like
oil and water. The incompatbility could cause major suffering, as in
the alleged fueling of WWI.

---

WWI being caused by a family feud.. Sometimes real answers are avoided
bcz mainstream (history/politics) wants to hide something. While
studying finance I'd read journos; columnists would regularly throw up
their hands and go "well, it's a mystery, year after year, stimulus
after stimulus, there is still no inflation". The obvious was avoided
-- the money was going to corporations, not to people.

Same with WWI, the bigger reason is "unknown". The assasination of
Franz Ferdinand is the obvious 'trigger', but the plethora of equally
viable (and contradicting) theories fail to reach a conclusion. People
throw up their hands and say "still a big mystery to us". ðŸ¤¨ Is the
consensus made to avoid something?

Yes you could say Ukraine 'ate the quince'

---

Q is somewhat tougher to chew on maybe that's why is used in the idiom.

---

This cld be where the tigger idiom *ayvayÄ± yedi* comes from, 'he ate
the quince'; a way of saying 'you stepped in it' when a person messes
up, stuff goes wrong, and is now in trouble.

---

Haha

Thought ZC was done until the Olympics. Now that is over, any reason
