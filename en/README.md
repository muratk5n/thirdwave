Asking a socmed company to decide themselves to not make something go
viral.. that's like asking McDonalds to sell less burgers.. Tough
ask. Can they determine when something has high DMSI but "can be
dangerous"? The answer is no, because the AI tasked with that job
doesn't work (she said this many times, it's true, even a lot of weak
AI is extremely shoddy). Good testimony though.. there was lots of
useful info in it.

"During the hearing, [Facebook whistleblower] Haugen mentioned that
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg decided to not remove downstream MSI, or
Meaningful Social Interactions, because, rumor has it, peoples'
bonuses were tied to it. Haugen was formerly a product manager on
Facebook's civic integrity team, which focused on election
issues. Facebook got rid of her team shortly before the Jan. 6 riots,
and she quit her job in April.

The downstream MSI is a problematic tool because it predicts when
something might go viral ‚Äî get a lot of views, shares, and comments ‚Äî
and then it pushes that content out to more users"

Most companies cannot use, approach the DARPA model.. preferring a
actor-geek CEO instead, who will acquire, acqu-hire, or madly toss
together actually known tech in a bowl hoping something will come out
of it while trying to look "brave" in the process.
