H2 Central: "[S]ignificant reductions in emissions can be achieved by
using blue hydrogen, which is made from natural gas but incorporates
CO2 capture in its production...

The Sustainable Hydrogen & Recovery of Carbon (SHARC) project [of
Neste] involves water electrolysis technology for the production of
green hydrogen as well as carbon capture from existing hydrogen
production, and the permanent storage of captured CO2. Altogether the
project is set to achieve a reduction of more than 4 million tons of
CO2 emissions at the site in the first 10 years of operation..

To reduce these emissions many countries including the US, Canada, UK,
the Netherlands and Australia are currently investing heavily in blue
hydrogen technology"

H2 Central: "Hydra Energy completes hydrogen conversion of [an]
armoured vehicle..

"[H]ow many heavy-duty truck fleet owners, let alone owners of
purpose-built armoured vehicles, can state they are reducing CO2
emissions by 40% per truck without reducing truck performance and
without any financial burden on the fleet operator?'..

This allows the truck to automatically run on hydrogen up to 40% of
the time and seamlessly switch to diesel when thereâ€™s no more hydrogen
in the tanks. Hydrogen refuelling is also as quick as diesel and the
truck will not experience any loss in fuel efficiency, range, power,
torque, or payload capacity on VEXSLâ€™s routes transporting climate
sensitive, high-risk, high-value goods for its clients"

Now a fraction of energy production is green... What would happen if
wout ramping up that production massive demand is unleashed? Prices
could skyrocket. On the cost side sure, green production is costing
less and less, that is great. Do we have the capacity though and can
we build it in time? That is the question.

---

Talking about price or cost? IMO more green production is needed for
an effective comparison.

People would work just fine even with UBI. There will be no labor shortage.

Crises' happen because the system insists on printing new money for
business credit which can cause bubbles, inflation, wage stagnation,
unemployment, and everythin in between. The transmission mechanism is
too kludgy.

---

It would be ideal if the econ system was ready for a pandemic from
get-go; Lockdown caused savings build-up and supply disruptions,
globally. A money system prepared for that would have used digital
money that "prints" UBI monthly for everyone, by default, business
credit would get doled out of this new money, therefore people always
have money to keep them afloat. There can never be excessive printing
bcz printing at pre-decided level is the norm.

An early demo of what is possible with synthetic fuel generation. Once
you add CCS on top, you get clean fuel.

The Allies bombed those synfuel plants, that's why Germany 'ran out of fuel'.

"[B]efore the War, experts had scoffed at Adolph Hitler's idea that he
could conquer the world largely because Germany had almost no
indigenous supplies of petroleum. Hitler, however, had begun
assembling a large industrial complex to manufacture synthetic
petroleum from Germany's abundant coal supplies"

No, Germany did not lose WWII because "it ran out of fuel". See above

Militarization, Russia related issues have been simmering in Italy
since this April, finally it all blew up, destroying the
government. Yet all you hear on MSM (who is pro-war, pro-military
industrial complex) blamed it all on "argumentive Italians" messing up
another fine government, breaking unity. But there was a serious issue
being discussed, a major disagreement, so the parliamentary make-up
did its magic..

F24: "[June 2022] Turbulence returned to Italian politics this week
thanks to a fallout between the Five Star Movementâ€™s two top
figures. Party leader Giuseppe Conte opposes Prime Minister Mario
Draghiâ€™s support for Ukraine. Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio fervently
backs Draghiâ€™s approach, so he stormed out of Five Star on Tuesday,
taking dozens of MPs with him and splitting in two the biggest member
of Italyâ€™s national unity government"

---

Politico: "[April 2022] Italyâ€™s looming fault line.. Conte â€” who now
heads the 5Star Movement, the biggest party within Italian Prime
Minister Mario Draghiâ€™s government â€” expressed wariness about
longer-term pledges from Italy and others to boost defense spending
after Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine"
