There are products for fruit leather - Saw one by Mixmey in Asia Minor
once. It is advertised as 100% fruit, I'm sure it's true, bcz prod is
incredibly easy to make, doesn't take much processing nor additives.

---

Simply dehydrating blended fruit gives 'fruit leather'. 6-12 hrs at 60
degrees. Done. Portable fruit, it wont go bad for a long time.

Tech‚Äôs high-flying startup scene gets a crushing reality check. Job

Econ structure is a bizarrely convoluted mess. Credit is given to
companies who use it to pay salaries to people. To increase salaries
you have increase credit. But there is no assurance that credit will
go to salaries, it can end up in the stock market. If money does go to
salaries, in excess, this can cause inflation which decreases the
benefit of that increase ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Also too much wage increase can hurt
company bottom line, then biz has to cut costs, fire people - now you
have no salary.

There is nothing special about creating a "bidness". No need to label
these ppl as lyncpins of society. Too much pressure, plus, they r not
able to carry such heavy social function.

Currently new money is given as credit to business, who in turn give
(some) of that money to people as employees. Money reaches regular
people through employment. That creates too much dependency on biz,
also gives them too much power.

The direction of money flow needs to turn upside down; people get the
money first, and *maybe*, businesses get credit down the line. Growth
should not be the primary goal, nor full employment. Right now both of
these issues command an overriding attention because, well, people's
livelihood depend on them.

Defense Priorities: "U.S. military bases and logistics hubs in and
near the Middle East are the primary examples‚Äîthey make foolish wars
too easy to start. Maintaining the ability to use rapid military force
in the region has become an end unto itself, unmoored from any clear
vital strategic interest"

Actually recently US seems to prefer creating chaos to balance this or
that force in foreign lands; being aware of not being able to perform
global cop duties. It is the worst of both worlds, 'meddly US and
chaos'. Jihadi m-f-kers trained and sent to Syria that later blow shit
up in Africa. Help Saddam, so he attacks Iran, then he attacks Kuwait,
shit now he is bad, kill Saddam.

The Spectator World: "‚ÄòAmerica or chaos‚Äô is a false choice.. There is
an age-old dogma in the US foreign policy establishment: when America
pulls back, chaos ensues. Like an anti-inflammatory that keeps
arthritis under control, Washington‚Äôs presence in this or that region
keeps enemies cowed, partners reassured, and the barbarians at the
gates"

After weeks of trying to hammer out a peace deal, negotiators for
Russia + Ukraine appear further apart than at any other point in
nearly 3 mos of war"

---

Politico: "We‚Äôre not all Ukrainians now.. Insisting that the United
States and its NATO allies should want exactly what Ukraine does is
understandable politics ‚Äî but it‚Äôs also dangerous policy.. Such
insistence not only risks dragging us potentially into a nuclear war,
it also risks giving Ukraine false hope and delaying a settlement. And
our natural sympathy for Ukraine shouldn‚Äôt be confused for fully
aligned interests"
