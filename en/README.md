Marcus: "Machine intelligence is increasingly being linked to claims
about sentience, language processing, and an ability to comprehend and
transform natural language into a range of stimuli. We systematically
analyze the ability of [an "AI" NLP system] DALL·E 2 to capture 8
grammatical phenomena pertaining to compositionality that are widely
discussed in linguistics and pervasive in human language: binding
principles and coreference, passives, word order, coordination,
comparatives, negation, ellipsis, and structural ambiguity. Whereas
young children routinely master these phenomena, learning systematic
mappings between syntax and semantics, DALL·E 2 is unable to reliably
infer meanings that are consistent with the syntax of the prompts"

Consa: "QED should be the quantized version of Maxwell’s laws, but it
is not that at all. QED is a simple addition to quantum mechanics that
attempts to justify two experimental discrepancies in the Dirac
equation: the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the
electron.  The reality is that QED is a bunch of fudge factors,
numerology, ignored infinities, hocus-pocus, manipulated calculations,
illegitimate mathematics, incomprehensible theories, hidden data,
biased experiments, miscalculations, suspicious coincidences, lies,
arbitrary substitutions of infinite values and budgets of 600 million
dollars to continue the game.  Maybe it is time to consider
alternative proposals. Winter is coming"

Macgregor: "[T]he military action [Patreus] advocates would not be a
NATO intervention, but “a multinational force led by the US and not as
a NATO force.”. Petraeus does not explain why U.S. military action is
needed. But it’s not hard to guess. The intervention is designed to
rescue Ukrainian forces from defeat..

Petraeus’s suggestion confirms two critical insights. First, the
perilous state of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Absent the foreign
fighters and Polish soldiers fighting in Ukrainian uniform, Ukraine
has little left to withstand the Russian winter offensives. The series
of Ukrainian counterattacks over the last 60 to 90 days have cost
Ukraine tens of thousands of lives, human capital in uniform that Kiev
cannot replace...

Second, it is the 11th hour. The Russian sledgehammer scheduled to
fall on the Zelensky regime in the November or December timeframe, or
whenever the ground freezes, will crush whatever remains of Ukrainian
forces."

"[Justin Goodman] I think [Fauci] has created a culture at the NIH
where this type of dangerous experimentation is encouraged, and
oversight of it is diminished to the highest degree possible, where
there's basically free reign to do whatever you want, and maybe report
it and maybe not, and hope for the best. But that's been happening
since 2001 for the war on terror, there were billions of dollars
dumped into Fauci's division at the NIH for bioweapons defense and
research and a lot of it has turned into this crazy gain-of-function
experimentation that likely caused this pandemic. I promise you are
going to cause another one if we don't do something about it"
