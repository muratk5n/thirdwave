developing a thriving low carbon hydrogen sector in the UK to meet our
ambition for 5GW of low carbon hydrogen production capacity by 2030"

Wait until large standard flatbeds print entire bleeping *buildings*,
destroying millions of construction jobs.. That will bake your noodle
friend.

BIG NEWS: I’ve just introduced legislation in Congress calling for a
four-day work week. It’s well past time that Americans have more time
to live their lives, and not just work"

"@Michael_J_Black

If you believe that social media can replace peer review, consider my
experience. Every paper I've published has been improved by peer
review. I can't say the same for comments on Twitter. I may not always
agree with reviewers but they spend hours with my paper, not seconds"

Laws in physical sciences are mathematical, the best ones are usually
incredibly compact, intelligeble, in continuous form. In order to
compute them the formulas are 'discretized' (a whole branch of sci
itself), approximation is introduced, checked against data.

In ML, or so-called "AI", things work the other way around; they start
with approximation, computation first, and... stay there. They don't
have a formula for their domain. There is no mathematical model of
thought.. all they have is bunch of 'patterns' captured from raw data
in an unintelligeble format.

If anyone thinks one can reach human level AI from this, I have a
bridge to sell them.

"Is Machine Learning compatible with the Scientific Method?.. [P]art
of what we celebrate as scientific progress is the transition from the
data (observed orbits) to patterns in the data (Kepler’s laws) to
theories explaining the data (Newtonian theory of
gravity). [.. M]erely identifying the hidden correlations in the data
is generally not enough in science. It is the explanation of why these
patterns exist with the aid of a more fundamental and universally
applicable scientific theory ... that we acknowledge and cherish as
scientific progress"

Yet "the helicopter lifting off from US embassy in Saigon" is still
the ultimate picture of a foreign policy failure in people's minds.

"Nixon secured his 'decent interval' between the United States pullout
of Vietnam and the N. Vietnamese takeover"

AFP: "Definitely check out ‘Reminiscence’ .. great Minority
Report-style action sci-fi starring Hugh Jackman"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
