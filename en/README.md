Renew Economy: "'Eureka moment' as Australian researchers make
hydrogen storage breakthrough.. A team from Deakin University‚Äôs
Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM) in Melbourne says it has found
a new mechanochemical way of separating and storing gases, which is
safe, uses a tiny fraction of the energy compared to traditional
methods and creates zero waste.

The hero ingredient in the breakthrough is boron nitride powder, which
is has a knack for absorbing substances, being small, but with a large
amount of surface area. It‚Äôs also classed as a ‚Äúlevel-0 chemical,‚Äù
something that is deemed perfectly safe to have in your house.

The researchers put boron nitride powder into a ball mill ‚Äì a type of
grinder containing small stainless-steel balls in a chamber ‚Äì along
with the gases that need to be separated.

As the chamber rotates at a higher and higher speed, the balls collide
with the powder and the wall of the chamber triggers a mechanochemical
reaction resulting in gas being absorbed into the powder.

One type of gas is absorbed quicker, separating it out from the
others, and allowing it to be easily removed from the mill. The
process can be repeated over several stages to separate the gases one
by one.

All up, the process consumes 76.8 KJ/s to store and separate 1000L of
gases, which means it uses at least 90 per cent less than the current
gas separation process commonly used in the petroluem industry...

Even more significantly, once the gas is absorbed into the powder it
gas can be transported safely and easily. When the gas is needed, the
powder can be simply heated in a vacuum to release the gas unchanged...

[The team shows] there‚Äôs mechanochemical alternative, using ball
milling to store gas in the nanomaterial at room temperature. It
doesn‚Äôt require high pressure or low temperatures, so it would offer a
much cheaper and safer way to develop things like hydrogen powered
vehicles.

The next step for the IFM team is to gather industry support and scale
the process up to a full pilot. A provisional patent application has
been submitted for the process"

H2 Central: "SoCalGas launches green hydrogen storage pilot project in
the US.. For this new pilot project, SoCalGas is collaborating with
GKN Hydrogen, a green hydrogen producer from Bonn, Germany, as well as
with the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)..

The US Department of Energy (DoE) has provided 1.7 million in funding
and SoCalGas has provided additional support including $400,000. The
pilot will bring together two of GKN Hydrogen‚Äôs HY2MEGA H2 storage
subsystems with 500 kilograms of capacity for H2 storage...

The green H2 will be stored in a solid state under low pressure in
HY2MEGA hydrogen storage tank, which is a modular metal hydride
technology solution which has been under development for about ten
years"

If coal gasification can generate natural gas, can that be fed into
methane pyrolysis to generate clean gas? There are other methods for
H2 generation from coal with CCS of course.

Missing ratings on either side are not a problem (most ppl dont watch
everything so they are many). In sparse matrix format missing vals are
not stored, dot product calculation is smart enough to skip them and
treat them as zero. If nothing matched dot product gives a zero which
is cosine of 90. You are at 90 degrees to this person, "orthogonal",
at odds shall we say - no matches.  I don't pick that person's movies
for recommendation. The whole thing is calculated is pretty fast
actually.

---

I use "cosine distance" to find users that are similar to my picks. My
mov ratings are in one vector, someone else's in another, similarity
amounts to a "dot product" essentially.

'Consumption habits are changing.. consumption of goods vs services
flipped due to covid' they say..

See below. There was a flip but then it went back to trend, which was
already in the direction of more goods and less services


```python
import util; df = util.get_fred(2010,['DGDSRX1','PCESC96'])
df['Total'] = df.sum(axis=1)
df['Goods'] = df.DGDSRX1 / df.Total
df['Services'] = df.PCESC96 / df.Total
print (df[['Goods','Services']].tail(3))
ax1 = df.Goods.plot(color='blue', grid=True, label='Goods')
ax2 = df.Services.plot(color='red', grid=True, label='Services',secondary_y=True)
h1, l1 = ax1.get_legend_handles_labels()
h2, l2 = ax2.get_legend_handles_labels()
plt.legend(h1+h2, l1+l2, loc=2)
plt.savefig('goods-services.png')
```
