There's been no treaty after Cold War.. Treaty after Thirty Years'
War, treaty after WWI, treaty after WWII, nothing after the Cold War?
Forget Europe, Japan and Russia are still at war today - legally
speaking. Same for North and South Korea.

Insider: "Mercedes-Benz 'Drive Pilot' surpasses Tesla's autonomous driving system"

---

Mercedes-Benz: "At the time of this publishing, DRIVE PILOT's ODD
[Operational Design Domain] is limited to fully access-controlled
highways (commonly called 'freeways') up to a specific maximum
speed. (A fully access-controlled highway is defined as a divided
highway with at least two lanes of traffic in each direction that has
no intersections – only on-ramps and off-ramps.)  DRIVE PILOT's ODD is
further restricted according to the presence or absence of certain
road features and/or conditions, such as:

• Machine-detectable lane markings

• The absence of tunnels, toll booths and traffic control devices
(stop signs, traffic lights, etc.)

• Applicable legal requirements

The resulting ODD boundaries (including available routes) are defined
within a precise, high-definition map.  These boundaries comprise the
“geo-fence” for the area of operation of DRIVE PILOT; it will not
allow the driver to engage the feature, nor will the feature operate
the vehicle, outside of these boundaries"

New: Memphis spent $10 million installing thousands of 24/7
police-linked surveillance cameras, called SkyCops, on the promise
they'd deter crime. But crime's only gone up. And even the cops who
beat Tyre Nichols to death weren't deterred" via WaPo

2022 police shootings data is out.

The data file location changed, its content too, a little? The increase of
'Other' category for 2021 was [higher](2023/01/allshoot1.png) previously which I'd
interpreted as they were simply not recording the race, fudging the numbers.

But an increase of overall killings for 2022 is clearly visible.

H2 Central: "The H2 retrofit kit proposed by SAFRA, registered under
the brand name H2-PACK®, and supported by ADEME, the French Agency for
Ecological Transition, is a real technical achievement which enables

running on hydrogen"

Leader's job is to make sure things did not escalate to this
situation... I won't sit here and repeat the "evil Putin" mantra just

Why won't Russia follow the rules-based-order? They won't follow your
rules if they are not part of the order. In fact, it looks like the
order was built to freeze them out... Which lead to Ukraine.
