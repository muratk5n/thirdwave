GPM is a useful measure for long-term investors, Buffett likes it, no?
I can see why, the measure shows the fundamentals, what it takes to
generate revenue. Above certain threshold, a clear up-trend can
indicate a rosy future; the indirect stuff can be dealt with as
needed.

The high GPM is typical of a software company with a commanding lead
in the marketspace as GPM shows direct costs for creating a product.
Software companies don't typically spend too much to produce,
especially once the core product / platform is mature, likely the case
for SF by now. But if there are a lot of extra, indirect spending,
fluff investments it can hurt OPM, PM.

Guidance for op profit margin was for ~10% and the stock soared?
Buyers must have seen some hope in Salesforce (great stock ticker name
BTW, "CRM")

Yahoo Finance: "Salesforce Inc. surged by the most in almost three
years after raising its forecast for profit margins.. At least five
activist investors, including Elliott and Starboard Value, are pushing
the company to cut costs following a half-decade of aggressive hiring
and large acquisitions.

H2 Central: "There’s Hydrogen In Them There Hills: The Trailblazers
Mining for ‘Gold Hydrogen’..  The cost of extracting hydrogen from the
ground is potentially very cheap compared with existing methods. One
deposit in Mali, which is at a relatively shallow depth and produces
nearly pure hydrogen, could be tapped for 50 U.S. cents per kg"

H2 Central: "China Record-Breaking Green Hydrogen Project is Just The
Beginning.. The largest currently under construction is Ordos, a 390
MW system being built by China’s state-owned oil refining
giant.. Sinopec describes Ordos as a demonstration project and has
said it plans to make 60% of its hydrogen green by 2025, which would
equate to 2.1 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year"

Russian is in the Indo-European family

It's crazy, the homeland includes all the regions being fought over
right now, an area that is the origin of a good chunk of the Eastern
and Western Eurasian culture.

---

Apparently the geo origin of Indo-European languages was an open
question - recently answered, confirming the earlier share with
Kristiansen.
