NYT: "[2016] The Indian government has begun a campaign for the return
of a historic 105.6-carat diamond that was either a gift to Queen
Victoria from the maharajah of Punjab in 1849 or stolen by the
British, depending on some widely divergent perspectives..

For many Indians, the Koh-i-Noor â€” or Mountain of Light â€” is a symbol
of colonial subjugation and three centuries of exploitation that began
with the East India Company in the early 17th century, culminated in
the absorption of India as a colony after a major uprising in 1857 and
ended with the independence, and partition, of India in 1947"

Plus low leader approv would increase MP chances of loss, they have
every reason to vote the leader out.

People also vote for parliament members, within the same party as the
head, and those members have the ability to change the leader.. If
people accept the former they also should accept the latter.

"People vote with a particular party head in mind, changing that
midway is against democracy"
