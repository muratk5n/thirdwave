US gets the right people, and is culturally IMO adamant about
it.. Look at how Obama, the "black President" deported over two
million immigrants. I know two non-American national swimmers,
brothers, *both* of them won the Green card "lottery".

---

UK was pretty quick in granting British passports to Hong Kong
citizens. IMO they want that high-skilled workforce emigrating to UK.
They care more abt that than human rights.

---

US experienced backlash, bcz it had not built mechanisms to
redistribute. UK does have the mechanisms, just could not generate
enough capability, money to do so.

Both Canada and UK took in a lot of immigration but their GDP Per
Capita was flat. 2% ppl increase with 2% GDP increase means no change.
GDP Per Capita captures capability, power, so it is a key measure. It
is likely UK/Canada did not get skilled immigration. In UK's case
maybe this issue backfired, led to Brexit?  There are bunch of new
people around you, but you are not getting disproportionately richer
bcz of it ðŸ¤¨

See I bet the NY voters knew that abt him.. and the stop-and-frisk
thing.. then they made a call. Leader judgement of ppl is not
bad. Policy judgement, not so much.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
