H2 View: "A BMW Group-led consortium has launched a research project
to develop 18-tonne and 40-tonne hydrogen combustion engine trucks in
Germany, backed by €11.3m ($10.7m) of state funding"

90 mil tonnes of H2 translates into 90 * 1e6 * 1000 * 33.6 / (365 * 24 * 1e6),
which is 354 Gigawatts. A sizable chunk of energy.

Reuters: "More than 20 countries, led by Japan, have agreed to boost
output of low-emission hydrogen to at least 90 million tonnes a year
by 2030 from 1 million tonnes now, the Japanese industry ministry said
on Monday"

H2 Fuel News: "Cummins has.. unveiled a medium-duty concept truck
using an H2-fueled internal combustion engine (ICE), which drew
substantial attention in Germany at the IAA Transportation
exhibition. Similarly, Westport Fuel Systems also unveiled its own
HPDI hydrogen ICE engine for heavy duty vehicles earlier this month...

There are a number of benefits that hydrogen combustion engines have
to offer over fuel cells. To start, the technology used by ICE is
already familiar to engineers and mechanics worldwide who provide
maintenance and repairs to trucks and other medium- and heavy-duty
forms of vehicle, equipment and machinery. The technology could be
incorporated into a spectrum of types of vehicles and machinery, not
just trucks...

Cummins demonstrated the ease of H2 ICE deployment by exchanging
a Mercedes-Benz Atego 4×2 truck’s diesel engine for a 6.7-liter H2 ICE
engine. Performance, cargo capacity and payload were all fully
preserved.

Westport has gone so far as to say that its own H2 ICE engine offers a
notable increase in performance when compared to its diesel
equivalent, including 20 percent more power and 18 percent improved
torque.

By using diesel engine architecture and engine manufacturing
infrastructure already in place, Westport has said that its engine
offers the lowest-cost opportunity for achieving CO2 reduction target
compliance. This could also help to minimize a company’s transition
cost while decarbonizing.

'We like to think of it as a game changer without the change,' said
Westport Fuel Systems CEO David Johnson when referring to hydrogen
combustion engines"
