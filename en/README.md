blue H2.

in future pipelines such as Nord Stream would reach 70 percent,
according to Gazprom"

Not that any of that matters now; JB net popularity sank further, -%16

---

Kamala attacked JB now she is VP. Actually attacking can be more
useful, because if picked as VP candidate that can sell better, the
message would be 'see even my biggest detractor is in my corner now'.

---

During Dem debates Gabbard was likely making a VP play (attacked
Kamala, the other likely non-white female candidate
-competition-). Now looks like some at Fox making another VP play for
her? As Trump VP if he runs again?

---

Turkists gaslight. Asia Minor relation in the seas could simply be
explained by looking at the other nations in the area, but no...  We
have to come up with some bed time story about a "migrant" who is
"new" and "different" to the area because such narrative -at one
point- was useful (it isn't even useful anymore, on top of being a
blatant lie).

---

Romans were always a land-centric force, they saw the sea as a way to
transport land troops for subsequent land invasion. When they used the
sea they tried to invent mechanisms to merely complement their land
strength, sometimes in bizarre ways. One invention was a huge landing
platform bolted in the middle of the ship, plan was to pull it down
during ship-to-ship conflict on top of the other ship so regular
legionaires can rush over there and do legionaire shit.. But the
mechanism wasn't designed well it screwed up the balance of the ships,
they routinely sank.

---

There was one Greek ship in the 1900s Georgios Averof that caused huge
damage on the entire Otto navy, allowing Greeks to take more Aegean
islands. That wasn't because Greeks "like the sea more", that ship
used British guns and French boilers. Ship was made in Italy but Italy
too had fallen behind in its sea control comparatively speaking. So
much so that when Hitler made an alliance with fascist Italy the
alliance wasn't seen to have brought more reach for either of them; a
land power allied with another land power.

---

Anatolia isn't averse to the seas, no more or less than other Medi
countries. Anatolian interest did not vane, but ocean capable vessels
developed in Western Europe surpassed theirs, and they lost whatever
edge they had on naval tech.

"Even though TR is a peninsula the lack of emphasis placed on navy
proves people of Turks came from the steppes, a land based culture"

This guy is sucking his own cock. He thinks he is the shit.. Are you
the Magister Equitum over there bitch?

NBC: "[Judge] Alito [said] that the Justices who previously backed
'Roe' were wrong"

---

Roe overturn open up possibilities for internal Dem shuffling; the old
guard lost face, the issue senior shitlibs bang on the drum constantly
for has been lost - now the young cadres can hit them on the head with
this to take their place.

---

There was no other way that stuff could have gone down... US is
getting out, they are coming in. End of story. Tali had to come in
strong (possibly remembering the ass-kicking they received decades
earlier), go blitzkrieg to create a psyc scare factor; AFG army would
have to think "OMG US is leaving" along with "OMG Tali is coming
in". That was their goal and they succeeded. Of course it looked bad
for US, it sucked. But on the whole these people are poor, live out of
shoddy shacks with a few sheep

---

Why? Because they caused embarrassment during US pullout? Get over it. 

"Biden aides seek to unlock Afghan reserves without enriching Taliban"

They are right to doubt
