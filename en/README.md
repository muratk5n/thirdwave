care personally for it, but this is a good chunk of ideology that
needs representation, right?.

"[6/2021] Lib Dems seize Chesham and Amersham seat off Tories"

"[5/2021] Conservatives hail historic Labour defeat in Hartlepool"

80+ year olds, battling cancer and heart disease. Now they're all

causes. (Likely COVID-19 and unvaccinated.) Enough preventable
deaths. Please"
