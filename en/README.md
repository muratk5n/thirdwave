H2 View: "In a bid to secure US Department of Energy (DOE) funding for
the development of a hydrogen hub, the West Virginia Hydrogen Hub
Coalition has officially submitted its proposal. The state becomes one
of the first to officially submit a proposal with the Mountain State’s
abundance of renewable energy set to be coupled for mass hydrogen
production and the integration of several end applications to boost
the hydrogen economy..

West Virginia already has a rich background in coal, gas and oil and
thus could have an extensive list of potential hydrogen customers that
can be utilised to surge demand for the clean energy carrier. Another
important factor is the availability of skill energy workforce and
with West Virginia’s already established energy sector, the jobs could
transition to hydrogen and support the emerging technologies and
wprojects.

US Senator Joe Manchin, Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, said, 'With our abundant energy sources and
strong partnerships, our state is uniquely situated to compete to
develop a hydrogen hub..'"

Salt caverns, and lined rock caverns.. There is a third method, using
pipeline pieces, underground..  We know a pipeline network itself is
also a storage mechanism, well, why not use pieces of pipeline
hardware and stack them on top of eachother underground, creating an
uber storage system?

Here is another method

CNBC: "[2020] Caverns can be created in salt domes by drilling into
the salt dome and injecting the rock with water, which dissolves the
salt. The resulting brine is extracted, leaving a large cavity. The
next step is storing hydrogen in the cavern...

'[One] formation has the potential to create up to 100 caverns, each
one capable of holding 150,000 MWh of energy,' says Browning [CEO of
Mitsubishi Power US, now at Fortesque]. 'It would take 40,000 shipping
containers of batteries to store that much energy in each cavern.'"

26.7 million dollars for 100 m3 storage. At 250 bars H2 has energy
density is 700 kwh/m3, this is 70 MWh of storage. It's pretty cheap.
The equivalent lion battery install would cost $44 million. Digging a
hole and putting some protective material on the walls is much
easier.

Daily Scandanavian: "Hydrogen Storage Facility in Sweden Has Reached
Halfway Point in Construction..  Construction of the 100-cubic-meter..
rock cavern storage facility 30 meters below ground is done by
Vattenfall AB in collaboration with Swedish steel company SSAB AB..,
iron ore miner Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB..  The three owners
invested around USD 21.4m.. in three equal parts, with the Swedish
Energy Agency contributing just over SEK 52 million towards the
hydrogen storage construction.

The cavern is being built via the so-called lined rock cavern (LRC)
approach, which involves covering the walls of the cavern with a
selected matter. The technology for storing gas in a lined rock cavern
(LRC) is well proven and has been used in southern Sweden for about 20
years for storing natural gas. However, the technology is now taking
another step forward as it’s being developed for the first time with
hydrogen gas on a large pilot scale... The finished plant will contain
hydrogen gas pressurized up to 250 bar"

"@DrLeanaWen [Public health professor George Washington Public Health]

For those who don’t agree that the vaccinated can return to
pre-pandemic normal, I ask: What should we all do? Perpetual masking?
Forever not dining out, avoiding large weddings & indoor gatherings,
etc? Virtually everything has risk, and zero covid is not a viable
strategy"

Ran the code below at different times, PM 2.5 is mostly above 80.
Many other cities are in bad shape too, thanks to fossil. Data is from
Openweathermap who take their data directly from [SILAM](http://silam.fmi.fi/aqforecast.html).
My access code is [here](tweets/2022/util.py).

```python
import util, datetime
aqi, res = util.pollution(28,77)
print (datetime.datetime.now(), res['pm2_5'])

WION had a segment on New Delhi air quality. One report found over 96
mg/m3 PM 2.5 concentration? Segment had doubts on the sponsor of the
report, IOAir, which sells air purifier products. Good to know... I
double-checked though and it is true, PM 2.5 is high.
