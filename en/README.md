WION: "Russia vetoes UN bid to condemn annexations of Ukrainian
territory, India and China abstain"

---

The four regions of Ukraine, I guess now of Russia, below. RU has more
war to execute on two - Donetsk, and Zaporizhia. Not surprising heavy
fighting has been going on in Bakhmut.

Methane gas leaks, errant viruses (still), wars that cannot be brought
to an end - not looking too good for the humankind..

"@Math_Professor

[C]an also be used as an algorithm to convert any repeating decimal to
a fraction.

E.g. if x=.121212…,

100x=12.121212…

And x=12/99=4/33"

"@RalphCrutzen

Let x = 0.9999...

10x = 9.9999...

10x - x = 9.9999... - 0.9999...

9x = 9

x = 1"

H2 View: "The State of West Virginia, US has revealed plans to develop
a regional clean hydrogen hub in collaboration with gas producer EQT
Corporation, Battelle, GTI Energy, and Allegheny Science & Technology
(AST)...

According to the collaboration, existing infrastructure for natural
gas production and storage, existing pipelines and transportations,
and proximity to end-user markets in the Midwest and Northeast, will
come be used as significant resources for ARCH2.

The announcement comes less than a week after the US Department of
Energy (DOE) opened applications for its $7bn regional hydrogen hub
funding programme which is set to fund six to 10 hubs across the US"

Bonds are the safest inv mech there is, the coupon payment at certain
date is guaranteed but if one were to sell them early one is at the
mercy of the recent price which apparently fell.

CNBC: "[BOE intervened in the bond market bcz of] panic among pension
funds, with some of the bonds held within them losing around half
their value in a matter of days"

These F-16 upgrades are a thang aren't they? 

---

US readies F-16 package to Pakistan and says "it is all
counter-terrorism related". Indian FM was pissed says "you are not
fooling anybody by saying these things".

At the mid level K could be thousands, D could be millions, for small
M and N, you end up with a small M by N matrix.

I bet some started to realize what this could be used for ;) Handle
with care.

---

Can have probabilities on those transitions (see pic), and each cld
represent a decision, each "type" of decision could be one level. Then
example M by A in the beginning, leading to A by K, K by D, D by
N... on and on, no matter how long the path is, simple multiplication
will sum over all those paths you end up with likelihood of being at
an N cell (decision) starting with an M starting point. 

---

What's more, the paths can be as long as possible, mat mult will
collapse them, will summarize "all paths".

---

[That's true](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Fd5CzwcXoAAJQSv?format=png&name=small).

"Matrix multiplication corresponds to traveling along paths [of graphs]"
