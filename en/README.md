Mastodon]... basically every notable blogger from the year 2005 is
here!.. üòÇ Meanwhile, it's kinda funny how crypto people are entirely
absent in the Fediverse, given their professed love of
decentralization. (Perhaps they were not not so much into
decentralization but rather recentralization of wealth around
themselves!)"

facility is illegal.. [he] was initially referring to Ukraine‚Äôs
Zaporizhzhia plant, which has come under repeated attack amid the

from Tehran. However, asked about threats by Israel and the United
States to target Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites, Grossi said that the principle
stood for all nuclear facilities around the world"
