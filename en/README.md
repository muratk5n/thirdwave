If "they" wanted to get you, "sterilize you through covid
vaccinations", I dont think they'd wait until a worldwide crisis, and
a brand new vaccination campaign. They could do it through food, soft

get. They'd just slip it in there, and noone would ever know.. if it
were that easy.

other side of the world during WWI, bcz of the Brits naval help
quid-pro-quo, had to provide manpower.. Pertinent piece of history for
me bcz the soldiers landed on Galipoli, in my home country! All the
way from Australia!
