NL company - apparently they can do this at scale? Supercritical water
gasification - something to look out for.

SCW Systems: "[W]e also know water as a gas in the form of steam and
as a solid in the form of ice. But there is also a fourth state of
water: the supercritical state. Under extreme conditions (very high
pressure and temperature) water acquires very special properties. This
is the core of this technology.

If we mix water with organic wastes and bring it into the
supercritical state, something special happens. All organic matter in
the water, both recently formed organic matter and fossil-based,
breaks down into gases we can put to good use: methane and hydrogen"

This might actually be the paper that initiated the SP wording
\#ChatGPT \#DeepShit

"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots.. [One] category of risk
involves bad actors taking advantage of the ability of large
[neural-net based language models -LM-]s to produce large quantities
of seemingly coherent texts on specific topics on demand in cases
where those deploying the LM have no investment in the truth of the
generated text. These include prosaic cases, such as services set up
to â€˜automaticallyâ€™ write term papers or interact on social media..

Yet another risk connected to seeming coherence and fluency involves
machine translation (MT) and the way that increased fluency of MT
output changes the perceived adequacy of that output.  This differs
somewhat from the cases above in that there was an initial human
communicative intent, by the author of the source language
text. However, MT systems can (and frequently do) produce output that
is inaccurate yet both fluent and (again, seemingly) coherent in its
own right to a consumer who either doesnâ€™t see the source text or
cannot understand the source text on their own"

Currently less than 2% of labor is sufficient to produce food - this
is the percentage of labor in farming. That means the labor of 98% is
already not necessary for the most essential item - sustenance.

Guy signed up right after 9/11 in that gung-ho atmosphere, deployed to
Afghanistan; But called the Iraqi invasion illegal, and was killed
afterwards?  Actually from a just war viewpoint, AFG was the place
9/11 originated, so attacking it at least initially may not
be.. unjust. I had not heard about the PT Iraqi crit, that's good, the
guy wasn't some blind overzealous nationalist dipshit. He was probably
killed for it, by the deep state, sorry "friendly fire" ðŸ¤”.
