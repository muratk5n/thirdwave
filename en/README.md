H2 Fuel News: "Unilever begins hydrogen fuel trial in its factory
boilers.. Unilever will be testing hydrogen fuel in the boilers of its
Port Sunlight factory located near Liverpool in the United
Kingdom. The decarbonization pioneering demonstration project involves
using low carbon H2. This hydrogen fuel test is a component of a
broader HyNet Industrial Fuel Switching program, which is focused on
the decarbonization of heavy industry in the northwest of
England. [The demo] is believed to be the first 100 percent H2 firing
demonstration of its nature in a consumer goods production
environment"

H2 View: "A brand-new hydrogen station is now fully operational in the
Netherlands – and it is refuelling 20 fuel cell buses in the town of
Heinenoord."

In my [costs](2022/02/costs-lcoe.md) doc I have the so-called nuclear
HTGR tech to have a low LCOH (levelized cost of H2).
$17.55/Gigajoules is pretty good. Initial (overnight) costs can be
high, and there is the waste issue, but hey, overall not too
shabby.

Power supply is tight..

The one pic I saw of Fin PM she had this Mmm-kay expression, now I
associate a lot of Fin news with that image; nuclear reactor on, had
to do it, m-kay?

Gov is more at fault to be sure but most of the folks in Congress went
along with Russia Russia Russia when they didn't have to, and likely
contributed to a future crisis that could be averted.

Most cryptos have predefined number of coins, no new money will be
created past certain time. Is this the answer?

I would not want a system that disallows new money creation by
design.. Money creation through private channels may not the way to
go, but through digital UBI which can be lent to businesses, as
"public credit" cld be a way? 

Such UBI could be somewhat inflationary but that's good, existing
wealth would be inflated away. 

---

'Private money creation has negative consequences' he says.. Because
it potentially allows limitless growth, with material usage
[implications](2021/03/less-is-more-hickel.md), and environmental
impact? He could be right.. 

---

He admitted BTW bank credit is newly created money. Most econs are not
even aware this is the case; their monkey theories always talk about
money being 'the veil of barter' - a completely false claim.

"In August the outgoing governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney,
gave an interesting speech on ‘The growing challenges for monetary
policy in the current international monetary and financial system’, in
which he set out how the dollar based global monetary order is
untenable and will need replacing by a new system...

Carney has proposed a ‘synthetic hegemonic currency’ as a possible
basis for a new global monetary system. This would be comprised of a
number of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), as put forward by
Positive Money. A CBDC would provide a trusted public alternative to
private banks’ monopoly on electronic money, and would move us towards
a system where commercial banks are not freely able to create new
money as debt, as they currently do to massive negative economic,
social and environmental consequences.

Carney said the introduction of such CBDCs would 'be to the benefit of
citizens and businesses', and is a reform to the monetary system which
'could happen.' In fact the Bank of England is currently exploring the
idea"

For full-blown game dynamic result talk to Dr Bruce M. He has a
consulting company now I hear.. But the final outcome will probably be
close to the one below.

---

68 suggests a final outcome closer to Russia's position. No Nato,
neutral, but maybe with some military presence, and some sanctions
remain in place?

---

```python
import pandas as pd, io
df = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(data))

def weighted_mode(df):
    df['w'] = df.Clout*df.Salience 
    df['w'] = df['w'] / df['w'].sum()
    df['w'] = df['w'].cumsum()
    return float(df[df['w']>=0.5].head(1).Position)    
def mean(df):
    return (df.Clout*df.Position*df.Salience).sum() / \
           (df.Clout*df.Salience).sum()

print ('mean voter %0.2f' % mean(df))
```

```text
mean voter 68.83
```

---

I assigned salience 70 to US, bcz strategically I dont think they give
a shit; stuff goes bad, Russia is outcast, EU-RU relation is screwed,
they still win.

---

Here is my raw data. Agree?

```python
data = """
Stakeholder,Clout,Position,Salience
Russia,70,100,100
Ukraine,40,40,100
USA,80,40,70
Europe,50,60,100
China,60,80,100
India,40,80,80
"""
```

---

Encode decision range as 0: Sanctions, Ukraine gov remains, no promise
on Nato, pre-war status continues, 100: All sanctions lifted, Ukraine
is neutral, demilitarized, no Nato.

Curious abt the "mean voter position" of the UKR-RU dynamic, talks,
per [here](2015/07/mesquita-game-theory-greece.md). Cranking some
numbers...
