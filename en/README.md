Best part of the speech (see link).

"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Ukraine"

[[-]](https://youtu.be/9_DMcayCtnA?t=1832)

Go for neutrality. Finlandization. Or maybe in the future we will call
it "Ukranianization".

"Ukraine agrees to hold talks with Russia at the Belarusian border"

---

Additional manpower, weapons did not help in Syria. Sanctions did not
help for post-Ukraine invasion 2014.

Trying to "shame" RU on moral grounds is useless. Even if they are an
evil force, there is a rational way to deal with them. Their actions
do not reflect on full democracy, as RU cannot claim to be one. But
democratically elected leaders, being responsible for the safety of
their citizens, are on the hook to provide safety. They need to have
the capability to handle this "evil force". You might be
democratically elected, but then have democratically get bit in the
ass by a wild bear, and democratically have your ass handed to you.

Its clearly about tanks, as we see now.

Not just tanks, I dont want to nag on the "weapon help" countries are
providing to UKR, even manpower, but it's more than that, you need to
have an integrated warfare capability just like RU (and US).

[2014] You don't need tanks, you need banks [against Putin]"

Vid on RU landmass

Canada is large. But you know who is larger? Russia. Twice the size of
Canada. Any analysis of this country needs to take that into account.

Dude in the back just dropped his magazine on the floor, WTF

Thats the guy - "Putin's son"

Reuters: "Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's Chechnya region and
an ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on Saturday that
Chechen fighters had been deployed to Ukraine and urged Ukrainians to
overthrow their government"

---

"India Avoids Condemning Russia's Invasion of Ukraine, Despite
U.S. Pressure"

---

"China refuses to call Russian attack on Ukraine an ‘invasion,’
deflects blame to U.S."
