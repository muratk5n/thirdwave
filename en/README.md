H2 Fuel News: "Houston, Texas-based Utility Global claims to have
invented the industry’s first non-electric electrolysis technology
platform for the ability to produce Net Zero hydrogen
conversion... The process is achieved by removing the external
electrical circuit from an electrolyser and instead driving the
electrolysis reaction with the over-potential (voltage) that exists
between different gas compositions"

If renewable energy gen increased 10-fold, that would reach a
respectable 20% of overall generation. But 20% ain't 100%, so need to
convert polluting fossil into non-poluting fuels in either case.

The display is approx the size of a small smartphone. Extremely compact.
The green piece is the RPi.

$130 Raspberry Pi 3

$35 4.3 inch Capacitive Touch Display 800×480 

$28 Keyboard 

Total roughly $200

---

One major adv here is RPi has full-blown Linux OS (not hidden behind
layers of crud like on Android), coding on it natively is possible,
without going through bizarre auxilary programs.

---

Bought a small touch display for Raspberry Pi computing board, hooked
up a wireless keyboard, now have a mobile computing platform. Bolt RPI
to the display, now the thing looks like a smartphone. Acts like it
too, with touch display!

Davis: "Supporting Ukraine For ‘As Long As It Takes’ Is Not A Strategy..

Russia was presumed to require an operational pause after taking
Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in late June, but current evidence
suggests that, to the contrary, Moscow has kept the pressure on the
Ukrainian defenders. When the Ukrainian troops withdrew from
Lysychansk, they repositioned along a new line of defense,
north-to-south from Seversk, to Soledar, to Bahkmut.

As of Thursday, Russian and Western media were reporting that Russian
troops were already in the outskirts of Seversk, and within a few
miles of both Soledar and Bahkmut – and all three are receiving
withering artillery and rocket fire, along with air strikes. Once
Russian forces break through this new line of defense, the twin-cities
of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk lie barely 25 miles to the west. The
Ukrainian troops would be hard-pressed to put up a successful defense
of either, as Russia could drive the attack with its forces from three
sides"

WION: "Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro says he knows how the Russia-Ukraine
war could be resolved.. 'The solution to this case would be like how
Argentina's war with the UK ended in 1982'. Bolsonaro didn't provide
any other details. [Falklands] war began in April 1982 when Argentine
troops landed on the British-controlled islands. The naval task force
was sent by Britain to retake them. Argentina surrendered two months
later"
