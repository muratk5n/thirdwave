What a f-ing joke this tech.. catches fire easily, relies on metal
that is rare, cannot be charged fully, charges slow, if charged too
fast degrades, or degrades anyway with even regular use... Which
blithering idiot thought this tech could ever be the route for clean
energy?

Don't charge to 100%?

DON'T NOT CHARGE TO 100%???

"At right-wing CPAC forum, Trump shows why he'll be tough to
topple.. Reminders of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s towering
influence over the Republican Party were everywhere at the annual
Conservative Political Action Conference this weekend near Washington.
There were kiosks hawking Trump hats and shirts, attendees sporting
'Make America Great Again' stickers and even a mock Oval Office where
attendees could be photographed next to Trump’s picture. The three-day
conference illustrated the iron grip he holds over the right-wing,
grassroots base of his party and how hard it could be for a challenger
to deny Trump the Republican presidential nomination in 2024"
