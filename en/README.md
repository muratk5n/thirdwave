H2 Central "[Dutch] OCI announced it will start construction of a
world-scale 1.1 million ton per annum blue ammonia project in
Beaumont, Texas, based on KBR technology. The passage of the US
Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the enhanced 45Q credits in the Act
strengthened the attractiveness of this project.

The US Gulf is a strategic location that allows the facility to serve
both the US market and export clean ammonia as a hydrogen carrier to
hydrogen deficit markets around the world such as Europe and Asia, as
well as catering for expected significant demand from new applications
including power and shipping fuels"

The EU is usually ahead on this stuff.. Individual countries are
advancing, some in a big way, but the EU level needs some more push?

throw a harsh light on EU’s strict additionality requirements, says
trade association [Hydrogen Europe, Chatzimarkakis]"

Not in the habit of using royal titles if those titles do not exist in
country I live in.. Never lived anywhere with a monarch, so I ignore

But people like Feinst supported Iraq War at first (which partly gave
rise to torture, or more torture), some found new religion later on
admitting they were duped, would've been better not to have gone in in
the first place.

*The Report*, movie abt the systemic US torture post 9/11. Lays out

in it. D. Feinstein in real life did something positive after all...

A meme is called for here: thug life. After a take down, people would
create animations dropping shades, hat, and a cig on someone's head

empire responsible for millions of deaths), just drop shades and a
cig.

---

With Koh-i-Noor Camilla will be like "it took me over 30 years but I
got here, I got jewels". Total gangsta. Imma get that crown with the
mammoth rock on it... Hell yea

---

or Mountain of Light — is a symbol of colonial subjugation and three
centuries of exploitation that began with the East India Company in
the early 17th century"
