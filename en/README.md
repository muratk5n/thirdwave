Bust the Filibuster

NYT: "[A]fter a Republican filibuster on Wednesday blocked the
Democrats’ latest proposal to combat the voting-rights restrictions
proliferating in red states, [Dems] now squarely faces the choice that
many activists consider an even more existential decision: whether it
will reform the filibuster to pass that legislation"

"[2019] The US military’s logistical train is slowly snaking toward
China... the center of military policy is increasingly gravitating
toward U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, according to U.S. government

Pacific theater is one of the most difficult environments for moving
supplies"
