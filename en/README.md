H2 Fuel News: "A busy week in the world of decarbonisation, with a key
event taking place in the House of Lords on Tuesday 1st November,
organised by the HyDeploy consortia.. HyDeploy2 delivered 20% blended
hydrogen with natural gas in a second trial for around 1,600 residents
in the village of Winlaton, near Gateshead"

Climate activists need to get into the weeds of climate tech and
policy.  Can't just call fossil companies bad names. Fossil companies
have a lot of know-how they can be helpful in the transition - given
we use the right tech.

---

It's not about whether to "bring back nuclear" - but *what kind*. The
defining feature of the new tech is not they are "small and modular"
either, MSM is off. The key word is helium-cooled - coupled with their
TRISO cartridges, making them safe. Spent fuel utilization is another
new way.

CHCFA: "The Canadian Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association (CHFCA) and
its members applaud the 2022 Fall Economic Statement presented by the
Honourable Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s Minister of Finance last week.

The statement, which highlights clean hydrogen as an essential part of
Canada’s net-zero future, outlines the government’s commitment to
accelerate hydrogen energy adoption through the new Canada Growth Fund
and investment tax credits for hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles
(FCEVs) and refueling infrastructure"

CENTO, now-defunct organization, was formed to contain, you guessed
it, Russia from its South, consisting of Iran, Iraq, Pakistan,
TR. Look at Britain, way the f--k over there in the West.

Everyone knows the radio speech of an '60 coup leader, "we are
respectful of NATO and CENTO". That guy later became the founder of an
ultra-nationalist party.

---

Tigger nationalists are useful idiots for the Anglo... Nat ideology
makes ppl feel foreign to their land ("just" arrived, nomadic
migrants) fear their neighbors, so they will be more in need of
overseas friends.

---

This takes me to the aughts, when an EU official's (Fogg) emails were
leaked to the press by this guy, EU-Anatolia relations were
damaged. Many thought the intel was given to him by RU FSB. MI6 makes
more sense - they would have more to gain - ala inner vs outer fight.

Name is Perincek. Turkist dickwad

Saw a vid, a retired TR spy chief just blurted out a politician,
"journalist" was actually in the employ of the Brits. Everyone thought
the fucker was Russian / Chinese asset.

Whatever her effect was earlier, on PA race, she'd made a difference
because she knew Oz personally, helped him become the big celebrity he
is today. As "character witness" for Oz her vote would count.

"Oprah's effect on politics is not as it used to be"

I realize SA has organization skill, she was helpful for 2020
get-out-the-vote efforts. But running for office herself apparently is
not her thing.

---

Beto and Stacy Abrahams got the crap beaten out of them. These are
perennial losers, I hope they stop trying to run for office, they are
taking up space, attention someone else can use, someone who can win
and gain governing experience.

Hochul win is good - strong supporter of H2

I like the emph on healthcare, working class

Fetterman: "I am proud of our campaign platform: protect women's right
to choose, raise the minimum wage, fight (for)
unionization.. Healthcare is a fundamental human right. It saved my
life, and it should be there for you too if you need it"
