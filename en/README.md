Can't use continuously; a waste of money.

"[If I am] cycling through my battery Powerwall every single day, I'm
actually degrading the battery, and the sooner that it's going to
basically be dead and unusable and you need to go buy another one. My
battery pack is only there for an emergency, like if something crazy
happens like the power goes out.. And when I say it's not worth the
money.. I could have taken that $20,000 that it cost to put these on
the wall, and I could have put a bunch more, maybe 20, maybe 30 more
solar panels on the house.  Every single day that would be generating
money for me and money for our house, decreasing the cost"

We examine[d] how the premature death of eminent life scientists
alters the vitality of their fields... To our surprise, it is not
competitors from within a subfield who assume the mantle of
leadership, but rather entrants from other fields who step in to fill
the void created by a star’s absence"

It's easy to create singularity in math. $f(x) = 1/x$. There. I just
created a singularity at $x=0$. The function is undefined there. Does
that mean there is a black hole at $x=0$?

---

To detail, if your spiffy new model shows a 'singularity' at a point
it doesn't mean there should be a black hole there. Equation is likely
wrong, should be corrected so it has no singularity. In measurements
the instruments never spit out a 'singularity measurement'. Whereever
you point to, there is always a measurement.

Math models do not lose accuracy, at first, due to discretization
(that comes later). They lose accuracy because math models
"oversmooth". You are representing phenomena based on finite particles
with something that works at infinitely fine scale. The tool helped us
for a long time, we could not (and still can't) simulate all particles
to compete with nature, math allowed scientists to research phenomena
without having a computer as big as nature. But let's not forget, it's
all an (oversmoothed) approximation.

Why Charles abdic and younger son Kang? It makes sense actually, from
PR point of view, if abdication is due to the Diana drama, who was the
black sheep in their family, after Charles it would make sense to make
another black sheep the Kang from PR standpoint. \#Nostradamus

"The mine was just inspected". If they are inspected on conformance to
insufficient regulations, then even the most diligent inspection would
not be useful.

I remember an accident in 2014, it made history when an advisor to PM
did Italian karate on a protestor (he was sacked).

GEM Wiki: "Mining accidents are common in [TR], which has poor
mine-safety conditions. According to a report issued in 2010 by
[TEPAV], in 2008, deaths per 1 million tons of coal mined were
7.22.. (the highest figure in the world), 5 times the rate in China
(1.27) and 361 times the rate in the US (0.02)"
