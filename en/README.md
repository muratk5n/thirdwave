If I ever quit academia, it will be because of the sheer volume of
admin work that is being piled on us PIs. It's non-stop and is coming
from all directions including the Univ. Attending training sessions,
filling out forms etc is becoming my nth full-time job and I am fed
up...

To use the latest iteration of some user-unfriendly software to do
admin jobs that used to be done by support staff in the Dept/Univ.. in
the name of cost savings and 'efficiency' [sucks].. more of these
duties are falling to us. And all of this takes a lot of time"

Consa: "In 1949, the USSR had obtained the atomic bomb thanks to
information provided by.. a Manhattan Project researcher with
communist sympathies. From then on, espionage accusations became
widespread among the American scientific community. Senator McCarthy
began a witch hunt in which Oppenheimer was accused of treason and had
to submit to trial. The witch hunt ended in 1957, when the Russians
sent the Sputnik satellite into space and the US government realized
that it needed scientists to create NASA and win the space race"

Consa: "[Dyson said in 2006, as] one of the inventors of QED, I
remember that we thought of QED in 1949 as a temporary and jerry-built
structure, with mathematical inconsistencies and renormalized
infinities swept under the rug. We did not expect it to last more than
10 years before some more solidly built theory would replace it. Now,
57 years have gone by and that ramshackle structure still stands."
