It's highly likely H2 boilers, such as the one sold by [Worcester Bosch](https://www.worcester-bosch.co.uk/hydrogen),
can handle impurities in fuel (combustion has a way of 'handling' such things
-by just burning it off-), so ammonia-converted H2 can also be used in a H2
boiler scenario.

*The Gray Man*, definitely watching that

Hah someone called *Dune* characters Bene Gesserit "Ninja Nuns". That

when their shitcos were up 10x the market was being totally rational"

All religion is at its inception left-wing. Then it is co-opted by the
system, it becomes a mere extension of it.
See [Morris](2021/05/farmers-foragers-fossils.html#olddeal)

Representation is out of whack.. Culture Codes matter more (which is
Protestan for US), the judges are 'merican culturally, but to the
extent their religion effects political choices, the balance is off.

Gallup: "22% of the adult population [in US] identifies as Catholic,
as opposed to the 67% Catholic representation on the [Supreme Court]"

Pro-life position isn't necessarily Christian; but it is definitely
*Roman* (Catholic). Rome needed soldiers. Rome is gone, but some of
its culture lives on, through the Church.

Degenerate discussions on \#MeToo, too much \#Woke is
Gender. Bulllshit LGBT issues are Gays, denialism, culture war around
climate is Green, abortion related to God (though different religions
seem to be interpreting that God differently).

---

US stuck on 5G - Guns, Gays, Green, God, Gender.

But 'crops' would be easier to get at in some settings so they would
be prefered, but that comes with its own social problems (kings,
landowning, bizarre religions, goat girlfriend). Humans domesticate
plants, then are domesticated by them.

Hunting, fishing diet needs no 'supplementing' BTW.

Crops and pyramids - they go hand in hand.

"@WSJscience

Scientists discovered ancient Amazonian settlements including pyramids
as tall as eight-story buildings in Bolivia.. Researchers used a
helicopter equipped with light detection and ranging (lidar) equipment
to scan a total area of 77 square miles, since the details of the
settlements were not visible from the ground..

The settlements are believed to have been built by the Casarabe
culture in what is now Bolivia between about 600 and 1,500 years
ago. They successfully cultivated maize and other crops, supplementing
their diets with protein from hunting and fishing"

"Babylonians already knew Newton's Method!". M-f-ker did Babylonians

then?

"When the transistor density doubles, clock rate can go up 1.4x, while
power consumption stays the same (despite having twice the number of
transistors running faster). Ceased to apply [since] ~2005 (because
leakage became significant), [now]

- Clock speed bounded

- Energy consumption becomes critical

- Drive to many core machines [bcz single 'core' cannot go faster anymore]"
