H2 View: "Sweden’s ‘first’ hydrogen truck to soon hit roads.. Swedish
transport group MaserFrakt will bring what it says will be Sweden’s
first hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck into commercial operation
across the country – and today it placed the all-important order with
Hyzon Motors. Marking a milestone moment for Sweden’s transportation
industry, the company will deploy two Hyzon HyMax-250 fuel cell
electric trucks, built on a 6×4 vehicle chassis, each with a range of
up to 680 kilometres"

H2 View: "The HyDeal European green [H2 project]..  will bring a total
installed capacity to 9.5 GW of solar power and 7.4 GW of
electrolyzers..  by 2030.

The European strategy’s announcement arrived as India and Brazil made
their own announcements"

H2 View: [A] joint venture last month said it will develop what it
believes to be the UK’s largest hydrogen hub as part of the HyNet
cluster across the Northwest of England and North Wales... 'Best in
class' technology supplied from Johnson Matthey will allow for high
purity low carbon hydrogen production from natural gas at the site,
delivering over 85% thermal efficiency and ~97% carbon capture, the
report states.

SolarPACES: "Particles like sand or specially manufactured ceramic
particles have been shown to hold heat at 1000°C and above, and so
particle-based solar tower CST technologies are now much
investigated..

[Researchers are] investigating twirling the particles around inside
the solar receiver. Two examples of the circulating approach are DLR’s
Centrec receiver in Germany, operating like a cement mixer, has
recently advanced into its first commercial pilots via the spin-off
HelioHeat... The Swiss laboratory ETH developed another design, now
further developed by the DLR spin-off Synhelion..

Very high temperature solar research is even more relevant in sunny
Australia where large mining industries have world class potential to
decarbonize using this solar technology for generating heat directly
for their industrial processes, like alumina processing. One such
receiver is under development, a project funded by Australian
Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), by an innovative team of researchers
at the University of Adelaide"

Texas has a bright future, H2 production will be a boon for the state
just as oil had been. They have the sunshine and expertise in handling
various chemicals, transporting, storing, processing them.. If there
was a stock for the state I'd buy it

---

You know once setup the Japanese will have a string of those ships
lined up, working around the clock, sailing back-to-back forming
almost a semi-pipeline through the sea, to get the H2 from
Australia. Massive energy transportation is possible, perhaps in
bigger amounts than oil.

Automation (not AI) works well... 

The Mandarin: "Japan wants to make half Its cargo ships autonomous by
2040.. The first was a 313-foot container ship called the Mikage,
which sailed 161 nautical miles from Tsuruga Port, north of Kyoto, to
Sakai Port near Osaka. Upon reaching its destination port the ship was
even able to steer itself into its designated bay, with drones
dropping its mooring line.

The Mikage wasn’t purpose-built to be autonomous; the seven-year-old
ship was retrofitted with a system of sensors, cameras, and satellite
navigation. It followed a carefully-planned route while a control
centre on land monitored relevant wind, current, and weather data, as
well as details on nearby ships and potential obstacles.

Similar to how it’s easier for self-driving cars to operate
autonomously on highways than in unpredictable urban settings, the
Mikage didn’t have too hard of a time navigating itself through open
waters"

But still upcoming sanctions can damage EU-RU bilateral relations for
a long time to come. Mission accomplished (for UK/US, per scenario).

---

In this scenario a surgical strike against the UKR government is the
play, and the attack plan cld be like this guy says. 

"@KofmanMichael

I made a basic map... This is just one very incomplete estimate of
what the Russian op plan might look like"

It is claimed Macron suggested "Finlandization" to VZ in a recent
meeting. Not followed. EM had a non-antagonistic stance toward RU, one
of the few leaders to receive one-on-one meeting with Pute, at that
long table.

And Zelensky did not reach agreement when he could..

The plot thickens..

Al Jazeera: "We will also soon find out whether Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy did the right thing when he chose to put up a
fight rather than avoid collusion by accepting his country’s neutral
status or agreeing to implement the Minsk agreements, as Russia
demanded prior to the invasion"

[[-]](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/2/24/is-putins-gamble-on-ukraine-rational)

---

But let's continue: Putin was provoked through NATO. Brits had their
bitch, Asia Minor, to help UKR stage drone attacks toward the
seperatists in UKR East.

---

After one Biden-Zelensky meeting (May 2021) talk of "NATO membership"
made the news, later denied, but VZ cld have received a tentative
agreement on NATO in that meeting. Then denial.. Puten either saw that
as weakness, or was scared.

---

If one accepts the great fear of US-UK was a EU-RU entente, the latest
invasion has been a "gift".

OK.. let's get diabolical

---

UKR conf happened right on time for WH; now Russia can be blamed for
all gas price rises.

---

US is probably fine with the system as is.. They are the only ones
with all fingers in all pies, can pick and choose any combo of
responses depending on the crisis, that benefits them.

---

The world system is a joke.. What use is it to pass resolution at UNSC
when RU (a permanent member) can veto it right away?

---

Al Jazeera: "Hedge in times of trouble? Bitcoin drops to one-month
low"

---

Al Monitor: "US sanctions smuggling network backing Yemen's Houthis"

---

Really? NATO is sitting ducks?

Jane's Defense: "NATO loses ISR capability over Ukraine as Putin closes
airspace.. NATO has lost its ability to conduct airborne intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) overflights of Ukraine"
