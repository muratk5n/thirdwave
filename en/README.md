"Buffalo mayor-to-be India Walton a ‘very proud’ democratic
socialist.. 'We will bail out Wall Street and banks and give a billion
dollars in tax incentives to one of the richest people in the world to
build an empty Tesla factory in South Buffalo, and when it comes to
providing the resources that working families need to thrive,
socialism becomes scary at that point. So, I’m very proud to be a
democratic socialist. I am proud to have the support of Buffalo DSA
and national DSA (Democratic Socialists of America)"

*Apache Junction*, a story on journalism really, albeit in a Wild West
context.. Thumbs up

UCDP/PRIO conflict stats update. Fall in Mozambique, Afghanistan
(obviously).  Egypt is always up there.. the place is never settling
down. Somalia, Nigeria, in turmoil as before.  Increase of deaths in Pakistan,
Yemen. The latter looks pretty bad actually.

Where are our American friends? Center of research, noone stepping up?
Europe did its part. Euler, Navier, Stokes, Laplace gave you the
proper model (the [cat's cradle](2021/09/computing-ai.md)), but now
noone can work the model and get answers, centuries later? That SciAm
article has the Who Is Who of the field, they are all scratching their
heads.. F-ing McLean produces literature, but I've never in my life
read a book explaning what something isn't rather than what it is, in
its entirety.

We cant explain lift.. weird. The math model for aerodynamics is
known. Compsci can compute all flow around a wing using it, and can
show the pressure gradients. Today. That model could be interrogated
for certain patterns of shapes, mathematically.. Why isn't this done?

Reminds me of [this](2013/12/cost-gravity.md) Hintjens commentary..

Politico: "President Joe Biden's decision to nominate Cornell law
professor Saule Omarova to regulate the nation's banks is triggering
intense anxiety among the lenders and their Washington lobbyists and
threatens to set off a bruising battle in Congress.

Omarova is more than just a finance industry critic — she has proposed
essentially ending the banking industry as we know it by letting the
Federal Reserve take on the deposit accounts of all Americans"
