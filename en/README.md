After the fall of the Berlin Wall this was the state the Dems were in;
lost in the woods, with a major chip on their shoulder, in a "copy
Reps or die" attitude. If Reps deregulate, you do too. If they are for
NAFTA, you are too. With so much agreement, politics was reduced to
arguing over climate, abortion, guns, blowjobs; there was nothing else left.

The book *The Meat Racket*: "GIPSA [is] the antitrust regulator that
was created before the Great Depression specifically to regulate
U.S. meat companies...  gained its authority over meat companies from
a law called the Packers and Stockyards Act, which was passed in 1921.
The act was passed with the goal of breaking up the 'meat
trust,' a collection of five companies that controlled about 85
percent of the market (a lesser degree of concentration than existed
in 2000).

By 2005, GIPSA seemed to have drawn into a shell of
nonenforcement. The reasons were partly due to the reorganization
overseen by James Baker, the Stetson-wearing GIPSA chief who ran the
agency during the Clinton era.  Baker’s prime initiative as the
antitrust regulator was to reshape the agency in the image of the
highly concentrated meat industry that it oversaw"

It's Bill Clinton's fault

It is deliberative because of the six year term. The system pays you,
Mr Senator, for six years so u feel less of a pressure the House deals
with, and ponder some stuff, not to make the entire system grind to a
halt.

"But the Senate is a 'deliberative body' the filibuster is a big part of that"
