Nordstream 1,2 leaks at three points.. Likely sabotage. Cui bono?  Who
doesn't want energy links between Russia and Europe, especially
between RU-DE?

They buy from Australia, Canada, Kazakhstan, I see.  Uranium energy
output is astronomical justifies its price tag surely. A lot of bang
-ahem- for the buck.

---

It looks like Japan doesn't have uranium (either)..

Certain H2 setups can generate heat as a by-product, fuel-cells, LOHC
dehydrogenation process... One demo setup shows liquid carrier dehyd
heating an entire swimming pool.

---

Think the whole ecosystem too - clean gas is transmitted 10 times
faster at 8th the cost. Even if fuel generates electricity at end
points heat-pumps runs on that, overall perf would be more optimal
than the naive pure-grid based scenario.

Boiler Hut: "1kg of hydrogen releases the same energy as 2.8kg of natural gas."

H2 based heating is efficient as H2 HHV is more than twice that of natgas.

You either blow the fuse at home or at the local [transformer](https://aemo.com.au/-/media/files/stakeholder_consultation/consultations/nem-consultations/2020/draft-2020-isp/submissions/paul-matthews-submission-draft-2020-isp.pdf). 
The tech is crap. It needs to be abandoned asap.

blowing the fuse"

The capitalist is such a little bitch. Everything needs to be the way
they want, their playground needs to be all nicely defined, with nice
toys in it, be monitored, but ew dont interfere too much, until
something bad happens, then interfere big time and make it go away.

Market competition my ass.. Big pharma pushed for the inclusion of
this clause in 2003 bcz they did **not** want the buyer (government)
to negotiate, as any buyer would in any trade (sure gov is a big buyer
but can't there be big customers in the market?). IRA is amending that
no?  Negotiation ability can help people..

"Medicare Part D [included] a “noninterference clause” that protects
market competition and patient access by prohibiting the government
from interfering in negotiations among insurers, drug manufacturers,
and pharmacies"

Earlier write-up on the tech

The HDS product suite handles conversion of H2 to LOHC (hydrogenation)
and taking H2 out of LOHC (dehydrogenation). Storage capacity of the
products isn't even listed; IMO storage is practically unlimited,
anywhere diesel is stored, the organic carrier can be
stored. Conversion rates are reported (2018), 400 m3/h hyd, and 640
liter/h dehyd.

---

Could oil pipelines can be repurposed to carry LOHC since it is an
oil-like substance? Natgas pipelines with some refurb carry H2 gas,
oil pipelines carry this liquid.

---

LOHCs, Liquid Organic Hydrogen Carriers, have seen some commercial
development lately, there is a suite of products from a company called
Hydregenious, partnered with MAN Diesel&Turbo (known name in the
petro-chemical industry). If advertisement is true, H2 can be
transported as an oily, diesel-like substance, at room temperature,
inert.. Therefore any infra (trucks, trailers) that can carry oil can
be used to carry LOHC.

---

"A report.. [claims] that the bulk of the.. hydrogen [transport]
around the world will be split between pipelines and liquid organic
hydrogen carriers (LOHC), often transported in ships"
