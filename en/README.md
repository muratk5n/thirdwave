can meet the performance needs of heavier-duty vehicles such as HGVs

Yahoo Finance: "ExxonMobil said today it is planning a hydrogen
production plant and one of the world‚Äôs largest carbon capture and
storage projects at its integrated refining and petrochemical site at
Baytown, Texas..  The proposed hydrogen facility would produce up to 1
billion cubic feet per day of "blue" hydrogen, which is an industry
term for hydrogen produced from natural gas and supported by carbon
capture and storage. The carbon capture infrastructure for this
project would have the capacity to transport and store up to 10
million metric tons of CO2 per year, more than doubling ExxonMobil‚Äôs
current capacity"

They produce the neutral fuels by mixing in carbon into a clean fuel,
turning it into synthetic fossil fuel which existing engines are
prepared for. If the carbon is captured "from the air" then putting it
back through combustion would not change the overall budget, voila.

Cant say I'm crazy about the approach, creates a path too easy to
cheat. Remember Volkswagen, a world famous company, w production at
huge scale, headquartered smack in the middle of Europe still cheated
on their emissions mechanism.. With synthetic fuels one day companies
might just burn some coal on the side, get its carbon, then we will be
back to square one.

"@FlySWISS and its parent company, the @lufthansa Group, have partnered
with synthetic fuel group Synhelion to use its solar fuel"

I culled this guy's script to fourth its size. The spaghetti in the

IT has a long history now around adopting, popularizing, marketing
packages; lots depend on them. Each has its own way of use / access,
and professionals want to learn a few, stick to that, and sell it,
"evangalize" it to others. They mostly have no bleeping idea about
what goes on inside.

---

This is another reason why this "AI" talk is prevalent, bcz IT types
picked up on it, they see it as a nice "package". And current
incarnation of this said AI is exactly that, a black box essentially,
you shove data into from one end, "predictions" come out from the
other (which of course is the problem as far as AGI is concerned).

---

These are such common operations they are known as C.R.U.D. - 
create, read, update, delete.

---

Yes there are funcs for delete dumb ass [eyes rolling]

---

IT profession today is mostly about packages, Gone are the days of a
"hacker" coding up everything from scratch (Linus Torvalds is probably
the last famous one who did). Now it's all about a package, picking
one, learning one.. IT professionals do not write a database from
scratch to insert a new record. There is a database *package* and they
just call a function named `insert` in that package, passing data as
parameter, and voila. A new record.

I hope the Klitschkos make it. Everyone too of course, but if those
guys get killed it will be a huge bummer.

Leaders don't stand alone either. Democratic ones rely on a larger
winning coalition, but even the most autocratic leader has a WC. When
Putin annexed Crimea Gorbachev was cheering that shit.

These wars are fought at another level.. Just like regular individual
is insufficient for modern governance but people's romantic notions of
'community governance' remains, so is 'civic bravity' in modern war.
WWI, WWII should have beaten that out of societies but people forget.

---

Modern war is not unlike a natural disaster, sudden, faceless,
overwhelming, and destructive. There is no mano-o-mano, bravity
against it. If you are in its path, you get destroyed.

---

Ukranian guy I was following was like 'we will fight!' but then he got
the f-k outa there, over a week ago.

I dont think Ukranians are any more Nazi then Russians themselves are.
