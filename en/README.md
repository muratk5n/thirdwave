SPD looks to be in the lead in Germany.. Its leader Schulz made some
comments about a possible coalition with leftist party Die Linke. Of
course shitlib, libcuck, limpdicks piled on him, but I hope he follows
through.. If he does, they could be in a similar situation to US Dems,
w Biden and the Dem left. Greens too

Dems definitely wouldn't want that 10-past-10 square brother [either](https://youtu.be/IFqVNPwsLNo?t=1694)).

Good.. Doesnt matter how GN did, recall needs to fail. The alternative
is mob rule. Less direct democracy.

'California Gov. Newsom and allies spent $36 million in August alone to
fight the recall"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
