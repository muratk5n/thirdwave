Paper: "Dr Lex van Loon [writes] the biggest concern [with space
flight] is prolonged exposure to microgravity - near zero gravity -
which, combined with exposure to damaging radiation from the Sun,
could cause 'fundamental' changes to the body"

David Mumford (Fields medal winner) started some work around the
mathematics of intelligence, pattern recognition, in a book on what he
calls "pattern theory"; this direction needs to be explored further
IMO. 

---

Mainstream "AI" research is moving in a completely wrong
direction. They need to reverse course, and correct.

---

Example: There is a term in FD formulas that says 'if there is a
pressure difference between two regions there will be a force between
those regions, from high to low'. This is the type of formula AI, or
AGI needs, not "neurons". Observe external variables (via experiments,
trial/error), then using mathematics create releations among them. AGI
needs to follow the same approach adopted by nearly all natural
sciences. What are the variables of intelligence? What is the Calculus
that can bind them together? These need to be invented. It isn't about
"computation", not at first, brogrammers still don't get this..  It's
about declarative, broad relations, finding the ever-present pattern
among them, like making a cat's cradle. Starting with one set of
relations, transforming it another, it goes on.. Then as a *last*
step, you can compute.

---

There is a fluid dynamics *formula* that works for any point in space,
point in time, at macro level.. We "discretize" that formula, chop it up
into pieces for computation and program that into the computer, much
later. This is a different approach then using micro particles trying
to build up to a system. As with many other things bottom up approach
doesn't work, need to work top-down. High organization matters. 

---

We don't simulate fluids as particles

"[Deep] neural nets will give us true AI, intelligence is all about
neurons, if we can simulate enough neurons we can simulate the brain,
just like simulating water with many (water) particles"

If there are 10 dead/injured per building on avg, the current reported
figures may double in the future.

But Al Jazeera has good content overall, and a fair take on the
Israel/Palestine issue. Glad AJ is available.

---

Qatar (who finances Al Jazeera) must still be butthurt from not being
able to topple Assad after all that money spent to achieve it. I look
at my timeline (below); there are gazillion of other events between
that amnesty and, say, the capture of Falluja in 2014 by ISIS, years
later.

:) Al Jazeera docu says Assad released (Sunni) political prisoners
which created ISIS

Rage Against The War Machine - organized by Libertarian Party and the
People's Party. Catchy title. Good event. I like it. Make
noise.. little cacerolazo.. good trouble.

Ohio governor (R) was grilled pretty well on Fox & Friends - and they
