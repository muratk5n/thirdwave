JCB, developer of the world’s first working construction machines
powered by hydrogen, today unveiled another world first for the
industry - a mobile hydrogen refueller. JCB is investing £100 million
in a project to produce super-efficient hydrogen engines and has
already showcased working prototypes of a backhoe loader and Loadall
telescopic handler powered by hydrogen.

Deep neural nets are usde in ad-hoc fashion, shove data from one end,
turn the crank, it spits out some stuff from the other end. Their
non-scientific nature made them a dead-end for AGI. Any theoretical
connection is a good thing.

TabPFN has a connection to theory, that's good; they can *prove*
something, an approximation to Bayesian inference. In effect TabPFN is
almost an implementation of theory, as FVM can implement CFD
equations.

Problems in a Second.. TabPFN is radically different from previous ML
methods. It is a meta-learned algorithm and it provably approximates
Bayesian inference"

"The US Department of Energy (DOE) has released a draft National Clean
Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap, which sets out three key priorities:
the targeting of strategic, high-impact uses of hydrogen; reducing the
cost of clean hydrogen to $1/kg by 2031; and focusing on the
deployment of at least four regional clean hydrogen hubs"

H2 Central: "Members of The European Parliament Have Decided to
Support a Hydrogen Based Green Transition in The Transport
Sector.. Was another important day for hydrogen economy in Europe and
globally...

[The target of a] maximum distance of 100km between each hydrogen
refuelling station, along both the core and comprehensive TEN-T
networks, will mean that by the time the infrastructure is in place by
end of 2027, up to 1,780 HRS could be available across Europe,
suppling up to 1 million ton of hydrogen per year"

The new eLife approach can work... Every submitted paper is
automatically available (not 'rejected', or 'accepted'), publisher
assesment is still included with the published paper, others' comments
also visible, and the author can resubmit.

I'm thinking incentives.. prestigious publishers can still exist, to
the extent they can pull prestigious reviewers, the add-on they
provide will be those reviews. Readers would still be able to get a
feel of a up/down vote on the paper, but the paper is available either
way, available for others to see/comment.
