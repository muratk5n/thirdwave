How abt paying back the principal part...? Borrower still needs munee
for that, if sold assets you are back to the original problem.

Lender cld actually be selling the asset themselves, part of a stock
buyback scheme of borrower's company maybe (lender -usually a broker
too- sells the stock back to the company, not triggering any tax
requirement for the borrower, or the lender)?

"A pledged-asset mortgage is recommended for borrowers that have the
cash or investments available and don't want to sell their investments
to pay for the down payment. Selling the investments might trigger tax
obligations to the IRS...

The asset is merely collateral for the lender in the event of borrower
default. However, for the borrower, the pledged asset could help
considerably with gaining approval for the loan. Using the asset to
secure the note may let the borrower demand a lower interest rate on
the note then they would have had with an unsecured loan. Typically,
pledged-asset loans provide borrowers with better interest rates than
unsecured loans.

Once the loan is paid off and the debt is fully satisfied, the lender
transfers the pledged asset back to the borrower"

They usually borrow against their stocks in their own companies it seems

"The wealthiest Americans avoided billions in taxes .. America's
billionaires have often financed their lavish lifestyles by using
their vast fortunes as collateral for loans, which can come with
single-digit interest rates"

Snowden: "The first thing I do when I get a new phone is take it
apart. I donâ€™t do thisÂ to satisfy a tinkererâ€™s urge, or out of
political principle, but simply becauseÂ it is unsafe to
operate. Fixing the hardware, which is to say surgically removing the
two or three tiny microphones hidden inside, is only the first step of
an arduous process, and yet even after days of these DIYÂ security
improvements, my smartphone will remain the most dangerous item I
possess..

I canâ€™t help but regard theÂ arrival of theÂ Pegasus ProjectÂ as a
turning-pointâ€”a well-researched, exhaustively-sourced, and frankly
crazy-making story..

In short, the phone in your hand exists in a state of perpetual
insecurity, open to infection by anyone willing to put money in the
hand of this new Insecurity Industry"

The level of fail in analysing TR's predicament by the previous gen is
mind-boggling. These ppl pretty much sleep walked their entire
lives. Do the tally, almost noone is left unscathed.. and believe me I
know some of their smartest. Sad.

So we pay Kaiser 30,000 dollars per year for so called health
insurance and Friday my wife brought our 16 YO in for an MRI on doctor
recommendation (sheâ€™s fine). Copay was $200. Unreal"

Why do I open source? U see what's going on inside, feel better. Or
bcz it's free, carry the code (and its associated skillset) from
project to project, from one employment to next (next employer will
likely also buy into it bcz it's free), so OSS gradually becomes
everyone's favorite portable toolkit.

Open Source isn't some hold-hands-kumbaya approach to software
development. When I send a patch (or now create a 'pull request') to a
project to fix a bug, or to improve something, I do it for selfish
reasons. I want those changes in there so next time I get the latest
code from that project I get the new stuff plus my changes. I
obviously do this for project whose code I need.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
