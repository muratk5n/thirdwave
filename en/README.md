The mask was not iron.. ? The movie with that name was based on a lie!
How could that be! 

Wiki: "The Man in the Iron Mask [of France]... was an unidentified
prisoner who was arrested in 1669 or 1670... No one is known to have
seen his face, as it was hidden by a mask of black velvet cloth, later
misreported by Voltaire as an iron mask"

Gold is such a useless thing. Plus its mining is toxic as hell. Its
use should be discouraged, as jewelry, as a commodity, certainly as a
"store of value".

Al Jazeera: "Toxic City: The Cost of Gold Mining in South Africa.. Mountains of waste
from Johannesburg’s omnipresent gold industry may be ruining the
health of nearby residents"

How to write lines for Sam Jackson? Basically think of stuff that
could come before a .. comma motherfucker.. Like you could think of
"is the sun coming up?" line by thinking of "is the sun coming up,
motherfucker?", then just dropping the last word.
