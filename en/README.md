IPS: "What makes banks like JPMorgan, Citi, and Morgan Stanley so
eager to extend these billions in loans — to the rich — at such low
interest rates? One reason: The loans come as close to risk-free as
risk-free could be. A more important reason: Big banks cherish close
relationships with extremely rich people. These rich often run
extremely large corporate empires and can steer their corporate
banking business to the banks that cater to their personal needs...

The best antidote to this gaming of the federal income tax? That may
be the wealth tax legislation that Senator Elizabeth Warren from
Massachusetts introduced this past spring with Representatives Pramila
Jayapal of Washington State and Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania"

movies.. Directors will pick you when they need "a scifi type person".

Studded with scifi actors.. understandable given the subject matter.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
