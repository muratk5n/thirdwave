That actually makes sense; if they cannot explain lift in
aerodynamics, they wont be able to explain surfing either... IMO both

"The physics of surfing is an enigma. In particular, it is unproven
how a surfboard accelerates across a wave, and how a surfboard can
grip the water with sufficient force to allow a surfer to stand at the
tip.. There is no proven or accepted explanation of surfing supported
by evidence and experimentation. Surfing has evolved by intuition,
trial, and error"

Even the most white-collar, pro-globalization pols started talking
about 'workers'. Such worries were previously confined to the realm of
immigrants (or slave labor working abroad), no need to give much lip

involves natives, everyone talks about them, it's the stuff of
internal politics.
