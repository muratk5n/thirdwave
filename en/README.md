The presence of such massive supply at the consumer's doorstep can
spur development of more end-use products; eg carmakers they will
speed up FCEV production, we'll probably see more products around
portable canisters, etc. Supply is key. Aplenty will attract aplenty.

H2 transition can be in stages; Gov can first encourage production,
and distribution of H2 to cities via pipelines. If homes do not have
CHP, gas heating units, then gas is converted to electricity at a
local hub, the last mile remains the same. Later as people convert
their units at home, they can get the gas directly from city pipeline.

Most of those ew-money-printing-bad-so-bad-poop-fiat-gold-gold-gold
crowd u see in "certain media" are serving the interests of an
anti-dollar lobby, non-leading powers jealous their currency is not
the main one. Printing per-se isn't bad, the issue is who you print it
*for*. There is always printing. Plus developed countries aren't
foolish enough to end up like bleeping Venezuella. Then if there is
inflation, we can suspect wage increases, or supply issues, or both.

It happens to be one of the core tenets of econ.. time to hit the books?

Cld also be supply issues of course

"You said wage rises causes inflation.. I dont understand"

NYT: "[Senator Manchin], the Democrat from coal-rich West Virginia
whose vote is crucial to passage of the bill, has told the White House
that he strongly opposes the clean electricity program... As a result,
White House staffers are now rewriting the legislation without that
climate provision, and are trying to cobble together a mix of other
policies that could also cut emissions"
