Party-pooper indeed..

On average reserves increased by 2.4% annually. Latest increase was 0.46%.

Besides that new action offshore around Surinam we don't hear any big
news anymore on oil finds, do we? Where is the next Ghawar? That big
bonanza of energy?

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('oil-proved-reserves.csv')
df = df[df.Entity=='World'].set_index('Year')
print ('%',np.round(df['Oil - Proved reserves'].pct_change().mean()*100.0,2))
print ('%',np.round((1732-1724)/1724*100.0,2))
```

```text
% 2.4
% 0.46
```

---

For 2020 that number was 1,732 gboe, last number represent a modest
increase.

Oil and Gas Journal: "According to [our] annual assessment, the
world’s proved oil reserves total 1,724.5 billion bbl at yearend 2021"

Oman has sunshine, has great access to the high seas. Perfect industry
for them. Export clean molecules to India, Europe, even Japan.

What happens to the global price of crude? Who cares? There is a US
price, an EU price, so on..

---

And here we are discussing effin fossil.. I ask for new refineries
that can produce clean molecules with CCS.

---

Put two and two together; US looking at refining capacity, has
crude.. Maybe US will simply stop exporting, refine its own oil and
release to the market, reintroducing the export ban? That'll get you
an additional 8 mb/d of oil pretty quick. US could essentially double
its supply of gasoline and halve the price.

---

"In 2021, the United States exported about 8.63 million barrels per day
(b/d) and imported about 8.47 million b/d of petroleum"

They didn't use the biggest bullet. You are thinking too global, too
free market son

Yahoo: "Gas prices have hit record highs but don't expect Biden to
lower them: 'They already used their biggest bullet' [meaning the use
of petroleum reserves]"

Protest fine, but can we not burn f-ing tires?

---

Not even June yet but already had a 'feels like 39 C' day.

---

This is not some Zen koan or ancient parable. It comes from
mathematical optimization. Optimizing algorithms look for global
minima (or maxima) all the time, and they always try not to get stuck
at "local solutions". 

---

In that case climb down, apply same technique in a different
direction, or try to see two steps ahead if possible; meaning take a
planning two-steps ahead not just one.

---

The one-step vs two-step solution issue is related to tactical
wins. Imagine being outside, during a fog, night time, how to reach
the top of a highest near hill? Simple solution - always move in the
uphill direction. Works remarkably well. Even if we lose long distance
vision, improving the current situation builds up in the long-run,
leads to global solution.

But, one can still get stuck on a "local minima". Because we didn't
look ahead, could have climbed the nearest *shorter* hill.

Jenin, the place where that poor female journalist was killed
recently, is in northern West Bank. Jenin is obviously behind the
wall, but still under military occupation. Extremely poor, workers
from there have to pass through checkpoints, with permits, to enter
Israel to work.

---

If Gaza and West Bank are both surrounded by walls, why the need for
the military occupation, in the West Bank? The walls also create a
Palestian state already. Egypt takes Gaza, West Bank declares
statehood, w East Jerusalem as the capital. Absent the one-state
solution, is this workable?

Didn't PM May say "no UK prime minister could ever agree" to an Irish
Sea border? Well there is one now. There is a customs border in the
Irish Sea. That means Brexiters broke the UK to 'deliver Brexit'. They
cut themselves off from the EU which forced them to cut UK into pieces

---

They haven't delivered shit. They swept the hard issues under the
carpet, or didn't even address them, ending up with worst of both
worlds. Those issues are coming back to bite them in the ass now.

"Current UK government delivered Brexit"

I saw the George Friedman 'rebuttal' to Kissinger. It's full of
generalities.. Countries that are... blah blah.. should not blah blah.

GF is good on collecting useful base info but has a problem delivering
the slam-dunk using them. That's why he goes off in wild tangents
predicting the next 10 years, 100 years so forth. One prediction was a
war between Asia Minor and Poland? How the hell will that happen (both
NATO countries BTW)?

---

Done well? Part of their country is *taken*. Over 6 million of the
country's citizens are now refugees. I dont think they are doing well.

All that is MSM concocted bullshit - delivered next to segments on
'moms making molotof cocktails in their kitchen' or 'regular people
learning to fight (just saw one such seg yesterday)'.

"But Ukraine has done well so far"

---

Ukraine is no NATO. NATO-trained yes

---

Not true. NATO would be a formiddable foe against Russia, or anyone
who is dumb enough to take them on. Minus nukes, they'd wipe the floor
with any other power. With nukes involved obviously everyone loses.

"NATO would lose against Russia"

---

Massive electronic-warfare utilization, can have incoming missiles go
haywire. Increased target acquisition capab for later artillery
bombardment.. Can't fight this shit through proxy. Just saying.

Business Insider: "[2/2022] At the tactical level, Russia's
non-contact warfare doctrine seeks to leverage drone spotters and
electronic warfare to locate enemy forces for destruction at standoff
distances using artillery without exposing tanks and infantry to
direct fire until the opposition is shattered"
