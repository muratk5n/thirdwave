US is also there.. There can be "base-off" before major action.

BTW there is a kung-fu base in Djibouti. Threat level unknown, but it
is at a chokepoint of sorts.

"@steveschale

14% of hospitalized Floridians are on a ventilator.

They use deep neural nets for this sort of stuff, but often simple
stupid logistic regression works well too (a very rudim stat
technique). The amt of LR use at Google would blow your mind.

How does it work? You feed gazillion images (in the same format)
against dementia diagnosis 'labels', train it, then for a new similar
input the system spits out a dementia diagnosis.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
