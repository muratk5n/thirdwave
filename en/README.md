Morocco has the world's largest Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant,
Ouarzazate Solar Power Station. It covers 3,000 hectares (the size of
3,500 football fields), and can be seen from space. It generates 580MW
of electricity, and will power 1 million homes and numerous cities"

Got some. And bro.. extremely potent. Tastes like condensed Guiness.

Fantastic history to all these things. Fine innovation.

Wiki: "The product that was to become Marmite was invented during the
late 19th century when German scientist Justus von Liebig discovered
that brewer's yeast could be concentrated, bottled and eaten...  By
1912, the discovery of vitamins was a boost for Marmite, as the spread
is a rich source of the vitamin B complex; with the vitamin B1
deficiency beriberi being common during World War I, the spread became
more popular. British troops during World War I were issued Marmite as
part of their rations"

It is 100% veg

I see.. this guy puts marmite in the veg patties.. Marm is an B12 bomb.

*Shang Chi*, same, little more SJW.. Too bad for MCu got the cold
shoulder from CCP, lost millions coulda had.. It was ok, but not sure
it can build towards something. The character is too marginal afaik.

---

*No Time to Die* was fine, Bond enough.. There was some SJW. Touching
at times. Good action, tech.

Centrism got its ass kicked in Virginia. Trump derangement, running
specifically against Trump didn't work. Not being able to hit the
opponent on Carlyle, like a leftist could, then getting mired in
culture war like a 90s centrist Clintonite destroyed the guy. And
I loved it.

---

Note that the first crisis in Clinton WH was a hot-button social
issue, not an economic issue. For econ they'd do NAFTA and everyone
was on board for that, except that one weird guy with the squeky
voice.. In a debate on the subject Perot (that weird guy with the
squeky voice) would argue against, Gore wld argue for, and one of the
"eminent characters" Gore would pull out of his bag to support his
case would be Powell -- he was apparently for NAFTA, and why wouldn't
he be? He was a Republican.

---

Let's not forget Colin Powell was beloved by Reps but not because he
was a good general but because he fought in the culture war and
"scored one on the libs"

Bipartisanship needs to get a demotion from being a remarkable event,
to something regular, and an unremarkable event. You agree on some
stuff, you get them done. What's the big deal..?
