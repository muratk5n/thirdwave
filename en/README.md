"Infantry takes big hit in British Army reorganisation.. Nearly 20% of
the British Army's infantry soldiers are to be lost as a result of the
Future Soldier reorganisation"

"Australia will send soldiers and police to the Solomon Islands in a
bid to help quell violent protests that have been linked to the
Pacific nation’s diplomatic switch from Taiwan to China"

In a general sense "productification", the "last-mile" of tech is
useful, but also only the tip of the iceberg. Opportunism is one
thing; ideas that benefit society is another.

Xerox did some good innovation as a private company, though the lab
was heavily, heavily funded by [gov](2021/10/entrepreneuel-state-mazzucato.md#corplabs).
But even this type of long-term, basic research fell out of favor at companies.
There are cases where the founder is a researcher himself, other than
that it is more of a hand-to-mouth existence now, whatever is "out there",
take it, throw it madly into a bowl hoping something comes out of
it. Take battery, put it in a car; hoping it doesn't blow up or catch
fire (which sadly, it does).

Apple [and MS] stole the desktop GUI idea from Xerox Parc BTW as
admitted to by [Bill Gates](2021/10/the-one-device-merchant.md#xerox).

Gladwell: "[Steve] Jobs’s sensibility was editorial, not

Automated agro company Iron Ox did away with artificial lights typical
vertical farm uses, they use sunlight instead.. In the right place
sunlight cld be cheap. But in that case cannot stack up layers bcz
upper shelves would block sunlight for the lower shelves..

Still, automated, sealed-off agro is very cool.
