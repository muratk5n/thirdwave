If this election was about selecting the most un-BJ person, that was
actually Truss. Sunak's attitude was more like BJ, energetic speaking,
a whatever it takes attitude..

---

Likely wont be a need to new PM can be more popular than BJ for
the mere fact she is not BJ.

---

Why did Tories under BJ went after working class votes? Some of that
is due to Brexit.. Brexit could only be sold to the working class
(they were duped obviously), the EU was an "elite thing" and once it
passed, Tories were now 'stuck' with their new constituency, different
than their usual.. With BJ as PM they could appeal to them due to his
personality, but that all put the pro-business conservatives in a
funk..

Hopefully the new PM will act more a con, and end this bizarre
charade. If you will lose as a con, lose as a con. Die on that hill.

H2 Central: "China takes aim at leadership in hydrogen fuel vehicle
industry..

The hydrogen fuel vehicle sector in China is starting to accelerate as
that country, already the largest H2 producer in the world, sees its
companies and local governments come together with new technology
advancements and supportive policies...

China is expected to have 50,000 H2-powered cars and trucks on its
roads by the close of 2025.

This prediction was issued in March by the National Development and
Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration in China"

Chilean contitution proposal rejected; thought leaders there probably
thought the prop was trying to bite more than it could chew. Chilean
existing consitution dates back to Pinochet era, I'm sure their left
see it as fascist, the political consensus however wasn't ready for
this change.

One of the key people who sold the Iraq War, R. Kaplan, regrets
it. One of the most visible 180 degree turns among the neo-cons there
is.. I appreciate the honesty.

Rep condemns divisiveness and refers to Abraham Lincoln again :) This
talking point just keeps on giving

To understand voters you need to squint, imagine there is fog and you
are looking through it... It's like the dog in the *Simpsons*. In one
episode they showed how the dog perceives the world; people would
talk, then they show his perception, the dog would hear "blah blah
blah blah", once in a while he'd hear something he wld understand like
"sit", then he sits. Otherwise it's just blah blah blah blah

---

JB net approval rose to -10%. Improvement. Laws passed, "stuff is
happening" so in the voter mind it could translate to "there is
forward momentum". Gasoline prices are falling, they can surely
understand "more money in my pocket".
