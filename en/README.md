It's tough to argue against coal, where it is available it is abundant as fuck

I checked a few, here is [Harrison](https://www.gem.wiki/Harrison_Power_Station#Emissions_Data)

In all these plants? Fort Martin Power Station, Grant Town Power
Plant, Harrison Power Station, John E. Amos Power Plant, Longview
Power Plant, Longview Power Plant, Morgantown Energy Facility,
Mountaineer Power Plant, Mount Storm Power Station, Pleasants Power
Station?

I dont think any of these plants have CCS.

West Virginia produces clean energy? Really?

Yes LCOE (total cost of electricity) will increase with CCS, over 70%
in all cases. Levelised cost of hydrogen is about 50% higher than the
average again from coal + CCS (my prefered scenario). Dunno what to
say, gov, policy needs to whip ppl into shape. Unless the cost of
those investments increase, the direction of tech will never change.

It is tough to argue against high power prices in the middle of a
winter of course when ppl are freezing their asses off, but offset
that price somehow, start somewhere. The good news is the tech exists,
has a specific price tag, which will only come down in the future.
As a all-around-shoot-the-shit blogger I can only talk about broad
directions. How they translate into the minutea of policy, reg is
the job of government.

Since 2019.. How about the very last spending? Do these plants have
CCS? Likely not.

Business Insider: "[A]fter more than a decade of keeping interest
rates near zero, the Federal Reserve is all but assured to raise them
multiple times in the coming year to fight inflation. In the world of
finance, these hikes are akin to messing with the Earth's
gravity. Assets that were once attractive — companies that used cheap
capital to grow rapidly without making a profit — will be
shunned. Some of the investors who ate up those growth stories will go
out of business.

Before the pandemic, the most pressing problem for central banks
around the world was the meandering recovery from the financial
crisis. Growth was sluggish, and inflation was well short of their
target, prompting the Fed and others to keep interest rates
historically low to encourage banks to give out loans and juice the
economy. A side effect of making money easy to borrow was that all
kinds of garbage ideas could get funding and all kinds of garbage
companies could stay in business. Combine that with lax corporate law
enforcement and you have Wall Street without consequences. Investors
were champing at the bit to pile into companies that used fantastical
metrics, like WeWork, and lapped up every utterance from billionaire
CEOs who promised flashy technology but consistently underdelivered,
like, say, Elon Musk.

And that was before millions of bored, homebound Americans jumped into
the market via Robinhood and other trading apps. Armed with their
pandemic-era stimulus checks, they bought crypto, piled into
blank-check companies called SPACs, and joined message boards claiming
that stocks like AMC and GameStop were going "to the moon." Awash with
capital, companies — especially in tech — saw their valuations leave
Earth's atmosphere and make a home somewhere on Saturn. Short sellers
were culled. Value investors went into hiding.

'We really did hit peak stupid, but peak stupid extended beyond truly,
truly stupid and then we went to
bottom-of-the-ocean-rare-earth-metal-companies stupid,' the value
investor told me.

This is the kind of bubble a financial professional should see forming
— one where investors lose sight of fundamentals like profitability
and cash flow and embrace a kind of Beanie Baby zeitgeist. In
fairness, on Wall Street you can make a lot of money dancing to the
music at a bubble party. Or you can stand by the snacks and
watch. What you cannot do is pretend that the music will never stop...

Investors Like Cathie Wood — perhaps the most starry-eyed of all the
investors betting on moonshot (at best) technology who've caught fire
during this bubble — will soon come to find that precious few are
interested in a stock that might quadruple in five years if it can't
show how it will generate the cash to fund its business until
then. Wood's Ark Innovation ETF made a truckload of money for
investors in 2020 until its peak in early February 2021 (yes, during
all the meme-stock insanity). But since then Woods' ETF has cratered,
losing about half its value from its peak to its current trough...

Hiking rates from their decade-plus doldrums is nothing short of
economic regime change. The stock market we had before isn't coming
back. It will take a year or two of the highs getting lower and the
lows never bottoming before it's all over. After that, we'll be living
in another world. In the meantime, get your bathing suits on and
prepare for the washout"

Things might get worse, which would make the war even more politically
damaging by then.

"Would it be beneficial for the US admin for a possible Ukrainian deal
(a loss) to happen after midterms?"

---

"Russia used vacuum bomb during invasion, Ukrainian ambassador claims"

This thing wont be won by Twitter put-downs, UKR President selfies, or
"looking brave". You could do all these things and still get your ass
kicked.

You dont have to like the other side's stance, but it they are
consistent, stance fits into a power structure, you can work with
that. After 9/11 US gov types were like 'these jihadi mfkers are f-ing
weirdos.. I miss the Cold War at least *the other side was
rational*'. Well here are the Russkies, they are back. Finlandization
was done for them. Can it be done again?

---

Take the deal

"The Ukrainian side emerged from the talks with little optimism, and
Russian President Vladimir Putin has shown no flexibility thus
far... Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron that Ukraine must
disarm, proclaim its neutrality, and recognize Crimea as Russian, per
state media"
