CNBC: "Amazon is the latest threat to Facebook as ad targeting
suffers.. Until a year ago, Amazon didn’t even disclose the size of
its advertising business, leaving analysts and investors to guess how
much the company was making in allowing sellers and brands to promote
their wares on the site and apps. Now, the company’s ad division is a
38 billion annual business, and last week reported 19% year-over-year
growth in the fourth quarter to $11.6 billion"

Chris Hedges: "Woke Imperialism.. The brutal murder of Tyre Nichols by
five Black Memphis, Tennessee, police officers should be enough to
implode the fantasy that identity politics and diversity will solve
the social, economic and political decay that besets the United
States. Not only are the former officers Black, but the city’s police
department is headed by Cerelyn Davis, a Black woman. None of this
helped Nichols, another victim of a modern-day police lynching.  ​

The militarists, corporatists, oligarchs, politicians, academics and
media conglomerates champion identity politics and diversity because
it does nothing to address the systemic injustices or the scourge of
permanent war that plague the U.S. It is an advertising gimmick, a
brand, used to mask mounting social inequality and imperial folly. It
busies liberals and the educated with a boutique activism, which is
not only ineffectual but exacerbates the divide between the privileged
and a working class in deep economic distress. The haves scold the
have-nots for their bad manners, racism, linguistic insensitivity and
garishness, while ignoring the root causes of their economic
distress. The oligarchs could not be happier...

If you stand with the oppressed, you will almost always end up being
treated like the oppressed. This is why the F.B.I., along with Chicago
police, murdered Fred Hampton and was almost certainly involved in the
murder of Malcolm X, who referred to impoverished urban neighborhoods
as 'internal colonies.'"

Paper: "[T]he high-temperature [solid-oxide direct-ammonia fuel-cell]
need a preheat treatment process before the fuel cell operation. It is
more suitable for the stationary energy system, instead of automotive
appli­ cations. Japan is a country intensively developing renewable
energy for its industrial and residential usage. Moreover the IHI, a
Japanese manufacturing firm, obtained 1-kW class power from a high
temperature DAFC, which could possibly replace those facilities using
natural gas in the future"
