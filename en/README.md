"My research results at this point thus indicate that we can expect a
halt in economic growth within the next two decades .. organizations
like the IMF have been pointing out recently that we're seeing a
'synchronized slowdown in global growth'"

It all started with "what was up with that seventh son of a seventh
son thing?", and down the rabbit hole we go on mysticism, snake
rituals, and *inciaramazione*.

Politico: "The yearslong effort by state and local governments in the
U.S. to force the pharmaceutical industry to help pay to fix a
nationwide opioid addiction and overdose crisis took a major step
forward Tuesday when lawyers for local governments announced they were
on the verge of a $26 billion settlement with the nationâ€™s three
biggest drug distribution companies and the drugmaker Johnson &
Johnson"

You are not bunch of punks from Central whatever.. nor from Crimea,
per culture. Everyone living in Asia Minor is closer to Homer
(of Illiad fame) than to Kubilay, Genghic.. whatever.

Lots of Tatars migrated into Anatolia BTW, estimated to be at
1,800,000 btw 1870-1900. I observed in gobble gobble their descendants
were more willing to embrace the tigger identity, bcz IMO not it
offered them "nomadicness" (they also had recently 'arrived', right?)
but also ethnically they cld claim a certain Asiaticness through
it. But Tatars arriving to TR were likely Russian in
nature.. Ops. Then they were assimilated into Anatolia which is not
Turkic either.. So either way, they are not tiggers. Rejoice.

Started to experiment with the ultiamte dish, one thing that u can
prepare everyday, tastes good enough, and has everything
needed. Currently on a mixture of onions, cheap chuck, green beans,
salt, lemon, olive oil -- all thrown together and cooked. Not bad.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
