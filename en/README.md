Not a big fan of these programs. IMO attacking the root with tech
(green molecules) will do more

My bearish plays: BABA, JD and NIO. I don’t care what their growth or
revenue is. China’s Communist Ruling Party is a scam, untrustworthy,
and ultimately will pillage all profits from any company. American
investors will never see a dime. My bull position: India"

"[I]f you follow the [GR] equations back in time, general relativity
eventually stops working. Therefore, no one presently knows how the
universe began. Indeed, we may never know. Since the days of Einstein,
physicists have made much progress detailing the history of the
universe. But the deeper they try to peer into our past, the more
difficult their task becomes...

The miserable status of today’s theories for the early universe makes
me wonder whether it has already happened. Cosmologists have hundreds
of theories, and many of those theories come in several variants. It’s
not quite as bad as in particle physics, but the situation is similar
in that cosmologists, too, produce loads of ill-motivated models for
no reason other than that they can get them published. (And they
insist this is good scientific practice. Don’t get me started.)..

The currently most popular theory for the early universe is called “inflation”...

Ever since the results of the Planck in 2013 it hasn’t looked good for inflation"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
