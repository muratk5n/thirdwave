H2 View: "A ‚Äúfirst-of-its-kind‚Äù facility in Israel capable of
producing 600MW of green hydrogen per year has started
development.. The.. systems will be based on a new patented technology
called Electrochemical ‚Äì Thermally Activated Chemical (E-TAC).. The
technology is a breakthrough for the hydrogen industry having a 95%
efficiency rate whilst also costing less than an electrolyser to
create.. Once operational, these systems will enable the production of
hydrogen at scale for a rate around $1/kg"

H2 View: "Green hydrogen capacity in Germany could reach 28GW in 8
years.. The DWV said that it is possible that the country will have
reached a maximum green hydrogen supply capacity of 16.25 GW per year
by 2025. Then, by 2030, that number will have exploded to 27.8GW. This
represents a¬†considerably higher achievement¬†than the goal the country
has set for itself"

H2 View: "Hypersonix Launch Systems has received a boost in the
development of its hydrogen-fuelled platform with the [Oz] Federal
Government providing $2.95m to support its development.

The project, titled ‚ÄòDART CMP Airframe ‚Äì a reusable hypersonic
platform‚Äô, is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that can travel at
hypersonic speeds up to Mach 12 (12 times the speed of sound) and is
powered by a SPARTAN hydrogen fuelled scramjet engine"

There's a relative flattening of the curve.. Oil is becoming harder
and harder to find? More offhore, and especially "deep offshore"
exploration might be proof that it is. That jels with Hubbard's thesis
who had made some good calls on US oil exploration leves before the
70s.

40 years give and take, taking population increase into
account. Things can work backwards of course, population can decrease
due to lower "carrying capacity".  It wld be a sad world tho if it is
still relying mostly on fossil by that time

World oil reserves from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/oil-proved-reserves?country=~OWID_WRL).
Looks like they are subtracting the extracted amount from an initial reserve estimate,
so the numbers are always the current level for each date , currently it stands at
1732 billion barrels of oil.

The world consumes 35 gboe per year. If no new oil was found current
reserves would last about 50 years.

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('oil-proved-reserves.csv')
df = df[df.Entity=='World'].set_index('Year')
df['Oil - Proved reserves'].plot()
print (df['Oil - Proved reserves'].tail(4))
```

:) There is no such thing as "Turk". Just like there are no Italians,
Irish, or "African-Americans" in US. People have bizarre ideas on
culture, nationhood, and their interactions thereof..

I guess these "Nazis" weren't such a big deal then, eh? üòâ

FT: "Russia no longer requesting Ukraine be ‚Äòdenazified‚Äô as part of ceasefire talks'

That's weak. A deep rabbit hole there.. Anything can be justified through this
reasoning.

"By using overwhelming force US helped both sides avoid casualties,
including Japanese. So in essence US ended up saving lives by targeting
civilians".

---

Harry Truman was a war criminal. Targeted and killed civilians right?

"They started it"? (With Pearl Harbor). US had sanctioned Japan
earlier - a form of attack. Then during Pearl Harbor Japan hit
military targets, not civilian. But later in the war US targeted
civilians through its nuke and firebombing campaigns.
