"JCB, developer of the world’s first working construction machines
powered by hydrogen, today unveiled another world first for the
industry - a mobile hydrogen refueller. JCB is investing £100 million
in a project to produce super-efficient hydrogen engines and has
already showcased working prototypes of a backhoe loader and Loadall
telescopic handler powered by hydrogen"

Deep neural nets are used in ad-hoc fashion, shove data from one end,
turn the crank, it spits out some stuff from the other end. Their
non-scientific nature made them a dead-end route for AGI. Any
theoretical connection to their use is a good thing.

TabPFN has a connection to theory, a positive development; they can
*prove* something, an approximation to Bayesian inference. In effect
TabPFN is almost an implementation of theory, as FVM can implement
CFD.

Problems in a Second.. TabPFN is radically different from previous ML
methods. It is a meta-learned algorithm and it provably approximates
Bayesian inference"

More on heritage and how little it matters. C. Rapaille is
off-the-boat French. Despite this 'heritage' his son is not. Excerpt
is from his book *The Culture Code*.

The new eLife approach can work... Every submitted paper is
automatically available (not 'rejected', or 'accepted'), publisher
assesment is still included with the published paper, others' comments
also visible, and the author can resubmit.

I'm thinking incentives.. prestigious publishers can still exist, to
the extent they can pull prestigious reviewers, the add-on they
provide will be those reviews. Readers would still be able to get a
feel of a up/down vote on the paper, but the paper is available either
way, available for others to see/comment.
