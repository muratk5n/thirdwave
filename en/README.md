Sotomayor agrees. [She said] 'If I had my way, I would make pro bono
service a requirement"

Privatization in law is probably one of the most harmful places for it
than anywhere else, being able to get "the best defense money can buy"
can tip the balance considerably. Then both sides are not equal under
the law. Nationalize the law firms! Either that, or introduce a
"forced pro bono" where lawyers from private firms must contribute a
portion of their time to the public for free.

I have [double](tweets/2011/double-facepalm.jpg),
[triple](tweets/2017/triple_facepalm.jpg),
[quadruple](tweets/2020/quadruple-facepalm.jpg), and
[quintuple](tweets/2020/quint-facepalm.jpg). I might have to do
a sextuple version soon.

MSNBC: "A deep dive by ProPublica identified at least 18 billionaires
and another 252 really-rich-but-not-quite-billionaires who got
stimulus checks under the CARES Act of 2020. They didnâ€™t cheat to get
it â€” it just so happens that lots of really rich donâ€™t actually
receive much of what the rest of us rely on as income. In the case of
each of the 18 billionaires, none took an income greater than $75,000,
which entitled them to taxpayer funded relief money"

science any time soon"

The Norwegian mathematician Abel he apparently had a tragic life, he
made many discoveries but in his lifetime, but they were not
recognized. Now he is a national icon in Norway, there is a huge
statue of him in Oslo: but the joke is, since noone knew what he
looked like, they made the statue so big that you cannot see his face
when you are near it. Arthur Mattuck shared this story during a lecture.

Non-farm payroll YoY increase was 4% for Nov. See [graph](2019/05/stats.md#nfp).

It was Johnson, Biden stole it. In an earlier Prez run the media
caught him plagiarizing a speech by Neil Kinnoc, they killed his
campaign for that, now he is doing it again, a poke in the eye. "See,
here I do it again, and I am President". The media seems to be unfazed
though.

"Who is the originator of the phrase Build Back Better, Boris Johnson or Biden?"
