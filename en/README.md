I prefer CSP but if political horse trading requires it, here's a way.

Paper: "One of the most promising options for generating power from
coal, whilst capturing at a minimum efficiency penalty CO2, is based
on gasification. Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants
can be built [.. with carbon capture rates] above 90%... More
importantly, gasification systems produce hydrogen as a fuel gas,
which can be purified and used in a low carbon economy where hydrogen
is foreseen to be a major energy carrier."

NH3/H2 pipeline is preferable to natgas (e.g. Nordstream 2), natgas
can leak methane.

Ammonia can be 'cracked' to extract H2. It can be combusted cleanly
for turbines (Japan demostrated how). There are even ammonia fuel-cell
engines. Ammonia can be stored, at room temparature, at massive
amounts. Since it has been used as feedstock for fertilizers for many
years, there is much expertise around handling it. Slam dunk.

```python
dens = 5.8 # kWh/kg
ammo = 1.2 * 1e9
print ('%d Megawatts' % (dens * ammo / (365*24*1e3)))
```

```text
794 Megawatts
```

A good amt of energy. Clean molecules for transport FTW.

H2 View: "Russian-German ammonia supply chain to support hydrogen
demands..  1.2 million tonnes of fuel [a year] is set to cover a
significant share of hydrogen demand in Germany... To ensure the
ammonia production is as environmentally friendly as possible, carbon
dioxide formed during the natural gas-to-hydrogen production process
will be captured and stored using a highly efficient underground
storage infrastructure (CCS)"

Does that Arctic Vault store the PDF of all books ever published?
Need that shit.

Not Even Wrong Blog: "Multiverse mania started seriously among string
theorists around 2003, with a defining event Susskind‚Äôs February 2003
The Anthropic Landscape of String Theory. At the time I was finishing
up writing what became the book ‚ÄúNot Even Wrong‚Äù.. For many years I
found it impossible to believe that this pseudo-scientific point of
view would get any traction.. It has become clear recently that we‚Äôve
now reached that end-point. From the new video of his discussion with
Rovelli, it‚Äôs clear that David Gross has given up. No more complaints
about the multiverse from him, and his vision of the future has string
theory solving QCD 80 years from now, nothing about it ever telling us
anything about where the Standard Model comes from"
