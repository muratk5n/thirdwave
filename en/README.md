The Atlantic: "Vaccination rates are high on mainland China, about 88
percent, but mRNA vaccines are not available. The German firm BioNTech
has been waiting months for approval to enter the Chinese
market.. China has not developed its own mRNA jab [.. uses]
Chinese-developed Sinopharm and Sinovac shots. These 'inactivated
virus' vaccines have proved to be less effective at stopping COVID
deaths"

the virus, clearing its name"

TDB: "When writer and filmmaker Rupert Russell sat down to write his
book *Price Wars*, which covers how price volatility is the root of
global chaos, he didn't expect Alan Greenspan, the longtime former
Federal Reserve chairman, to be a 'villain' in the story. But in this
bonus episode of The New Abnormal, Russell explains how a move by
Greenspan to deregulate the commodity markets in 1998 has caused
decades of market trouble"

Libertarianism is poisened in US.. A coopted version is used to
provide cover for billionaires while they push for pro-freedom-sounding
ideas, at the same time they generate culture war material to make
themselves useful among the equally corrupt, retarded right-wing
Republicans. All those merry band of cocksuckers around Peter Thiel do
nothing but that.. The German version of a libertarian will fight
an abortion rule created by *actual Nazis*, US faux-libertarians will
stand silent on the issue to weasel their way in to Rep circles then once
inside push for [anti-green agenda](2022/01/faux-contrarians-faux-liberterians.md).
These are some wretched cocksuckers.

Its good to try things.. Now ask it to summarize the text it generates
and let me know. I'm waiting by the phone.

Jets have incredibly high energy behind them, they can't be pushed
from bunch of random stuff swirling around a black hole. Cant have a
bullet firing out of a water swirl while it's going down the
drain.. Physically impossible.

How do jets escape black holes from which supposedly nothing can
escape, including light?

It's about picking the right pieces, which means the right-sized
pieces. Tiny particles are too numerous, plus never clearly defined /
definable.  They are not the right components to put together for
*greater sum*. But looking at macro measurable attributes, placing
those together in nonlinear ways (or transform them in ways so they
can be added linearly) is the right granularity and an approach that
work for us (humans).

"You said science is not about tiny particles, instead mathematical
relations, but in greater sum approach you say nonlinear combos can
have large effects"
