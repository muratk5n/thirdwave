H2 View: "A 500MW proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser plant
will in 2023 be operational in Foshan, Guangdong Province, China,
thanks to a new hydrogen-focused joint venture formed between Cummins
and China Petrochemical"

Want to invest in energy? Try US sunshine belt, CA, NV, UT, AZ, NM, CO
and invest in CSPs. Massive potential there.

Offshore driling rigs need to be banned.

Am all for coexisting with fossil fuel ppl, but some methods are too
dangerous.

Oil has been leaking there SINCE 2004 

Al Jazeera: "$475M settlement proposed in longest-running oil
spill.. Sixteen wells off Louisiana have been leaking since September
2004, when a subsea mudslide caused by Hurricane Ivan knocked over a
Taylor production platform"

The basis for the vax, the mRNA tech, was made possible thanks to
DARPA.  The final product was highly incentivized by massive subsidies
from US government. Yet many countries are still lacking vaccines
while pharma comps are raking it in.

---

The price is 30 times its production cost. What kind of business is this?
Is it a business?

The Guardian: "The Channel 4 investigation reveals analysis by one
biological engineering expert claiming the Pfizer vaccine costs just
[$1] to manufacture for each shot. It is reportedly being sold for [30
dollars] a dose to the UK government"

The Guardian: "Data from the UK and South Africa suggest Omicron
carries a reduced risk of hospitalisation and severe disease"

---

"The US government has approved the [sale] of aircraft launch and
recovery systems intended to equip France's next-generation aircraft
carrier"

---

What's wrong with string theorists asking for 80 more years? That's
like a young Einstein saying "ok let me work on special relativity for
40 years, until Im 60, then I'll pass the baton to someone else and he
will work on it until he is 60, then *maybe* that person will hit upon
the final theory". That is just insane.

Bizarre physics theories, shoddy green energy tech, crypto
miners.. Welcome to the future.

---

There are free compute services (usually to entice users for paid
services but still), many students researchers use them.

---

ABC AU: "At present, the most widely used estimate of the energy
required to "mine" Bitcoins is comparable to the electricity usage of
New Zealand, but this is probably an underestimate"

---

These people are like locust. 

"@choldgraf

Crypto miners are generating a ton of extra work for the operators of
http://mybinder.org. Does anybody know of a way to prevent this abuse
without requiring people to sign up for accounts?!..

It's extraordinary what negative secondary effects the crypto world
has had. Every public service that offers compute is getting abused,
generating ... stress for people that are trying to offer services for
the public"

It makes sense; at typical F1 speeds if the racecar had wings, it
would fly.  Designer is trying to do the opposite, to make the car
stay on the ground.

Aero as in aerodynamics. Hah.. 

Sergio Rinland, Formula 1 Racecar Designer: "The first priority is
aero, the second priority is aero, the third priority is
aero, the fourth priority is tires...".

AFP: "The tight US labor market has not spared the trucking industry,
where "help wanted" pleas are plentiful, wages are on the rise, and
drivers recently have scored signing bonuses of up to $20,000"

"US Navy seizes thousands of guns bound for Yemenâ€™s Houthis.. The US

Iran"

Danube is quite big. 1.5 km wide, second largest river in Europe.

There is a shipping [route](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHT1ThKXMAQfYdU?format=png&name=small)
through the Suez-Bhosphorus-Danube and since it is now linked up
with Rhine in 1992, all the way to Rotterdam.

But "some countries" are planning an alternative through [Greece-Serbia](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FHT0659XsAY1E3C?format=jpg&name=small)
to bypass Stanpoli altogether. Tsck tsck tsck.. Dont be dissing my homie now..

Connections.. connections.. It's what I do

New items added to [timeline](2017/12/timeline-syria-tr.md). See 2010.
