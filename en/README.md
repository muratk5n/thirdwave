The friend, Ben.. I was wondering where that actor had gone.. Saw the
guy on *Battleship* (good mov), one X-Men, *John Carter* (WTF?), then
nothing. Good actor.

*The Terminal List* - going great so far.. Fine action, story.

Centrist Democrats started this whole mess by inflaming culture wars,
then not being able to fight it, were hammered, the current SCOTUS is
the result of that. But the starting of that fight could have been a
sign of desperation itself, pols could find a working political setup
at the federal level, so they resorted to these secondary measures,
issues (and some are pummeled by them, and now the whole country looks
like a f-ing joke, the place who fought for slavery cannot guarantee
basic freedoms to women). If you cant handle the federal level, then
well, maybe you don't have a federal level.

---

One could argue United States became united without proper discussion,
without proper debate, in a modern context. There was the civil war
around slavery, federal/local divide was always an issue, but division
settled.. too soon..? Post WWII the war-state bulldozed over
everything anyway and took over, without much discussion.

Europe is going through that discussion now, how states work together,
while still being distinctly seperate, we see some states join (and
some leave).  Stuff is being worked on... Maybe US needs to go back to
a clean slate, then start over. Be less united, then try again.

---

What to do about the "dumb tinkering" approach commonly seen in US?
Maybe bcz of latest SCOTUS actions against the "administrative state",
will have the side effect of US eventually disintegrating. Then there
won't be any experiementation of any kind at gov level, bcz nothing
will get done at that level.

I say this about El Salvador's Bukake; his country does not show up in
my drug trafficking map, so tough on drugs stance must be working. He
doesn't know much about economics, but not bad here.

Politico: "After decades of illegally crushing competition at the
expense of consumers and small businesses, .. "Big Tech".. are finally
facing their antitrust comeuppance in Washington.. American Innovation
and Choice Online Act (AICO).. would ban Big Tech companies from
unfairly giving their products a boost over competitors. The prospect
of this widely popular bill passing has led Big Tech to engage in one
of the most desperate lobbying sprees in recent history. Big Tech’s
“see-what-sticks” smear campaign against antitrust has encompassed
everything from false claims about content moderation to urging
consultants to pushing the message.. that AICO 'will harm communities
of color'"

The Atlantic: "In May, the Tribune was acquired by Alden Global
Capital, a secretive hedge fund that has quickly, and with remarkable
ease, become one of the largest newspaper operators in the
country. The new owners did not fly to Chicago to address the staff,
nor did they bother with paeans to the vital civic role of
journalism. Instead, they gutted the place...

The hollowing-out of the Chicago Tribune was noted in the national
press, of course. There were sober op-eds and lamentations on Twitter
and expressions of disappointment by professors of journalism. But
outside the industry, few seemed to notice. Meanwhile, the Tribune’s
remaining staff, which had been spread thin even before Alden came
along, struggled to perform the newspaper’s most basic
functions. After a powerful Illinois state legislator resigned amid
bribery allegations, the paper didn’t have a reporter in Springfield
to follow the resulting scandal. And when Chicago suffered a brutal
summer crime wave, the paper had no one on the night shift to listen
to the police scanner"

Yeah? One for all, all for one type of deal? A Mini Medi-NATO? That is
significant. FR has some strat interest in Eastern Med for sure.

"[9/2021] Under the conditions of the agreement signed by [Greece and
France], France has pledged to provide immediate military assistance
to Greece – and vice versa – in the event of an attack by a third
country, even if that country is in one of their alliances (such as
Turkey, which is a NATO member)"

BBC: "Russia moves to take control of Sakhalin-2 oil and gas project..
The project, which supplies about 4% of the world's current liquefied
natural gas (LNG) market, is 50% owned and operated by Gazprom..  This
appears to be a deeply political move. The impact is likely to be felt
most keenly in Japan, which has been heavily involved in sanctions
against Russia... Japan.. is heavily reliant on imports of liquid
natural gas. Competition for shipments globally is currently intense -
and the Sakhalin project alone currently meets about 8% of its needs"
