A MOON-LANDING MOMENT 

Microsoft: "Hydrogen fuel cells could provide emission free backup
power at datacenters.. A round of applause and shouts of joy from
engineers at Plug, who built the fuel cell system... The moment was
the latest milestone on Microsoft‚Äôs quest to find a zero-carbon
emissions replacement for the backup diesel-powered generators that
support continuous operations in the event of power outages and other
service disruptions.

'What we just witnessed was, for the datacenter industry, a moon
landing moment,‚Äù said Sean James, Microsoft‚Äôs director of datacenter
research. ‚ÄúWe have a generator that produces no emissions. It‚Äôs
mind-blowing.'"

Manchin FTW. Give credit where it's due.

Recharge: "US green hydrogen would become world's cheapest form of H2
under tax-credit plan in new Manchin-approved bill.. Producers would
receive up to $3 per kg ‚Äî depending on level of lifecycle greenhouse
gas emissions and staff wages ‚Äî if Inflation Reduction Act clears
Congress

The surprise breakthrough tax and climate bill agreed yesterday by
maverick coal-state Democratic senator Joe Manchin and Senate majority
leader Chuck Schumer includes generous tax credits that would make
green hydrogen cheaper to produce than grey in many parts of the US"

H2 Central: "GTT has been granted two Approvals in Principle (AIP1 )
from the leading classification society DNV for the design of a
membrane type containment system for liquefied hydrogen (LH2) and for
the preliminary concept design of a LH2 carrier.

These approvals are part of the agreement with Shell, announced in
February 2022, and pave the way for the next stages of the project"

"The maximum hydrogen yield was 122 mL/g at 700 W..  the thermal
reduction process took only 4 min"

Microwave oven based thermochemical water splitting paper says "at 700
W, a temperature of 600 Celcius could be reached.. At this power, the
highest oxygen and hydrogen yields were [obtained]". 700 W is not a
crazy number.

Add to that the limited reserves of lithium the problem with battery
electric approach becomes clearer. This approach was nothing but a fad
triggered by few foolish administrations, faux genius jackoff CEOs,
and deluded white-collar cuck media.

"@GregKable

We need to be talking about this

- Atacama salt flat (Chile) claimed to hold 27% of global lithium reserves

- IER report: 2.27 million litres of water required to extract 1 ton of lithium

- average annual rainfall: 2mm

- Atacama water table losing 1950 liters/second"

Big claim - great if true

"ThorCon generates reliable electric power cheaper than coal,
competitive with natural gas, cheaper than LNG, cheaper than
storage-buffered wind and solar"

"ThorCon is a molten salt fission reactor. Unlike all current nuclear
reactors, the fuel is in liquid form. It can be moved around with a
pump, and passively drained in the event of a casualty.ThorCon‚Äôs
reactor operates at about the same pressure as your garden
hose. Standard nuclear reactors operate at up to 160 bar (2300
psi). They require 9 inch thick pressure vessels and massive piping..
The pump takes liquid fuelsalt ‚Äî a mixture of sodium, beryllium,
uranium and thorium fluorides"

Not directly addressing UKR-RU issue here.. Theirs is a
multidimensional beef. But UKR arming itself before the war surely
bothered Russia.

Do that, fine of course, as long as one can deliver the ass-kicking
that goes along with it, but the reverse is happening.

Customer churn analysis has these type of problems..  Tough to pin
down what churn is. Two months of non-activity considered churn? Maybe
the guy will be back after 65th day..? Maybe he was on
vacation. Survival Analysis, a related field. One approach I saw
formulates the reverse, try to predict how long 'not churn' will
last. Then can ask the model for a probability of certain 'not churn'
period ahead, apply cutoff, threshold on that.

---

How to prove that from data..? Data would have armament levels of both
sides over the years, plus whether they fought a war.. But how about
armaments which did *not* result in war..?

'Not war' is hard to pick from the data. If left out will introduce
(survivorship) bias. We see in data what we *can* see, not what is
actully happening.

"There is something called the security dilemma one side arming can
cause another to arm, we can prove it"
