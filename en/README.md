Seperate vid talks about problems with long-distance electricity
transmission, and the ill-fated DESERTEC plan. All of the issues
raised there are moot for H2 pipelines which can transmit ten times
more energy at one eighth the cost compared to the grid.

NH3 is still useful as energy vector, it can be combusted in a turbine
(Japan Mitsubishi has the tech), used for carrier for other kinds of
fuel-cells.

---

That must be why ammonia company GenCell tout alkaline fuel-cells, the
tech works even with non high-purity H2, as opposed to PEM which needs
high-purity.

Looking at the PE presentation again; they are especially focused on
compression, bcz apparently getting high-purity H2 is easiest that
way. Ammonia can carry huge amounts of H2, but getting high purity is
tough. From pg 10,

- Compression is integral to all three supply chains to increase the
volumetric energy density of H2

- Compression has minimal technical barriers..

- LH2 [liquid form] supply chain is significantly more complex with
additional energy intensive processes as well as onshore storage
requirements

- NH3 involves mature and well-developed technologies. However, if the
end user requires high purity hydrogen, then technical barriers and
energy penalty to crack and purify (reconversion)

BTW the heating energy calc [here](2022/01/heating-calculation-fourier.html) actually
takes energy used for cooling into account, indirectly; It calculates
the energy needed to raise (the average world temperature) from 13
to (room temperature) 22. Well, there are many temp levels
during the year that contribute to  that average. Sometimes it is -20,
sometimes 10, or 30. So by calculating 13->22 switch, we are
also calculating 40 to 22, for some places.

The Guardian: "But air conditioning and refrigeration are doubly
polluting: not only are they produced from climate-warming fossil
fuels, but the HFCs and other refrigerants cooling systems use produce
greenhouse gases that can be 4,000 times more potent than carbon
dioxide"

It isn't, bcz there is a clear beginning of the snowball. With the
chicken-and-egg "connondrum" as well there is a beginning; There was
something like a chicken which laid something that looked like an egg,
that started the process. Gov policy gives the push, starts the
snowball, more eggs.

"The demand-supply-more demand you described sounds like a
chicken-and-egg process / problem"

Walmart, Target stocks were hit especially bad maybe bcz if during

would be safe-havens for that kind of buy, when they missed their
earnings, value seekers were shocked. Nosedive.
