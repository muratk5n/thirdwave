"Matt Gaetz Leads 11 Lawmakers in Introduction of 'Ukraine Fatigue'
Resolution to Halt U.S. Aid to Ukraine.. 'Biden must have forgotten
his prediction from March 2022, suggesting that arming Ukraine with
military equipment will escalate the conflict to ‘World War III.’
America is in a state of managed decline, and it will exacerbate if we
continue to hemorrhage taxpayer dollars toward a foreign war. We must
suspend all foreign aid for the War in Ukraine and demand that all
combatants in this conflict reach a peace agreement immediately,'
Congressman Gaetz said"

If I had to pick one clean tech product to focus on personally, it
would be an ammonia fuel-cell for home/personal use (low temperature
version). Purchase fuel from existing ammonia infrastructure, then use
it to power home and other applications. Once NH3 itself is clean,
"well-to-wheel" becomes clean.

I bet these guys later went to Anatolia as well; they must have
brought yoghurt (a milk product) with them. No wonder Herodotus knew
about it in 800 BC.

IMO pastoralists represent a third kind of human organization - other
two are forager, farmer, this is the third way, they did domesticate
animals but do not stay in one place as the static farmer giving them
an advantage. Their main archetype would be the shephard. I see them
closer to foragers than farmers.

Steppe Migration Map - pastoralists came from Yamnaya

Farmers from A. Minor migrated to Europe, later 4800 BC pastoralist
steppe people migrated there. Farmers got wiped out by plague, they
were kinda unhealthy too much grain (lactose intol too, could not
handle milk, cheese). Their death eased steppe migration, pastoralists
attacked them too. In some ways Europeans (esp males) are Russians.

Steppers were pastoralists, had 'free-range' cattle moved a lot, lived
on milk and meat, not grain. Healthier, were physically more fit,
taller on average.
