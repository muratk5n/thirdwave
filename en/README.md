All the more reason to switch to contained, sealed-off, automated

A child could deduce the Sun is liquidic. We know the Sun's
gravitational pull on the Earth, from that, and known Earth mass, we
get Sun's mass. Sun's volume is easy, even optically we can determine
a rough radius, from there get volume. Divide mass with volume you get
density. That density my friend will be close to water's density. Good
old H2O -- a liquid.

Either do Finland, or at least flip classes around centrally recorded
/ chosen lectures.. For a slam dunk, follow my system.

"@IpseDixitCicero

In Finland private schools are illegal. The rich donate so their child
and ALL children have better schools.  Every child has equal
access. And, even better, Murdoch and his media are banned from
entering the country. It can be done and I wish we would"
