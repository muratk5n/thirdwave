These are all fantastic projects

H2 View: "The US Department of Energy (DOE) hasÂ announced the winners
of the first phase of the H-Prize..

- BoMax Hydrogen (Sanford, FL)Â a system that integrates light-activated
nanoparticles with an enzyme to produce clean hydrogen from sunlight

- Gold Hydrogen Team (Houston, TX)Â a process using dark fermentation to
biologically produce hydrogen in spent oil wellsÂ 

- Electro-Active Hydrogen (Knoxville, TN)Â a system that integrates solar
energy with algal hydrothermal liquefaction and microbial electrolysis
to generate clean hydrogen, leveraging the chemical energy from
organic matter

- Evolve Hydrogen Inc. (East Northport, NY)Â a novel electrolyser system
design that can use seawater as a feedstock without the need for
precious metal materials

- H3 (Palo Alto, CA)Â a system that integrates high-temperature solid
oxide electrolyzers with thermal energy storage to enable continuous
hydrogen production even when using intermittent renewable resources

- Biomass Super Gasifier (Indianapolis, IN)Â an indirectly-heated
pyrolytic gasification process to convert carbon-based feedstocks into
syngas from which hydrogen can be extractedâ€”with the remaining syngas
used in a solid oxide fuel cell to generate power to run the system

- NX Fuels Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI)Â a technology that harnesses sunlight to
produce hydrogen from seawater using a photoelectrochemical process

- PAX H2(O) (Richmond, CA)Â a technology that could reduce the capital
and operating expenses of an electrolysis system by producing clean
water using waste heat from the electrolyser

- The Hope Group (Lubbock, TX)Â in-situ microwave-assisted catalytic
heating to crack methaneÂ­Â and generate hydrogen directly from depleted
natural gas reservoirs"

Finfluencers are "financial influencers [who are] unlicensed
individuals giving people on social media financial
advice".. Licensing aside crypto has inherently weak internal
protection and random jagoff on social med giving advice on it
compounds the problem.

"Finfluencers"

BTW I hear lots of complaints about *Rings of Power* of AMZN, wont
watch it, heads up

I'm looking at [WaPo GH](https://github.com/washingtonpost), I see
`data-police-shootings`, I used its data before, good, but no war
related data? There is `data-game-of-thrones-deaths` ðŸ¤¨ Who gives a
shit about that? 21st century journalism is not just about 3 "being
online" - it should be about doing stuff that can only be done online,
disseminating curated raw data as well as regular news items.

RU/UA frontline is just a list of geo points; someone at MSM can
curate the data, and publish it as CSV file on a Github repo.

This is what Cummins does for their day job, building engine for a
TANK. The fact that these guys going all in for clean fuels should say
something.

Some laugh now, won't be laughing in a few months

The outline of deal are obvious.. the annexed areas are accepted as
RU, in return for RU not taking more areas, and not landlocking UA.

Last chance.. Make a deal. I believe things are abt to get much worse

Tech goes to clean fuel direct. Sunlight to H2. This aspect of H2
production was always the most compelling, as in game-changing sense;
since the final target is such a basic element, there are many
pathways to it, and lo and behold, we can go from heat to H2, or (yet
under-explored) from biological processes to H2, or sunshine to H2, as
well as already established methods..

Fantastic. Now deploy. En MASSE. Produce at scale.

"SunHydrogen.. the developer of a breakthrough technology to produce
renewable hydrogen using sunlight and water, today announced that it
has received the India Patent Officeâ€™s decision to grant its patent
'Multi-junction artificial photosynthetic cell with enhanced
photovoltages.'"

I like the prop. Uber, Lyft might lose profits, but they can adapt to
a new environment.

NYT: "The Labor Department.. unveiled a proposal that would make it
more likely for millions of janitors, home-care and construction
workers and gig drivers to be classified as employees rather than
independent contractors.

Companies are required to provide certain benefits and protections to
employees but not to contractors, such as paying a minimum wage,
overtime, a portion of a workerâ€™s Social Security taxes and
contributions to unemployment insurance.
	      
The proposed rule is essentially a test that the Labor Department will
apply to determine whether workers are contractors or employees for
companies. The test considers factors such as how much control workers
have over how they do their jobs and how much opportunity they have to
increase their earnings by doing things like offering new
services. Workers who have little of either are often considered
employees"

CNBC: "Uber, Lyft shares sink after Labor Department issues proposal
on gig workers"

A good thing.. US had an hand there - acknowledging that.  Now fix
Ukraine.
