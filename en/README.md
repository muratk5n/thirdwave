H2 Central: "Refueling milestone to bring fuel cell hydrogen trucks
closer to reality. Federal researchers hope in July to reach a key
milestone to refuel heavy-duty fuel-cell hydrogen trucks in 10
minutes, paving the way to prototype hardware and protocols for
fueling stations...

Shaun Onorato, project lead at.. [NREL] hydrogen infrastructure
program for heavy trucks, described.. steps being taken at the
U.S. Department of Energy to make this cutting-edge technology evolve
from the drawing board into a reality...

'I kind of equate it to when the automobile first came out, people
were trying to figure out how to fuel cars and with what rates and
components. It‚Äôs really neat to be on that side of things where this
is just completely brand-new territory.'

He has been working with NREL‚Äôs heavy-duty hydrogen fueling station ‚Äî
the world‚Äôs first ‚Äî that was created to be highly configurable to
enable a greater variety of research tests.

'Currently nothing exists in this realm for this type of fueling. NASA
does things like extremely high-mass transfer rates of liquid
hydrogen, but this is completely new territory for the fuel-cell
electric truck market,' he noted, adding that hydrogen-fueled trucks
in operation are for light duty and use that type of refueling
hardware.

'Some manufacturers use one nozzle or two to fuel the
trucks. Everything is based now on light-duty. This work will enable
the creation of a whole new set of components and protocols,' Onorato
said"

H2 Central: "Researchers at The Hong Kong University of Science and
Technology (HKUST) have developed a new hydrogen fuel cell which is
not only the world‚Äôs most durable1 to date, but is also more
cost-effective..  [R]esearch team led by Prof.. Minhua.. found a new
formula which not only could cut down the proportion of platinum used
by 80 percent, but also set a record in terms of the cell‚Äôs durability
level"

It can also mean not using crpto mining; digital currency tech is not

Not every country can do what Finland does. The world needs a scalable
method that can be copied to many environments at ease. Industrial
production scales one product design to many. Ed is still resisting
such "economies of scale" benefits by insisting in-person delivery of
content.

"But Finland finds good teachers"

---

Flipping the classroom is efficient, works better than
stand-up-and-deliver style teaching. It can also lessen the burden
on the number of teachers required. 

The Mandarin: "Could more online learning help fix Australia‚Äôs teacher
shortage? One option to free up teacher time and ensure students are
getting the education they need is some learning done online and some
face-to-face"

NYT: "Now Russian forces and their separatist allies control about 80
to 90 percent of the Donbas, according to Ukrainian officials.To take
complete control of Luhansk, Russia first devoted its full force at
the city of Sievierodonetsk, just across the river from
Lysychansk. After battering that city and eventually seizing control
on June 24, Russian forces set their sights on neighboring
Lysychansk.The twin cities were the last major population centers in
Luhansk Province under Ukrainian control. Now with both in hand,
Russia effectively controls all of the resource-rich region and can
regroup ? with Donetsk in its cross hairs.Controlling Sievierodonetsk
and Lysychansk means Russia could position its forces to mount
offensives on cities to the southwest, notably Sloviansk, Kramatorsk
and Bakhmut.Kramatorsk is one of the last major cities still under
Ukrainian control in Donetsk. If Kramatorsk falls, Mr. Putin?s forces
will in effect control the whole Donbas region"
