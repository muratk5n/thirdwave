H2 Central: "Air Liquide to build two new hydrogen production units
with carbon capture technology in Shanghai Chemical Industry
Park. Shanghai Chemical Industry Park Industrial Gases Co., Ltd
(SCIPIG), a subsidiary of Air Liquide, will invest more than 200
million euros to build two hydrogen production units and related
infrastructure in Shanghai Chemical Industry Park (SCIP).

These units will bring significant environmental benefits, as they are
designed to replace current supply from a third party coal-based
gasification unit, will be equipped with CO2 capture and recycle
technology and will be connected to SCIPIG existing local network"

Linde Engineering: "Transformational technologies to accelerate the
transition to a low-carbon economy by pipelining hydrogen to the point
of use Hydrogen holds great promise for the worldâ€™s decarbonization
journey. But the point of production rarely corresponds to the point
of use. Now, at the worldâ€™s first real-scale pilot plant in Dormagen,
Germany, Linde is providing proof-of-concept for a market-ready
transformational technology that connects the two. The plant combines
Lindeâ€™s HISELECTÂ® powered by Evonik membranes with pressure swing
adsorption technology to extract hydrogen from natural gas pipeline
blends â€“ so hydrogen can be tapped as needed"

And, hell, maybe the engineering will pick up so fast we'll get 60
mega CSP installations on the Sahara with a combined output of 60 GW
that will generate green fuels, it will be shipped, piped all over the
world.

IMO one has to try harder to make the case for green H2, but I will
anyway; even though its capacity might not reach blue levels, it will
incentivize clean fuel transition.

There is a place for the thriftiness in the pol spectrum, it
contributes to the average. I'm not interested in the spectrum which
actually indicates failure of analysis. The aim for analysis should be
to pinpoint the optimality before it is reached.

---

When govs decided to protect employment the direct result of that
would be inflation. No escape from that. The spend-thrift guy has no
extra analysis, he keeps repeating the same thing over and over.

---

Govs around the world wanted to protect businesses, through payment protection
schemes, encouraging them to keep employees. So many people stayed at home
getting payments, building up savings. After opening up those savings
became excess demand which helped a rise in inflation. Since many countries
(especially in the West) followed similar schemes, global inflation was
pushed up. Then there was the supply disruptions. 

---

People's savings during covid increased, much more than the cash payments
