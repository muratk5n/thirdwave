Chef uses nutritional yeast to make veg burger taste more like meat
burgers.  It's true, nut yeast has a certain kick (in taste) that cld
help.. Mushrooms too. 

Bean and rice for 9 aminos.. Experimenting continues. Not ditching
anim proteins completely just yet.

That Yosemite plant output isn't bad.. H2 energy density is 33.6
kWh/kg, 12,200 kg generation per day, and with 30 kwh usage assumption
per day, per home

```python
eng = 33.6*12200
"%d kwh per day" % eng
"enough energy for %d homes" % (eng / 30)
```

```text
Out[1]: 'enough energy for 13664 homes'
```

That is enough energy for a largish LA neighborhood BTW.. Silver Lake,
Los Feliz, Koreatown. Or Encino, East Holywood..  A single
plant. Generating energy from waste.

"Yosemite Clean Energy wants to produce 12,200 kg of green hydrogen
daily...the plant will utilise proven gasification technology to
sustainably covert waste woody biomass into syngas, from which
hydrogen and RNG is produced.

Through the deployment of such technology, Yosemite will make good use
of Californiaâ€™s estimated 35-million-tonnes of annual waste woody
biomass which is left to burn, decay, and decompose, emitting
greenhouse gases and black carbon"

"Kazakhstanâ€™s hydrogen and ammonia markets are set to be boosted by a
new partnership between KazMunayGas and Linde... a feasibility study
will be carried out to evaluate both using natural gas as a feedstock,
to create blue hydrogen and blue ammonia, and water electrolysis
technologies to create green hydrogen and green ammonia"

Al Monitor: "The US flew a nuclear-capable B-1B bomber over major
waterways of the Middle East [as a] show of force amid tensions.. with
Iran. Aircraft from US partners Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain and
Israel joined the bomber at various stages of the flight, which
included a pass over the Strait of Hormuz..  The B-1 also reportedly
flew over the Red Sea, Suez Canal and the Bab al-Mandeb.

The bomber took off from the US airbase on Diego Garcia, a remote
island in the Indian Ocean that is likely to become increasingly
important as Washington seeks to further shift the weight of its
military presence from the Middle East to Asia and the Pacific.

An undisclosed number of B-1Bs deployed to Diego Garcia last month to
bolster US bomber task force missions in the Pacific"
