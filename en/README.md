Paper: "Cost of long-distance energy transmission by different
carriers.. This paper compares the relative cost of long-distance,
large-scale energy transmission by electricity, gaseous, and liquid..
carriers. The results indicate that the cost of electrical
transmission per delivered MWh can be up to eight times higher than
for hydrogen pipelines"

He referenced the paper above

"@BrianGitt

Capital cost of long-distance energy transmission ($/mile-MW):

Electrical lines = $1,502

Hydrogen pipeline = $166

Natural gas pipeline  = $97

Oil pipeline = $16"

Ammonia Energy: "Mitsui & Co. and CF Industries will jointly develop a
greenfield facility that will produce CCS ammonia on the US Gulf
Coast. The partners are targeting a reduction of at least 60%
emissions compared to conventional ammonia production, with the
selection of a technology provider in its final stages..

[CF said:] 'Our work with Mitsui has reinforced our shared belief that
blue ammonia will play a critical role in accelerating the world’s
transition to clean energy and that demand for blue ammonia will grow
meaningfully in the second half of this decade. We believe that the
United States offers considerable advantages for blue ammonia
production due to access to plentiful and low-cost natural gas, the
regulatory and legal framework in place, and the geology suitable for
permanent carbon sequestration.'

In November last year we reported that, thanks to planned upgrades at
their existing Donaldsonville and Yazoo City plants, CF Industries was
targeting CCS ammonia production of 1.25 million tonnes per year from
2024"

[General Authority for Suez Canal Economic Zone] Signs MOU with Indian
Renew Power for 220,000 Tons of Green Hydrogen Production – $8B
Investment... 'The site initially will be set on an area of ​​600,000
square meters in the Sokhna integrated Zone, bringing the production
capacity of the two phases of green hydrogen to 220,000 tons and 1,100
million tons of green ammonia.' [SCZONE chairman] Zaki added"

H2 Central: "Hydrogen turbines – GE Gas Power awarded $4,2M in funding
from ARPA-E.. [The] funding is focused on two projects entitled
'Lifted-flame combustion for high-hydrogen reheat gas turbines' and
'Manufacturing high-yield investment castings with minimal energy.'
Both initiatives will be led by GE Gas Power and conducted at GE’s
Global Technology Center in Greenville, South Carolina... As part of
these projects, GE will conduct cutting-edge research for gas turbine
decarbonization"

OCI is a Netherlands based chemical company.. NL is becoming huge in
H2 energy and regulation would be strict.. The ammonia is certainly
clean. My only worry is not being able to generate clean fuels fast
enough, but in terms of tech, there is a pathway to a clean energy
future through both green and blue H2/NH3.

First shipment from this venture arrived to Japan recently 

"[06/2021: A] joint venture between Adnoc and OCI, will join the
development of a large blue ammonia plant in the UAE’s downstream
centre in Ruwais... The blue aspect refers to hydrogen derived from
natural gas feedstocks. The plant will have a production capacity of
1,000 kilotonnes a year"

The "Mandela Effect"? Most think Mandela died in prison instead of in 2013.
That is an "effect".. I think it's just people being dumb (or
uninformed). It's fine, really.. Does the man on the street need to
know everything? No. That's why we have professions.

If China consumes a lot of dirty coal, and the entire world depends on
them to produce stuff, then to lower emissions maybe countries should
not depend on China for so many products. Should the the environmental
footprint of a country define which tariffs get applied to it?

The Danish Strait - dam. It's busy up there..

Malacca is *closer* to the optimal path I bet corps shaving off cents

Is "the Malacca Strait worry" overblown? There are alternatives..
Sunda and Lombok Strait are both available and actually spacier for
ship traffic.

Pretty much noone in he region agree on maritime borders - and of course,
there is oil and gas involved.
