The Intercept: "By 2013, the Obama administration had concluded that
it could not charge WikiLeaks or Julian Assange with crimes related to
publishing classified documents — documents that showed, among other
things, evidence of U.S. war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan — without
criminalizing investigative journalism itself. [.. DOJ] called this
the “New York Times problem,” because if WikiLeaks and Assange were
criminals for publishing classified information, the New York Times
would be just as guilty.

Five years later, in 2018, the Trump administration indicted Assange
anyway. But, rather than charging him with espionage for publishing
classified information, they charged him with conspiracy to commit a
computer crime..

The alleged hacking not only didn’t happen, according to expert
testimony, but it also couldn’t have happened"

The map shared [before](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FCtre5sWEAgFFp9?format=png&name=small)
says sunlight radiation at maximum is ~300 W/m2. The number
used here until now was from Wikipedia, ~1000 W/m2,
sun at its zenith, an ideal situation. For daily calculations you
factor in sun availability, less direct sunlight, etc, you can
probably arrive at the numbers seen in that map. For more
accurate, region specific calculations that need a simple, daily
number, I'd go with that map.
