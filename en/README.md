"The world’s biggest port for coal exports could be home to one of
Australia’s next hydrogen hubs as the nation transitions to cleaner
energy.

The federal government has earmarked the Port of Newcastle for $3
million feasibility study to determine where a new 40 MW hydrogen hub
could be located at the port, on the New South Wales coast"

Is working with discontinuities the next level shit on many compsci
branches?  In optimization, subgradient methods rule. For waves
so-called Riemann approaches are extremely useful. Computation
discretizes anyway, so planning for splitting prob into chunks from
get-go can be a good idea.

When the dad in an action movie is Stephen Lang, or J. K. Simmons, you
know that's an action dad. You know near the end of the movie he is
getting a shotgun and there will be a shoot-out. There's just no other
reason for that casting otherwise.

I nudge the recommender now, giving it only one movie like to get more
movies of that type. WR came from *Vertical Limit*; makes sense, shot
in a wide landscape, lots of nature, snow..

*Wind River*, good
