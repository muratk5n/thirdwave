The European Union is one step closer to securing the annual supply of
two million tonnes of green hydrogen produced using electricity from
wind farms and solar power plants in the steppes of Kazakhstan. The
volume is equivalent to one fifth of European imports planned for
2030.

Hyrasia One, a subsidiary of Swedish-German company Svevind Energy
Group, reached an investment agreement in Astana with the Kazakh
government for the massive project.

New Evidence Against Dark Matter \#hossenfelder

More science fail 

Kroupa: "Dark Matter Doesn't Exist.. The current cosmological model
only works by postulating the existence of dark matter – a substance
that has never been detected, but that is supposed to constitute
approximately 25% of all the universe. But a simple test suggests that
dark matter does not in fact exist. If it did, we would expect lighter
galaxies orbiting heavier ones to be slowed down by dark matter
particles, but we detect no such slow-down. A host of other
observational tests support the conclusion: dark matter is not
there. The implications of this are nothing short of a revision of
Einstein’s theory of gravitation. Why the scientific community is in
denial about the falsification of the dark matter model is a question
that requires both a sociological and philosophical explanation,
argues Pavel Kroupa"
