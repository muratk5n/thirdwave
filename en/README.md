Davis: "Ukraine Got Its Miracle In Taking Kherson Without A Fight (But
Winter Is Coming).. By surrendering Kherson city without a fight and
blowing the bridges over the Dnipro, [RU General] Surovikin has
preserved 30,000 of his best-trained and experienced troops for use in
the coming offensive, sealed off the southern front from a risk of a
Ukrainian flanking action and will soon have a massive new force to
employ...

Once this force is ready to launch Putin‚Äôs winter offensive (likely in
late December/early January when the ground has sufficiently frozen),
it will likely be preceded by a massive new attack on the Ukrainian
energy infrastructure to plunge the country into darkness, cripple the
remainder of its electrified rail system, and significantly hamper the
government‚Äôs ability to supply its troops with basic needs"

Example, 490 polled say candidate A, 470 say candidate B, out of 1000
percenages say A is ahead 49% vs 47%. Compute conf

```python
def d(k,n): m=k/n; return m,1.96*np.sqrt(m*(1-m)/n)

n = 1000.; a=490; b=470
m,t = d(a,n)
print (np.round([m-t,m+t],2))
m,t = d(b,n)
print (np.round([m-t,m+t],2))
```

```text
[0.46 0.52]
[0.44 0.5 ]
```

Intervals overlap. Can't be sure.

---

$X = X_1 + X_2 + .. + X_n $ approaches Normal due to CLT, standardize
w $Z = X - np / \sqrt{np(1-p)}$, create conf intervals.

---

Assume indiv poll results are distributed Bernoulli, then the sum via
CLT gives Gaussian approximation. Calculate conf interval from that,
for both candidates, if intervals overlap, the win ain't sure.

"How can you determine if a poll result 'too close to call'?"

Electrification-tards feel that rocket burn on their butt cheeks right

the most powerful rocket runs on it.
