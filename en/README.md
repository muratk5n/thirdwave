H2 View: "Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus Council established ahead of
widespread H2 rollout...  The new Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus Council has
been launched at a time when investments into H2-powered public
transport are exploding"

---

H2 View: "ArcelorMittal invests $5m in H2Pro to support its disruptive
hydrogen production method from water. E-TAC water splitting offers
energy efficiency of over 95%, significantly higher than traditional
water electrolysis technologies"

---

H2 Fuel News: "Saudi Arabia sets sights on hydrogen fuel cells and
sustainable fuels.. The announcement regarding the contracts was made
by Saudi Arabia’s energy ministry. The contracts are for the
development of carbon-free projects such as hydrogen fuel cells for
transportation, and sustainable jet fuel production. They are meant to
help the largest crude exporter in the world to shift its leadership
into 'all areas of energy, as it has been in the oil industry for over
80 years,' explained energy minister..  in an official statement
following the signing ceremony which took place in Riyadh"

SolarPaces: "[T]he developer and builder of the 22.5 GW Three Gorges
Dam in China – will develop three of China’s planned new 100 MW
Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) tower projects, two in China’s sunny
Qinghai province"

TR [solar map](../tr/2022/01/solar-map.md). CSP info included. Surely
the EU would be a willing customer.

OO was seen as a way to be more "scientific" about IT software,
hilarious bcz one cannot be less scientific then by going to smallest
particle level.. The OO approach did not save projects which typically
went over-time and over-budget at a rate of 1/2. They still do. For
bigger projects the failure rate is even higher, a whopping 4/5. 

---

For Valley, IT programmers the particle, and their interactions,
*simulation* viewpoint is more comfortable.. Their bean counting is
done discretely, item-by-item basis, which makes sense you are
automating an office work, keeping lists, checking them off...  The
so-called object-orientation took hold in the industry possibly for
this reason.  Interesting its widely used language C++ was based on an
older language called Simula, the first OO language, literally built
for simulations.

With OO the idea was coders would create "Customer objects" which
interacted with "Order objects", so the entire system would be seen as
a "simulation" btw these little particles..

NDTV: "Denmark is set to become the first European Union country to
lift domestic curbs despite the Omicron wave sweeping the continent..

Denmark will remove virtually all Covid restrictions from next Tuesday
despite record infections, counting on a high vaccination rate to cope
with the milder Omicron variant, the government said...

The successful vaccine programme proved a 'super-weapon', [PM]
said. 'It has given us a solid defence against infection that
continues.. That's why the government decided that coronavirus should
no longer be considered a threatening disease for society.'

Faced with a lower level of hospitalisations than in previous waves,
several European countries, including France, Ireland and the United
Kingdom, have announced the lifting or a considerable reduction of
their restrictions, despite record or very high cases"

A little piece I wrote for @QuantaMagazine -- hope you enjoy it! It
starts with a famous puzzle posed to Johnny von Neumann about two
bicycles and a fly.

God does not need math, He has an obscene amount of computation power
embedded in nature. Mathematics is our invention, a tool that was
created to address our shortcomings.

"Does the running of Nature, The Grand Simulation, or the current
order of our things require mathematics, in the background?"

CIA likely stirred shit up leading to pro-Russian Yanukovich's ouster,
but left to its own devices democracy long-term would have balanced
things out.. A major voter base for Yanukovich was the RU speaking
parts of Ukraine, so the next guy would have to pander to them, and
indirectly to Russia for votes. Those regions are now gone. If UKR at
least tried to balance RU against the West before, they'll never do
that now.

Language is not a good indicator for cultural similarity; Asia Minor
speaks Turkish but it is not Turkic, partly Hellenic similar to Greece
(who speak Greek). US and UK speak English but are different. AFAIK
Ukranians are culturally similar to Russians.

"Can Russians understand Ukrainian?.. No, despite all the claims that
Russians and Ukrainians are Slavic brothers, Russians won't understand
Ukrainian"

Federal Reserve points to interest rate hike coming in March

Sadly "AI" could not do that today. Data has to be curated, by real
people.

---


Military activity data shared by API (simple URL, JSON output) through
journos would be great..  Liveuamap has paywall. Just types of attack,
hardware used, estimated damage, and numbers involved.

They cld make money from that; For every major event, sharing
up-to-date geolocated, structured data.. What happened, where, to
whom? People would curate it in the background, and more frequent,
special access could pay for the service costs..

When did Kiev become Kyiv? So it's now Chicken Kyiv, not Chicken Kiev?

---

"Another batch of US defensive security assistance, including around
300 Javelins and ammunition, just arrived in Kyiv, Ukraine"

---

Tax and.. stop outsourcing, strengthen unions to get higher wages and
higher interest rates so speculators are discouraged do go after
bizarre stocks, the housing market inflating prices there. IOW: a
systemic fix.

Still good.. Pre-pandemic too
