H2 Fuel News: "[Senators] Coons,.. Cornyn... introduced the new
Hydrogen for Trucks Act, S 3806. It was introduced to support the
widespread adoption of hydrogen fuel cell trucks, heavy duty vehicles
and fueling stations. Moreover, companion legislation has been
introduced in the House, HR 7064 by Representatives Katie Porter
(D-California) and Gus Bilirakis (R-Florida)"

Same argument applies for ammonia (clean H2 carrier) or LH2, CH2.
Base molecules as fuel, as energy carrier / storage are efficient.

Dude. I'm so bored already.

*Picard* is turning into STE *In a Mirror Darkly*.. The engineer gets

The AI mentioned is weak AI, some dumb neural network with lots of data
stuffed in at best. Or it's misuse of terminology, a statistical model
plus some optimization.

Back during WWI artillery at least had some adventure, 'battlefield
bravery' associated with it, one tactic had infantry advance under
artillery protection / shelling ahead of troops, so when soldiers
reached their target the place would be enemy-free. Troops had to move
very carefully tho, otherwise u get hit too..? The danger!.. I believe
Canada used this technique succesfully a few times (yes, Canada!).

Nowadays after the advent of radio communication, it's all different.
Infantry will explore, pick a target, report back to artillery group,
who will bomb the place from 20 kilometers away. The poor sod getting
blown up won't know what hit him, being shelled by someone who has no
idea who he is, identified by infantry who is completely seperate from
the bombing itself. Tis the modern war.

---

It's true.. 

Al Jazeera: "'This fighting is not how you imagine it from the
movies,' said [Ukrainian filmmaker] Sentsov.. 'Close contact, shooting
from small arms, there is not so much of it. Most of the time this is
artillery and your task is to hold the front line in the trenches, and
not to die from the shelling'

---

I see; if captured they could be used as a propaganda tool.. makes
sense
