Lavo: "BBQ functions in a unique manner by relying on heat exchange
technology, a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen to create
heat and disperse it to the hotplate. This solution delivers a
barbeque that operates without flames, only producing heat and steam
as a by-product, the portable BBQ hotplate can reach 200 degrees
Celsius"

UNSW and Lavo already created a prototype for that H2 BBQ
machine. Excellent.

Here's an idea: don't unclog it.

"The commercial pipeline that each year brings $1 trillion worth of
toys, clothing, electronics and furniture from Asia to the United
States is clogged and no one knows how to unclog it"

Spotify... FYI, Focker is an early [investor](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Other-Podcasts-Partners-etc/Get-Peter-Thiel-s-Founder-s-Fund-out-of-Spotify-s-financing/td-p/1571394)
there.

The gateway drug for the corrupt liberterian circles funded by Thiel
money seem to be anti-Wokeism (SJW is a problem but no need for these
muckers to fight it), and an excessive distaste for any governance,
electoral politics, etc.. The shtick attracts ppl from left or right
-- not anyone bright, fortunately.

Apparently the plant they talk about is one of the biggest polluters
in UK. Green groups naturally object.

Here's a way to look at it; Carbon was taken off the air, why put it
back in?

"[P]lans are being pioneered by [UK] Drax Group, which claims that
burning wood pellets is carbon-neutral because trees absorb as much
carbon dioxide when they grow as they emit when they are
burnt. Capturing the carbon emissions from biomass power plants would
then effectively create 'negative carbon emissions', according to
Drax"

Tech CEOs.. These guys mostly throw stuff into a bowl and see what
comes out.. some are better at it than others, like Jobs. Genius inventors? By even as
late as 2006 Apple was trying to stuff a phone [into an iPod](2021/10/the-one-device-merchant.md).
Imagine that, trying to dial people with that wheel..

"Steve Jobs was a genius. How dare you? He invented the iPhone"

So that governments [can fuel](2021/10/entrepreneuel-state-mazzucato.md#jobs) the
research that companies like theirs feast off regularly.

"Why should companies pay their taxes, like Apple?"
