Beans alone do not supply the 9 essential aminos, but rice and beans
do (no wonder the combo is a staple in some cuisines). Rice and peas
work also.

These news cld interpreted it either way. If RU ever wanted to turn on

A regular 48-inch hydrogen pipeline [can carry](https://gasforclimate2050.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2020_European-Hydrogen-Backbone_Report.pdf)
13 Gigawatts. Little back-of-the envolope calculation; One person in the
developed world consumes 10 KW, this means a *single* H2 pipeline
can supply energy to 1.3 million people ðŸ˜¶

That is a city the size of Ottowa, Zurich, or Belgrade.

One can learn abt government while in military.. It's **a** branch of
government after all.. For example how do they handle purchasing? A
new equipment is needed, what are the channels to get it done? You are
given a rifle, a cantine, whatever, how is that tracked?  Maybe that
information can help you understand the post office, or FEMA, or name
it, any other government agency. Even as a grunt, we might dismiss it
being at the bottom of the hierarchy, but in many ways everything
revolves around the grunt, his ass needs to be carried to and from the
"theather of action", provided food for, resting env, the grunt will
experience all that, first hand. I'd call that relevant experience.
