Devine, *Laptop from Hell*: "Five days after Costello’s late-night
call, on Wednesday, October 14, 2020, the *New York Post* published
the first of a series of front-page bombshells,.. culled from the
contents of Hunter’s laptop. The story, headlined 'Biden’s Secret
Emails,' revealed a bombshell 2015 email indicating that Joe, as vice
president, had met in Washington with a high-ranking representative of
the corrupt Ukrainian energy company that was paying his junkie son a
million dollars a year to sit on its board. Eight months after the
meeting, Joe flew to Kyiv and threatened to withhold $1 billion in US
aid unless the Ukrainian government fired its top prosecutor, Viktor
Shokin, who was pursuing Burisma for corruption at the time. The email
was news, in anyone’s language.

But soon after the Post’s story broke online, social media censored
it. Facebook announced it had throttled the story’s reach. Twitter
locked the Post’s account for two weeks, then admitted after the
election that it had made a mistake. It was a chilling exercise of raw
political power by an unaccountable Big Tech—the term given to the
oligopoly of global corporations that dominate the information
technology industry.

The coordinated censorship of America’s oldest newspaper, with the
fourth largest circulation in the nation, amounted to election
interference. It was a historic moment that rang alarm bells around
the world and would harden resolve on Capitol Hill to rein in the
power of the social media giants"

The Hunter Biden thing surfacing again might have to do with the
establishment giving a message to WH.. The current state of play in
UKR is no good, largely US's fault, and the HB expose is key bcz there
is the word 'Ukraine' written all over it.

---

This is good

F24: "Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky made a fresh appeal for
meaningful talks with Moscow on Saturday to end the war as Russia said
its soldiers had entered the centre of the besieged city of Mariupol,
'tightening the noose' around the key port"

---

Various end results for UKR-RU are possible .. One assesment I saw
claimed RU will take everything east of the Dnipro river; i.e. all of
Eastern Ukraine. UKR is close in culture to Russians, but the East is
even more so.. Then maybe RU is feeling out how things develop, doing
a little head fake on the North, but invading strongly from Southeast,
and if no agreement is forthcoming, no substantial concessions in tune
of what they wanted, they'll just take Eastern Ukraine and call it a
day.

Combined geographically w previously acquired regions, the whole block
actually makes sense, there is a geographical boundary between East
and West anyway, a river, and it connects nicely with the 'seperatist'
regions, plus Crimea. RU's needed 'buffer' will get bigger, and the
remaining gov in the West will probably not utter the word NATO ever
again.

---

Today India and Russia need eachother in case of a resurgent China and
China needs Russia against what they view as a overly meddling
West. So I dont think "the Quad", or any other pact can override the
India-Russia relationship.

I wouldnt expect too much from pulling India out of its Russia
friendship either..  See history (above)

The Guardian: "Beijing’s readout of the [Biden-Xi] call did not
suggest any Chinese role in ending the war. It quoted Xi as referring
to a favourite aphorism, 'Let he who tied the bell on the tiger’s neck
take it off' , a seeming reference to China’s position that the US and
Nato are ultimately to blame"

"The U.S. believed that a brief period of non-assertive foreign policy
from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s had become the new norm for
Russia. This period was not the norm but an anomaly. Putin’s foreign
policy has always been assertive, similar to Russia’s historic foreign
policy"

Al Jazeera: "This is not the time to brand Vladimir Putin an ‘evil
madman’. Simplifying the war in Ukraine into a binary of ‘good’ versus
‘evil’ will not save us from another world war...

Whether it’s describing Saddam Hussein as a 'madman,' Gaddafi as
'insane,' or Putin as a 'megalomaniac,' such caricatures serve broader
political objectives by simplifying any conflict into a clear binary
of 'good' versus 'evil'... The Israeli state often indulges in such
framing to delegitimise Palestinians – even questioning their
intelligence, by repeating ad nauseum the trope that they 'never lose
an opportunity to lose an opportunity'...

Such framing is now being tactfully employed to
explain away the Russian invasion of Ukraine – a manipulative
discourse construction that facilitates a fog of war"
