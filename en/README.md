H2 Fuel News: "Floating green hydrogen production vessel under
development.. A statement from RINA explained that the Thessalonica
Hydroship will be able to produce renewable H2 by using wind and tidal
stream turbines to generate the electricity to power the
electrolysis. This way, using Floating production storage and
offloading (FPSO) is unnecessary, substantially reducing the overall
levelized cost of energy (LCOE) to generate cost competitive H2
fuel. The vessel will be constructed using off-the-shelf electrolyzers
and ready-made wind and tidal stream turbine"

'First commercial scale hydrogen-to-MCH' project.. Interesting.
Posted about MCH [here](2020/10/methyl-cyclohexane-h2.md).

"PETRONAS Hydrogen.. and ENEOS Corporation.. have signed a Joint
Feasibility Study Agreement (JFSA) to advance the studies for a
commercial hydrogen production and conversion project in [Malaysia].

Under the JFSA, both parties will pursue detailed technical and
commercial feasibility studies for the production of low carbon
hydrogen from PETRONASâ€™ existing facilities, production of green
hydrogen from a new hydro-powered electrolyser facility, and hydrogen
conversion into methylcyclohexane (MCH). The agreement is part of the
long-term [MoU] signed last August for the development of a clean
hydrogen supply chain between Malaysia and Japan.

The facilities are projected to have a total hydrogen production and
conversion capacity of up to 50,000 tonnes per annum (50KTPA) by 2027
for export in MCH form to Japan, where the clean hydrogen will be
distributed to Japanese industries through ENEOSâ€™ refineries. Once
onstream, the project could potentially be the first commercial scale
hydrogen-to-MCH undertaking in the world...

Through ENEOS, this hydrogen-to-MCH project has been selected as one
of the Green Innovation Fund project by the Japanese Government, a
testament to the project's viability and competitiveness which is a
critical aspect in the development of the nascent clean hydrogen
supply chain"

'If more people had a voice outcome wld be different?'. The mass

who can then shape the opinion. Have a voice, fine, but modern society
