Sorta remember the cold.. I was in the hood

"12/3/1993 storm, named the Storm of the Century, hit an area so large
stretched from Honduras to Canada".

WB/Munger joint interviews are hilarious. Munger keeps calling other
approaches "twaddles".

Buy/hold is not always boring. Can still do quickies, bcz you know
something others dont, the company is good.. Falls will be accompanied
by rises, there'll be return to trend.

But these days ironically Berksh has a lot of cash in hand; cant find
good companies to invest in or cant find any good company that is not
overvalued? ðŸ¤”  Probably the latter.

So Buffett / Munger approach is not timing the market, buy stock if
value looks good, dont wait for "correction". 60/40, 70/30 doesnt
matter (as in stocks/bonds), it's all about companies. Diversification
doesn't matter which in their method is a sign of ignorance. There is
no "cash position", u end up with it if cant find a good company to
invest in, it is not an investment vehicle.

*Apex*, *Fortress*.. so many cheesy WIllis movies in succession.. Is
Trying to stumble upon the next *Pulp Fiction*, not working

*Finch* is supposed to take place in 2030 -- 9 years away.. And the
roboticist guy had strong AI tech? Sci wouldn't have advanced that
far.. not with the current neural, "deep" approaches. He'd have the
dog and some bizarre chatbot that spits out random facts from
Encyclopedia Brittanica. I'd rather have all published novels be read
aloud to me through Text-to-Speech, or have re-runs of MASH.

*I Am Mother*, *Finch*, sad movies.. Where's da hope man?
