H2 Central: "Electrolyser capital costs have fallen from more than
$3,700 per kW in 2020 to about 2,700 dollar per kW today and will drop
to below 200 dollar per kW by 2050 under the agency’s most optimistic
scenario. Under its most pessimistic scenario, capital costs will
decline to about 800 dol per kW, national science agency CSIRO said in
its annual GenCost report.

The main driver of falling electrolyser costs will be scale as the
size of systems grows from an average of 10 MW today to 100 MW modular
units in the coming years, CSIRO said.

CSIRO, said: 'Applying typical engineering cost scaling factors this
movement to full scale accounts for around an 80% reduction in
costs'. Electrolyser deployment is being supported by a substantial
number of hydrogen supply and end- use trials globally and in
Australia.'"

Update on energy production by source, new data from BP. Renewables
don't look good. The 2% guesstimate checks out in the data (1.9% to be
exact -see the pie chart-).

Am all for green power gen. Until we get there, clean (blue) fuel
generation from fossil with CCUS should be fine. A perfectly reachable
goal.

---

Is that significant? Only 20% of overall energy consumption is
electicity, which means 2% of overall energy production is wind and
solar.

CNN: "Wind and solar generated a record 10% of the world's power in
2021, report shows"

They jumped from one dubious concept to another... What's next? The

Voit: "Each summer for nearly a quarter-century there has been a big
yearly conference bringing together the string theory community..
Taking a look at the program, one thing that stands out is that the
string theory community has almost completely stopped doing string
theory...but.. the string theory community has found to replace string
theory: black holes"
