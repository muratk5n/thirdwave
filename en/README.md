I like that everyone gets coin tho it needs to happen continuously
expanding the money base, inflating away stashed wealth while
providing UBI. Also iris image capture -> id generation doesn't sound
secure.

AFP: "The World Health Organization said Thursday that 80,000 to
180,000 health care workers may have been killed by Covid-19 up to May
this year, insisting they should be prioritised for vaccination"

This supersonic stuff is fine and dandy but if there are nuke-powered
nuke-armed subs in play, retaliation after a surprise attack is still
possible. Then you are back to M.A.D.

I bet the script was written by a major scifi fan; used stuff from SG
Atlantis where Momoa played in, there JM constantly punks another
character, they had a similar act in *Dune*.

*Dune* looked great cinematically. Acting top notch. It cld have moved
faster though and showed the events around fremen rebellion, it sort
of feels empty without that part. The 2000 miniseries did better
there.
