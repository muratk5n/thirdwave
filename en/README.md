H2 Fuel News: "Hydrogen fuel planes and power plants will be here
sooner than later.. Electrification isn’t the fastest decarbonization
strategy for aviation and other industries. Hydrogen fuel stock is
rising thanks to funding for regional hydrogen hubs and the expansion
of tax credits like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). More financial
support for H2 development and adoption means that costs can come
down, making it possible to decarbonize transportation industries that
are not easily electrified at a rapid pace, like long-haul trucks,
trains, and planes"

Lerner, 1992, *The Big Bang Never Happened*: "Overwhelming mass of
scientific evidence still contradicts the Big Bang, as this book
endeavors to show. As of this writing.. [BB] remains in just as deep
trouble as ever, with even wider divergence from observation than when
the first edition of this book was completed in late 1990... In the
year and a half since this book was written, the evidence against the
Big Bang has grown stronger, and the COBE results, far from 'proving'
the theory, have not in any way resolved the problems raised by other
discoveries. The key problem.. is that there are objects in the
universe— huge conglomerations of galaxies—that are simply too big to
have formed in the time since the Big Bang, objects whose age is
greater than the age Big Bang cosmologists assign to the universe
itself"

instead advances a non-standard plasma cosmology originally proposed
in the 1960s by Hannes Alfvén, the 1970 Nobel Prize recipient in
Physics"

With the right tech though crypto, or cybercurrencies, could truly be
decentralized and be useful; require no mining, even have social
add-on features like digital UBI. Not there yet.
