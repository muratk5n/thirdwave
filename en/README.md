BREAKING NEWS: House Democrats announce plans to end Trump’s tax
giveaway to billionaires and corporations by raising taxes on
corporations, Wall Street, companies with foreign corporate income,
and people who make over $5 million a year"

It's sad how derivative things are in China. US started talking about
anti-trust, CH copies it. There is US judgement on external links from
Apple Store, similar issues are talked about in China. Why didn't you
think of this shit before, on your own?

At a wide level, on general issues, trying to convince others on views
is like asking others to change their weight estimate of an ox in
[this experiment](2020/07/crowd-wisdom.md). Only with independent
views, the average corrects the error. Ergo if we force someone to
change their estimate, say from 300 to 200, that would throw off the
average. The conclusion becomes erroraneous.

first ship in the world to be equipped with an ammonia-based fuel

At its height Jerry Springer's show was beating Oprah; and all they
did was fight.. Such pure trash.

*The Jerry Springer Show*, *American Idol* were definitely the
stepping stones to the eventual *Hunger Games*. If you think about it,
there is a connection.

There will never be long-term unity, but if there are distinct
ideologies in distinct parties around major issues, that will ease
agreement on other things.

---

The single-party, Washingon Consensus was so bad around 90s that
Clinton could govern as a Southern Ronald Reagan, and Dubya could
govern as Republican Bill Clinton. Then of course everybody is
invading somewhere, deregulating, making government "small". What do
you have left to do politics over? Enter the culture war.

Iron production plant in Russia, had 700 workers, now 100. Even the
crudest automation can eliminate people. \#3W
