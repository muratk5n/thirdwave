Sales and bullshit is also part of the job. See Jobs [talk at MIT](https://youtu.be/YXUhLbV8Nrg?t=738).
Look how he talks about great rivalries, his new machine / OS NextStep,
the big, bad rival Sun is trying to kill him, he is growing 2x, 4x..

Well; That machine only sold 50,000 units. The OS is a Unix variant
could not have existed without academia. They made changes to it,
added stuff on top, the code would eventually find its way into
iPhones later, changed some more, arriving to its current form which
senior Linux devs still call a piece of shit. Linux is of course open
source, the largest software project ever undertaken by mankind.

Tech CEO is mostly the "getting excited" guy. He'll "get excited" on a
tech be an internal evangelist for it, which can motivate employees to
work on it more, in a sense of "mission". Administrative duties are
important of course, but dont need deep sci mind for that.

Biz does not have the capacity for true research. They think too
short-term, the "need to show something" is too strong. 

"AlphaGo Zero shows that corporate R&D has starved basic research in
favor of safe bets and tinkering at the margins. Deepmind's AlphaGo
Zero — which taught itself to play a remarkable game of Go in just 72
hours — is an ironic poster child for this phenomenon. AlphaGo is part
of a long-term shift in AI research from generating machine
comprehension to "machine learning" that is just a fancy form of
statistical analysis, a brute-force approach that relies on ingesting
lots of human decisions and making statistical observations that can
be used as predictions about the future"

Every student deserves to learn from the best, as I learned from Arthur
Mattuck. Here's my vid based [ed plan]((2018/09/public-education.md))
again.

will continue to teach even after his passing. RIP

We were saddened by the news of MIT Prof. Arthur Mattuck's
passing. Check out his lecture from Differential Equations"

Is growth a good thing? Not sure.. Coca-Cola shits out a **billion**
plastic bottles in a week. Where does all that plastic go? Do we want
a billion *and a half* billion bottles produced in a week? That would
be growth right?

I will be reprocessing the Berkeley data every month, do the YoY
checks, so we all can look at it and weep
