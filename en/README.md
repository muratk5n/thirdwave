"@UTAustin Researchers Just Solved a Major Hurdle-Found a low-cost way
to solve 1/2 of equation, using #sunlight to efficiently split off
oxygen from water"

Interesting

"Nearly 40% of Australia's land is uninhabitable. One reason behind
this large landmass being so desolate is the shortage of rainfall"

For countries who are fully into vaccination, restrictions should be
dropped. From this point on, it's a battle btw the vax, luck, and us.

What is *going on* in Texas?

"Texas state Senate passes bill to eliminate requirements that public
schools teach that the Ku Klux Klan is ‘morally wrong'"

---

Apparently band members went to the same musical academy.. and they
just wanted to do something freely.. I get it now. This is the kind of
stuff you do when u want to 'stretch'. Kinda show off too but it's
about doing whatever, at an extreme.

Dirty Loops has no guitar.. Bass, keyboard, and (crazy) vocals carry
the whole thing..

EPA: "Methane is also a greenhouse gas (GHG), so its presence in the
atmosphere affects the earth's temperature and climate system. Methane
is emitted from a variety of anthropogenic (human-influenced) and
natural sources. ... Methane is more than 25 times as potent as carbon
dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere"

---

BTW all carbon, or GHG emitting rocket fuels need to be banned, eg
methane. New Shep used liquid H2 but I believe their bigger rocket,
and some others in the same scale will use methane - not good.

---

BO demonstrated some capability, more than Virgin perhaps. New Shep
took off on its own, wout riding any other vehicle, then the booster
part returned.. There are more pieces here that can be built up for
grander goals.

---

Blue Origin rocket used liquid H2. Clean fuel.

No you cannot go to space with batteries. Inferior technology.

Good to know

JH: "A fluid may appear in the form of a liquid like water or a gas
like air. Water is virtually incompressible... Air can be viewed to be
incompressible as long as the flow speed is well below the speed of
sound"

Hah. So the discerete (as in quantum) does not reign supreme?

Johan Hoffman, "Applying G2 [a new computational technique] to the
Euler and [Navier-Stokes] equations opens a vast area for exploration,
which we demonstrate by resolving several scientific mysteries,
including d’Alembert’s paradox of zero drag in inviscid flow, the 2nd
Law of thermodynamics and transition to turbulence. We also uncover
several secrets of fluid dynamics including secrets of ball sports,
flying, sailing and racing.  In particular we are led to a new
computational foundation of thermodynamics based on deterministic
microscopical mechanics producing deterministic mean value outputs
coupled with indeterminate pointwise outputs, in which the 2nd Law is
a consequence of the 1st Law. The new foundation of thermodynamics is
not based on microscopical statistics as the statistical mechanics
foundation pioneered by Boltzmann, and thus offers a rational
scientific basis of thermodynamics based on computation, without the
mystery of the 2nd Law in the statistical approach. We believe the new
computational approach also may give insight to physics following the
idea that Nature in one way or the other is performing an analog
computation when evolving in time from one moment to the next"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
