The police is being blamed for not immediately turning on the super
soldier skillset and rush in as if acting in the movie
*Commando*. That type of violence is probably foreign to many of them
in that force.  The point is not to put them, any police, in that
situation, or having those situation be extremely rare. Sadly such
shootings aren't rare these days, due to lax gun laws. You can thank
to Bill Clinton and centrist gamma cuck Dems for that, their their
triangulation finally brought the country here. 5G issues were meant
to be the side-show, creating the illusion of disagreement between
parties while agreeing on everything else (bipartisanship, unity),
allowing corporations buy America. But side issues got worse, people
die, and the unnecessarily funded police is unnecessarily being
accused of why they did not rush in as if acting on *Commando*.

If we fire the Uvalde police chief we will feel much better!! Yey!

The new *Doctor Strange*..  It was pretty average, weak story (also
based on shoddy science -multiverse-). WTF with the zombie stuff I
thought apparently the director had previous zombie cred. Raimi's
earlier work *Spiderman 2* was widely considered as the best comic
book movie adaption until that point, but I cant see that presence
here. He was likely straightjacketed by Marvel.

Hope to see Johnny Depp in future movies now that he cleared his
name.. Back in the day I used to watch *21st Jump Street*. I really
liked *Donny Brasco* BTW, read the book afterwards bcz of the
movie. Forget about it!

It is a "border region" so RU could claim it isn't invading anyone,
but effectively create a supply line to Khaliningrad. A gray area,
with distant Russkies.. this is right up Putin's alley. He might just
go for it.

"An organisation representing residents in the Suwałki Gap – an area
along the Polish-Lithuanian border lying between the Russian exclave
of Kaliningrad and Belarus – has appealed for the authorities to
create emergency shelters in case the Kremlin decides to launch
military action. The corridor has long been seen as a potential weak
point in a war with Russia. Tensions there have recently increased
after Lithuania blocked some goods from being transferred by rail to
Kaliningrad, leading Moscow to warn of 'serious consequences'"
