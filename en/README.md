Annual sum for fire measurements; based on FIRMS [data](https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/country/)

I downloaded select years, 2000,05, etc. Ran the code below, it scans
all countries and counts number of fire (pixels) above a certain
brightness threshold. Results,

```
year 2000 : 144
year 2005 : 4100
year 2010 : 7533
year 2015 : 11607
year 2020 : 16365
```

I'd ignore 2000, looks like measurement issue (or not!). But the rest,
looks really bad. The number of fires increase at an obscene rate.

So this experiment generated 70% of what it put in. Awaiting for
higher Q. 

Wikipedia: "The condition of Q = 1, when the power being released by
the fusion reactions is equal to the required heating power, is
referred to as breakeven"

The rumours are true. [Fusion dev] is a major step forward, a gain [or Q] of 0.7"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
