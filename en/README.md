"The only real war still going on in Syria is about the remaining
Islamic terrorist groups. Most of the remaining Islamic terrorists are
trapped in northern Syria (Idlib province)... [O]ver 30,000 armed
rebels belonging to various Islamic terrorist groups, none of them
affiliated with [ISIS]. There are also nearly a million
civilians. These rebels have nowhere to go and will fight to the death
rather than surrender... The Assads donâ€™t want any 'fight to death'
battle in Idlib and the Russians unofficially propose a more
traditional tactic for this siege situation; starve them out. While an
ancient and often successful tactic, this approach is currently
considered a war crime by most, but not all, nations"

NY Intelligencer: "The moderate Democrats are irrationally worried
about passing a big tax hike on the rich, but they *really* want to
pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill. They see the bipartisan bill
as their golden ticket to showing Republican-leaning voters in their
districts that they can work across party lines"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
