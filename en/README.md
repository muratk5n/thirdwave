'But he resigned due to this reason, that reason'.. The last scandal
wasn't any more 'scandalous' than the one before it; the truth the

useless against Russia, could not entice India to condemn. Abenomics
didn't work, the new PM is now against it. Abe was a right-wing guy
maybe he did some stuff on that front, better mil? He stayed in office
longer than most PMs so he could have provided some stability there.
