TR nemesis Kurdish PKK and sister org YPG are closer to PUK - one
Talabani made a visit to Rojova (YPG stronghold in NE Syria). Barzanis

KRG, Iraqi central gov also have conflicts; after KRG 2017 indep
referandum central gov attacked KRG, took 20% of its land including
Kirkuk - major oil production center.

The loss of Kirkuk then became a PUK-KDP sore spot; PUK reportedly
left the fight, KDP was gung-ho on keeping it, and lost. Major loss of
face for KRG especially KDP. Papa Barzani resigned after that one.

TASS: "The West may be heading for 'a catastrophic stalemate,' at
best, for Ukraine, Sherelle Jacobs, head of the Online Comment at The
Daily Telegraph, wrote on Monday night.

She views a decisive Russian breakthrough in spring as an alternative
scenario. According to her, while Western elites assume that a victory
for the Ukrainians 'must surely be around the corner,' the fact is
that Ukraine is increasingly on the back foot"

of Jupiter 1.0, a Powerful Fuel Cell System for Homes and Small
Buildings..

The planet Jupiter is made up of roughly 90% hydrogen, and similarly,
this PWWR fuel cell converts hydrogen to heat and electricity at
approximately 90% efficiency. Jupiter 1.0 is built to supply power
during peak demand periods and serves as a back-up when required for
homes and small buildings...

Jupiter 1.0, requires fewer components compared to conventional fuel
cells and also eliminates the need for expensive, precious metals"
