Iâ€™m just remembering that my second year in America, someone asked me
to 'validate their parking,' which was my first time hearing the
phrase, and after blinking stupidly in silence for a full five seconds
I said 'Well parking is really hard but Iâ€™m sure you did it really
well'"

just looks so bad.. Imagine amount of copper, steel used in the
construction. A single gas pipeline can replace all of that, *and* perform better.

Advice to their theoreticians; feel free to ignore parts of "known
physics" as needed. For example "theory doesn't fit with CMB". Does
that matter?  That "background" could well be misinterpreted signals
from f-ing New Jersey (instruments were [near there](https://youtu.be/5i6mCNgJNZs?t=348))
and birdshit on the antennas.

Physics of the past 40 years has been a house of cards. A lot of fine
base elements but put together in bizarre ways, with certain pieces
placed, very likely, completely incorrectly (you don't end up in this
state by overlooking one or two things). Just like there are ppl today
who think electrification is the way for green energy, I am sure there
are many in Phy with similar delusional ideas, all the while believing
they are being reasonable.

I see, there have been fluidic space theories, trying to explain
gravity, one including dark matter, dark energy..  Good stuff..

An air bubble in water rises up to surface.. There is more pressure at
the bottom of it than at the top. More pres at the bottom bcz more
fluid there relative to top, more weight, creating pressure
difference.

If space is seen as fluidic, planet gravitational pull can be
explained similarly perhaps?  This fluid is extremely dense (according
to a yet unknown measure), denser further from bodies, and relative to
that planet bodies are like air, so "bubbles", ie other bodies are
pushed towards it, explaining the pull..? ðŸ¤”

Using coffee beans ground into a fine powder, then boiled in a little
[brass pot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FB9mjc0XMAU_YNS?format=jpg&name=small)
is called different names by countries, with many laying claim on its
invention. But that style of coffee making was first invented in Yemen; so it
should be called Yemenese coffee.

That actually looked funny \#Lenox \#KO
