Heliogen went public recently. They received $39 million grant from
DOE, steel maker ArcelorMittal invested. 

On the residential / industrial division: homes would still receive
CSP power through their tech operated by utilities, so people will
benefit, and they don't have install an entire solar farm in their
backyard. That's good; CSP's focus is massive scale, availability,
this is where it shines (!)

Gov did good here.. They looked at the tech, pondered what is needed
to advance it, and boom! A whole new consortium.

Energy.gov: "Heliostat Consortium..  is funded by the .. DOE.. A
heliostat is a device that continually tilts a mirror or multiple
mirror facets to track the sun’s movement in order to reflect sunlight
toward a predetermined target—such as a receiver sitting on top of a
solar tower. Heliostats are a critical component of CSP"

I checked the data, Granger causality shows the two-year treas affects
FEDFUNDS little more than the other way around. Both sides would read
eachother obviously try to gauge reaction to events, but since for
bonds inflation is a risk, they can't not rise in yields in response
to rising inflation. In turn the overnight borrowing rates between
banks cannot be neutral to that (which is what FEDFUNDS is), they'd
lose money on a daily basis. So FED wld be forced to follow the bond
market.

"Although it is still debatable whether the Fed leads or follows the
market, movements in the policy rate are associated with similar
movements in short-term interest rates [as in treasury bonds]"

Vox: "'Money feeling strange in 2021 is based on a decade of money
slowly feeling strange for lots and lots of different people
throughout the world,' said .. professor.. So much of the economy
feels like a scam — the gig economy, student loans, the hope of
retirement, a 9-to-5 job. Consumers are always being tricked and
squeezed by corporations. The promise of the middle class is fading
fast, so for a lot of people, it just feels like you might as well
lean into whatever financial chaos is available to try to hit it
big. If housing prices are so high you’re never going to be able to
own a home, why not try your hand at real estate in whatever the
metaverse is?"

Not suprising, humans are not built to run that way; Nike marketing
advertised such style of running so they could [sell products for it](2019/12/civilized-to-death.md#nike).

As we see again, regular people were taken for fools. They have no
mechanism to protect against such interjections whatsoever. Gov can
help.

We dont use particles to calculate fluids.

This is *key* to understand how modern science is conducted.
[Food for thought](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=13fTfDxQdQ6oFKKkKbNcuAbHD-P7un6Q-).

"But if we use particles to simulate a fluid, why not using brain
particles (neurons) take us closer to human level intelligence?"

"It has happened again. Microsoft and Nvidia have built [NN] three
times the size of GPT-3, the former holder of the title. However, in
contrast with GPT-3, this new model hasn’t caused any commotion,
neither in the press nor in the AI community. And there’s a reason for
that...

Do we really need yet another biggest neural network?.. What are the
consequences of following the path of scaling models ad infinitum —
for the AI community in particular, and the world in general? Wouldn’t
it be better if we gave more space to other approaches to AI and
artificial general intelligence (AGI)?..

[NN based Large language model] LLMs have been recently entitled
'foundation models' by dozens of Stanford researchers. They argue that
these ever-larger neural networks comprise “an emerging paradigm for
building artificial intelligence systems.” But not all AI experts
agree with this fancy title.

Jitendra Malik, a professor of computer science at Berkeley says that
'the term ‘foundation’ is horribly wrong.' Adding, 'The language we
have in these models is not grounded, there is this fakeness, there is
no real understanding.' Mark Riedl, a professor at the Georgia Tech
School said on Twitter that “branding very large pre-trained neural
language models as 'foundation' models is a brilliant .. PR stunt.”..

But 'foundation models' isn’t the only title the AI community has
given to LLMs. In a paper dating March 2021 Emily M. Bender, Timnit
Gebru, and others called these models 'stochastic parrots.'"

Aaand they apparently created an even bigger NN, "AI" recently and
noone cared. Story above.

86 billion neurons in the brain.. The so-called GPT3 neural net had

half-asleep with 100% accuracy. I need such code to filter news
stories. Where is it?

US was for the integration news says.. Coons went there? Was he
speaking for the gov?

"From a Gulf perspective, the benefits of a coup [in Sudan] are
limited..  the coup now exposes the strong asymmetry between the
military and civilians. Moreover, Gulf states are aware that the
Sudanese military and the security forces are deeply divided. While
the coup gives the army a false appearance of unanimity, it only
postpones future confrontations with the paramilitary Rapid Support
Forces, headed by Hemedti"

The Sudanese PM resigned, probably not wanting to be cucked anymore by
the military already running everything.

I want to hear more abt that Hemedti guy though.. Sup with him
