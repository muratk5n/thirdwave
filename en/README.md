Pakistan has good potential. 10 Terrawatts.

"In this study..  [we investigated] Direct Normal Irradiance, air
temperature,.. at different timescales and locations over
Pakistan... In the second part, spatial feasibility and Analytical
Hierarchy Process based site suitability is assessed.. Moreover,
multi-parametric evaluation of techno-economic potential is performed
using bias-corrected datasets... Additionally, cost of water usage is
introduced in estimation of Levelized Cost of Electricity besides
other parameters. Cumulative power capacity potential of 10,035 GW is
identified for country, with net cost estimated below 0.096
USD/kWh. Nine sites are found to have generation potential greater
than 1200 TWh/year, the individual capacity to fulfil total predicted
energy demand of the country for year 2030"

```python
bats = 28 # GWh
need = (157481*1000) / (365*8)
print ("%d GWh" % need)
print ('%0.2f percent' % (bats / need * 100))
```

```text
53931 GWh
0.05 percent
```

Current installed bat capacity is enough for only 0.05 percent of the
global demand. Double it, triple it, still won't make a dent. Mine
all the lithium, cannot handle more than 5% of need.

12 GW/28 GWh? Charge/recharge every 2-3 hours.. Within that time
period the world consumption requires **53,931** GWh of
storage. This tech is a piece of shit.

TDB: "Biden Finds Unity on Ukraine, But Little Else in First State of
the Union..

Less than 10 months ago, President Joe Biden came before Congress and
laid out an ambitious domestic agenda..

With much of that agenda dead, his approval rating near record lows,
and a Russian invasion of Ukraine suddenly seizing the attention of
both the administration and an anxious world, Biden pivoted to a
foreign policy-heavy address Tuesday night"

---

"Iran's leader says Ukraine is 'victim' of US policy.. said US
policies are to blame for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, calling for an
end to the war that broke out last week. 'The root cause of the
Ukraine crisis is the US and the West's policies.. The United States
regime is a crisis-creating and crisis-living one. It feeds on
crisis'"

So *The West Wing*.. trying to look, sound intelligent through
day-trader quant-like correlation-speak (mostly spurious) while the
real world rolls on. This is what a section of Dems have become; white
collar office dwelling dickwads passing papers to eachother in the
hallway trying to look cool. Let's hope the 'evil Putin' mantra is
enough to lull everyone into forgetting what happened, and wasn't made
to happen.

And that 'frozen ground', 'waiting for thaw' shit was truly the low
point of this whole endevor. Where did that come from? NYT?

"Predicting" UKR invasion a few weeks ahead with boat loads of IMINT,
SIGINT and God knows what else is not some magic skill. The real skill
wld be to proactively act, months, years ago in ways so invasion is
made unnecessary through some diplom and horse trading (where US/UKR
gave some and obtained peace in return). Unless of course what is
taking place now was also ok for US.
