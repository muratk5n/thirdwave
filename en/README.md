H2 Central: "War Drives $73bn Spend on Green Hydrogen.... Germany,
Morocco and the United States have pledged most, the report

South Africa, Morocco and Chile controlling most (68 million tonnes)"

predict flooding] including those related to model structure, lack of
mechanistic representation of key processes, and coarse spatial
resolution, pose limits"

Bhadrakumar: "The EU has now become a captive market for Big Oil and
is left to buy LNG from the US at the asking price, which is six to
seven times higher than the domestic price in the US.. The Americans
are cocooned in a surreal world of their self-serving narrative that
Russia ‘lost’ the war. In the real world, though, [.. things looks
different]"
