No I dont judge Baldwin for using guns in movies.. There is no
'gotcha' here. Reagan, a conservative, used a gun on the big screen,
and he was for gun control. Films are escapism.

"Charly Coleman, a Wilmington-based armorer with a decade’s experience
in film.. said he has anticipated an accident, such as the one on the
set of 'Rust,' for six months. The demand for content, stemming from a
rise in streaming platforms, has productions working under tight and
rushed schedules"

TDB: "It has been a summer of scrutiny for the ultra-rich—and now the
billionaires are fighting amongst themselves. The culprit: a so-called
'Billionaire Income Tax', that Democrats in Congress are reportedly
mulling to help finance Biden’s agenda. The proposal would only target
several hundred of the wealthiest Americans by taxing the rising
values of certain assets, like stocks, even before they are sold...

'I know a lot of people that… have accumulated massive, massive
wealth, and then they take loans against that to live on. And that's
tax free. And I think it’s bullshit' [.. one] said"

Not just plant based stuff.. people will burn whatever, wood, cheap
coal.. They'll burn f-ing cow dung. And that shit (!) has lota methane

People in Northern Syria use olive oil extract to make a flammable
[product](https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/syria/2021/10/18/syrian-workers-use-olive-oil-to-make-eco-friendly-pomace-wood-in-pictures/)
for heating (by "eco-friendly" they mean that carbon neutralness
again, but still it is harmful). I bet stuff like this contributes a
lot to the CO2 uptick during the winters. Lay in the pipe for these
places for renewable gas, or send canisters, make'm cheap, done.

Report shows 90% carbon capture rates both for coal and natgas. 

US DOE: "Steam reforming of natural gas for hydrogen production costs
vary from 1.43/kg to 2.27/kg [dollars] with CO2 capture and storage
(CCS) and are highly dependent on the delivered natural gas
price. Numerous studies report the cost of hydrogen from gasification
[from coal] to vary between 1.16/kg and 1.63/ kg for coal and between
1.31/kg and 2.06/kg for coal/biomass/waste plastic with CO2 capture
and storage"

In 2019, EU's gross electricity production was 2904 TWh. In output
capacity terms,

```python
"%d GW" % (2904000 / 365.0 / 24)
```

```text
Out[1]: '331 GW'
```

The planned H2 capacity compares well with the number above.. The plan
will likely encourage others to jump in, it wld be great to equal that
331 GW. 

Green Tech Media: "The EU wants 40 gigawatts of electrolyzers installed within its borders by 2030"
