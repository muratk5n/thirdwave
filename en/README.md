Seriously the younger son even looks less inbred compared to the royal
fam

Well this sounds like a major PR problem.. the fix would be Charles
abdicating, and then the son married to a non-white becomes Kang. PR
problem solved. It has been *foretold by the prophecy*.

TDB: "Removing One Royal Racist Is Nothing. We Need to Abolish the
Monarchy.. The shock and horror professed by so many white people at
the latest royal racism controversy is not shared by many Black
people. For us, there is only a sense of weariness because we have
heard it all before. Its significance is just to show how utterly
impossible it is for the royal family to ever move beyond racism"

\#ReferenceLetters for jobs are the biggest gate-keeper in #academia

My week was rough - I skipped applying to an interesting job that
would have needed 3 references.

What is wrong with the system:

1. References create a system of life-long dependencies with supervisors  

2. They exclude those who are shy about asking for favors 

3. Referees have STRONG biases and they play out 

4. switching fields is bad

@Odedrechavi wrote about abolishing - I fully agree!"

The funny thing is when people get the techy money that is supposed to
do away with the middleman, they go straight to a middlemen and dump their
shiny new money on them.

Every time Sam brings up 'FTX was a margin exchange' he is
intentionally trying to spin the narrative into a risk management
failure when the insolvency came from the embezzlement of the
”mislabeled fiat stub account” of $8bn and other things"
