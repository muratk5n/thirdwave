No, since M4A will cost *less*, it would be deflationary. You'd be
spending smaller amt for the same (better) service.

Assange is an Oz citizen. This is their deputy PM talking.

"'Assange was not in breach of any Australian laws at the time of his
actions. Assange was not in the US when the event being deliberated in
a court now in London occurred,' Mr Joyce wrote... 'The question is
then: Why is he to be extradited to the US? If he insulted the Koran,
would he be extradited to Saudi Arabia?'"

Corportions know that full well of course; they sponsor and help
spread the "liberty-centric" message to avoid regulation, increased
taxes (as they were hit with in Mexico) or outright bans.

Some cried foul when authorities (as in NYC muni) tried to clamp down
on sugar, in soda, in foods, etc, labeling it "government intrusion
into daily lives". Many forget preferring sugar over fat, than
creating an env for "exercise nuts" when it didnt work was part of a
misplaced wave that happened outside them as well, outside the control
of regular people. They, their parents followed that dumb ass shit and
ended up here. Now they should not pull out the "intrusion" argument
in the 11th hour when some are trying to fix the problem for
them. Many seem to forget they live in a modern world, where
concentrated, centralized forces roam.
