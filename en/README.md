Oversized EVs waste energy (bc of giant batteries) and also endanger
other road users.

To address EV car bloat, Norwegian officials have proposed a
weight-based fee of NOK 12 ($1.10)/kilo over 500 kilos"

H-Tec Systems presents scalable Hydrogen Cube System..The company
H-Tec Systems from Augsburg presented the Hydrogen Cube System, HCS
for short, to a wider specialist audience at the Hanover Fair 2022...

The Cubes are available both as a closed container solution for
outdoor installation and open for indoor installation. They are
equipped with 18 PEM stacks S450 and integrated process water
treatment and power supply...

<img width="340" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.hzwei.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/4-H-TEC_HCS_5-gross.jpg"/>

Several 2 MW cubes of this system can be combined to form a
multi-megawatt system. A system that is intended to achieve 50 MW in
the long term can also be designed in this way. According to H-Tec
Systems, the cubes achieve a system efficiency of 74 percent. They are
equipped with an integrated process water treatment and power
supply. An HCS system with five units, i.e. with an electrolysis
capacity of 10 MW, can therefore produce 4,500 kg of H 2 per day. That
makes 40 to 50 tank fillings for trucks or buses.

Anything can be string-pickled üêç For coding `base64.encodestring` on
pickle.dumps`. For other direction `loads(base64.decodestring..)`.
`zlib` for compression.  There are some other details, but this is
the gist.

Simple scalable NoSQL DB: N servers, on client calc i = (mod N) on
key, go to host i. Simple load disribution. REST can provide CRUD API,
serialize requests inside one server, storage can be lite sql,
seperate db for each host, objects are encoded via `pickle.dumps` into
string. Lists are on sep table, list name is on one column obj
references on another as key. Easy as Py.
