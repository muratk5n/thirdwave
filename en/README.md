Largest ammonia ship can carry 87,000 m3. With energy density 15.6
MJ/liter, assuming 60 ship deliveries per year,

```python
amm_ship = 87000 * 3 # m3
dens = 15.6*1000 # MJ/m3
mjkwh = 0.27
arrivals = 60
ann_energy = amm_ship * dens * mjkwh * arrivals
print ("%0.1f GW" % (ann_energy / (365*24*1e6)))
```

```text
7.5 GW
```

Nearly 8 GW could be delivered.. Assuming 2 month round trip per ship,
a fleet of 10 ships would be enough? We're talking about huge amt of power,
equivalent to the output of 8 nuclear plants. It could justify a fleet
of 10 ships.

"In the early 2010s, Elizabeth Holmes pretended that she had invented
a new technology to do blood tests, and used this pretend technology
to raise several hundred million dollars from gullible
investors.. Back in the 2010s this was all viewed as pretty noteworthy
stuff..

Now of course it is 2022 and we are all a bit more jaded. There was
the SoftBank boom, we've had a couple of years of SPACs, there is so
much crypto. Raising hundreds of millions of dollars from gullible
investors who don't do much due diligence is not particularly
impressive anymore. If you want to do it by pretending to have a
technology, you can (try electric vehicles!), but these days even that
is optional. 'In the past year, there has been a notable rush of
funding into the high-risk category of early-stage startups, as
investors have clamored to get into companies even before they had a
staff or product,' the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Or you
can raise lots of money from investors by letting them pretend to own
digital pictures of apes, or by just saying 'hey here's a Ponzi.?'
Theranos raised a lot of money from investors who did not do too much
due diligence, because the world was awash in money and investors got
careless; that is much, much, much, much more true now, and Theranos
looks a little quaint"

Obviously LPG needs to go (away). Do natgas -> H2 and produce "blue
H2". Use that in cars. If CCS at the source is done well (easy to
regulate) then the car can have no emissions. Use of renewable fuel at
the endpoint assures noone can cheat the way Volkswagen cheated with
diesel.

EPA: "Nearly all of the fuel carbon (99.5 percent) in LPG is converted
to CO2 during the combustion process. This conversion is relatively
independent of firing configuration"

[PDF](https://www3.epa.gov/ttnchie1/ap42/ch01/final/c01s05.pdf)

---

LPG is part buthane, part propane, both are products of natural gas.
As natgas became more prevalent such use of LPG must have become
feasible back when. I vaguely remember that transition, first noone
had natgas, then some for heating, then it was everywhere. It probably
helped to be the next door neighbor to the natgas export behemoth,
Russia, for TR. Import graph below.

Hah they use LPG in their cars too, same with many cars, esp cabbies
in Asia Minor. They used to put a freaking kitchen gas canister in
there, in the trunk during the 90s and jury-rig the engine to combust
LPG instead of petroleum (cheaper that way). To refuel, take old
canister, put another in. But the tech has developed now, cars can go
to a station and pump the gas in just like one does with petroleum.

"[Kazakhtan protests] began with something very concrete: the price of
liquified petroleum gas, or LPG, the fuel that many use to power their
cars. What caused the spike in LPG prices? It all began with the
phased transition to ..  allow the market to dictate prices instead
[of subsidies]... This policy has, predictably enough, led to a
particularly precipitous rise in costs where demand for this fuel is
high"

Ranked choice voting vs two-round system? With TRS candidates in the
1st round are only interested in getting more votes than the next
guy. If 10 people are running and 8 ppl get less than 10%, but one
person gets 12%, and the next best gets 11%, they are both in the next
round.

In such a setting candidates can choose appeal to very narrow
constituencies, and still win, then of course in the next round they'd
have to change their tune to appeal to more..  With RCV they'd have to
appeal to the broadest possible electorate from get-go, IMO that is a
good thing. Plus RC system is a money saver.

The *Foundation* series.. It was excellent. The arc for the Cleons was

Median is used instead of arihtmetic mean average precisely to ward
off the effect of extremes. It is used for wealth averages for the
same reason; otherwise people like Bezos would throw everything
off. Joe, Bob are in a room, they have 100,102 dollars, Bezos walks in
to the room, everyone there now is a billionaire, on average. Median
sorts the list and literally picks the person in the middle, in this
case the median wealth is $102. For home prices, that median is almost
half a *f-ing* million dollars.

---

The median home price itself is nearly half a million dollars
BTW.. For four walls and a roof.. There are amneties in it too sure,
but almost *half a million dollars worth*?

---

I remember some "boomer comedy" a while back complaining their kid
still has not left the house, still lives with them. Why not? Well
maybe bcz housing prices are too high. Prev generation outsourced,
killed wage growth, killed rates, and stock and real-estate prices
became inflated.. Now their kids dont believe in capitalism, who can
believe them?

---

0% instead of 2% mortage can offset a 30% rise of cost of a home in 15
years. But the price rise we see for homes for that period is over
60%, due to speculation.

---

Low rates can help mortgage rates be lower, but low irates also create
a speculative environment whereby investors rush to real estate assets
inflating prices there, which wld erase any gains home buyers might
have enjoyed due to low rates. Wasn't this at the root of the 2007/8
crisis?  They were selling houses to dead people for effs sake.

---

Reverse correlation is visible. We wee the brief 2018 rise in rates,
and housing prices falling.

---

Another reason why low interest rates are bad, it inflates house prices.
