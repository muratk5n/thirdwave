Paper: "Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising material for solid
hydrogen storage due to its superior hydrogen storage capacity... Our
results obtained by spin-polarized density functional theory
calculations with van der Waals corrections (DFT-D3) unveiled an
interesting “burst effect” during MgH2 dehydrogenation"

FT: "The big bet on hydrogen vehicles.. Toyota and Hyundai believe in the
alternative fuel.. Large vehicles, such as trucks, need an alternative
to battery electric power. The distances they travel mean electric
alternatives require heavy batteries.. for hydrogen-powered commercial
vehicles — buses and trucks — growth has been much stronger than
expected. Hyundai’s Xcient trucks have expanded market share rapidly
since last year, on the roads in Germany, Switzerland, New Zealand and
South Korea. Deliveries arrive in the US and Israel this year. In
China, hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle sales, led by buses, nearly tripled
last year"

It's true.. the sounds are truly a mess. The cacaphony is an
anti-propaganda for Islam the religion. Loud church bells are annoying
too BTW.

Quora: "I’m Muslim and I’ll tell you what I hate about [call to
prayer, Azan], (at least in major cities..)

VOLUME.

Mosques are located in just about every neighborhood and they all
blast the adhan at the loudest possible volume.

What results is an unintelligible, screaming, mess of sound, that
would be entirely unidentifiable as anything even slightly related to
a call to religious worship if it weren’t for blips of the rise and
fall of the familiar cadence that sometimes makes its way through the
mess because they all play at slightly different times, so the words
of each fight with those of the other"
