"Concentrated solar power (CSP) watchers are keeping an eye on Spain as
the country looks to auction a minimum of 200 MW of capacity before
2022.

Sara Aagesen, Spain?s Secretary of State for Energy, confirmed the
auction would go ahead before the end of this December in an
announcement on October 1"

Examples abound: your mother teaches you how to talk, to walk and how
to take a shit.  Then the economy takes this finished product, a
worker, utilizes them, makes money of off them. Noone pays the mother
for her labor.

This is the dirty little secret of the free market; that it relies on
a lot of free stuff.

---

The irony is tech relies on gov funded research from academia, and
other "free stuff" all the time.

High NG prices create an oppo for an H2 based solution

alternatives other than H2 for their furnaces.

Base info: Nordstream 2 can deliver 55 billion cubic meters of gas per
year. Natural gas contains 5367.27 kWh of energy per cubic meter of
gas.

Convert that to Gigawatts,

```python
kwh_year = 55*1e9 / 5367.27
print ("%0.2f" % (kwh_year / (365*24*1000)), 'GW')
```

```text
1.17 GW
```

The mega CSP plant in Chile has 110 MW capacity. That means roughly 10
of those plants will equal the Nordstream 2 pipeline. This is not bad
at all. Fantastic actually. Fossil f has been sitting there, basting,
for millions of years. But we can equal it with tech.

---

Nordstream 2 is still a major issue.. it's a huge amount of gas supply
into Europe. I wonder what the green equivalent to it would be

Taspinar: "There are some countries where a single issue can explain
pretty much everything that is wrong with its domestic and foreign

Strong reverse correlation.

I checked Granger causality, to see the direction of the cause from
the data, early time horizon FX effects current account. Later horizon
shows account effecting currency. So in a way it's a chicked-and-egg
problem, but from Nikolas MÃ¼ller-Plantenberg
[research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46490787_Balance_of_payments_accounting_and_exchange_rate_dynamics),
we know the primary direction is CA->FX. You need to have products to
sell so people demand your currency.

China is in similar power range to France. The large agro-empire past,
sometimes ending up as the odd-man-out in the Anglo world is similar
as well. 

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('../../2020/07/gdpw.csv')
df = df[df['country'].isin(['United States','France','China']) ]
df['gdp'] = df.gdpcap * df.population
df['mbindex'] = (df.gdpcap * df.gdp)/1e14
print (df[['country','mbindex']])
```

```text
          country       mbindex

Black brother in US are very different from an "African-African" in
culture. We know this.

Just like there are no "Irish" or "Polish" in US beyond zeroth
generation, there are no Turks in Anatolia, there are no Africans in
America -- unless brother jumped off the boat (plane) and came to US
obviously.
