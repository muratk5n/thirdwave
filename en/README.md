News from Egypt and Kenya: green hydrogen to solve fuel + food issues
all at once.. The new green hydrogen plan for Ain Sokhna in Egypt is a
case in point... The Sovereign Fund of Egypt is behind the project,
dubbed Egypt Green. So is ADNOC, the Abu Dhabi National Oil
Company. Other partners are Scatec for the renewable energy side and
OCI for nitrogen. Fertiglobe ( a branch of ADNOC and OCI) owns the
project and will operate it"

This show could degenerate into an NCIS, or Law and Order type ep
easily - fascist office show with occasional "knocking down doors"
scene. "Procedural". But the leaps takes the show into wildly
different settings, keeps things interesting.

Many dunk on 538 for their past failures but they are making raw data
available through simple URLs, that is great. The site is useful for
me.

That average is the result of an in-house recipe; gives weight to
indiidual polls according to recency, trustworthiness of the polling
company (why include them if they are not trustworthy), their
bias.. I've seen such approaches in analytics codes, they aren't
usually robust, I wanted to rock'n roll so went for the raw source
instead. Following indiv raw polls for race can expose trends, it can
give an idea.. It worked fine.

"Why did u look at individual polls rather than 538 average before midterms?"

Need to respect the cycle.. after low rates there needs to be a period
with higher rates.. Otherwise how will zombie companies go bust? There
are too many companies whose existence is questionable. Shopify, FTX,
Tesla, Carvana, Freshpet...
