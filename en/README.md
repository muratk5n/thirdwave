Oman has sunshine, has great access to the high seas. Perfect industry
for them. Export clean molecules to India, Europe, even Japan.

Party-pooper indeed..

On average reserves increased by 2.4% annually. Latest increase was
0.46%. Besides that new action offshore around Surinam we don't hear
any big news anymore on oil finds. The next Ghawar eludes all. 

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('oil-proved-reserves.csv')
df = df[df.Entity=='World'].set_index('Year')
print ('%',np.round(df['Oil - Proved reserves'].pct_change().mean()*100.0,2))
```

```text
% 2.4
```

---

For 2020 that number was 1,732 gboe, last number represent a modest
increase.

Oil and Gas Journal: "According to [our] annual assessment, the
world’s proved oil reserves total 1,724.5 billion bbl at yearend 2021"

---

What happens to the global price of crude they ask. Who cares? There
would b a US price, an EU price, so on..

---

And here we are discussing bleeping fossil again.. I ask for
CCS-enabled new refineries that can produce clean molecules.

---

Put the two and two together; US looking at refining capacity, has
crude.. Maybe US will simply stop exporting, refine its own oil and
release to the market, reintroducing the export ban? That'll get you
an additional 8 mb/d of oil pretty quick. US could essentially double
its supply of gasoline and halve the price.

---

"In 2021, the United States exported about 8.63 million barrels per day
(b/d) and imported about 8.47 million b/d of petroleum"

Bloomberg: "White House Eyes Restarting Idle Refineries to Tame Fuel Prices"

They didn't use their biggest bullet. You are thinking too globalist,
too free market.

Yahoo: "Gas prices have hit record highs but don't expect Biden to
lower them: 'They already used their biggest bullet' [meaning the use
of petroleum reserves]"

---

Not even June yet but already had a 'feels like 39 C' day.

---

This is not some Zen koan or ancient parable. It comes from
mathematical optimization. Optimizing algorithms look for global
minima (or maxima) all the time, and they always try not to get stuck
at "local solutions". 

---

In that case climb down, apply same technique in a different
direction, or try to see two steps ahead if possible; that is havine a
two-step plan instead of just one.

---

The one-step vs two-step solution issue is related to tactical
wins. Imagine being outside, during a fog, night time, how to reach
the top of a highest near hill? Simple solution - always move in the
uphill direction. Works remarkably well. Even if we lose long distance
vision, improving the current situation builds up in the long-run,
leads to global solution.

But, one can still get stuck on a "local minima". Because we didn't
look ahead, could have climbed the nearest *shorter* hill.

Didn't PM May say "no UK prime minister could ever agree" to an Irish
Sea border? Well there is one now. There is a customs border in the
Irish Sea. That means Brexiters broke the UK to 'deliver Brexit'. They
cut themselves off from the EU which forced them to cut UK into pieces

---

They haven't delivered shit. They swept the hard issues under the
carpet, ending up with worst of both worlds. Those issues are coming
back to bite them in the ass now.

"Current UK government delivered Brexit"

I saw the George Friedman 'rebuttal' to Kissinger. It's full of
generalities.. Countries that are... blah blah.. should not blah
blah. GF is good on collecting useful base info but can't deliver
the final analysis on current events all the time. 

---

Done well? Part of their country is *taken*. Over 6 million of the
country's citizens are now refugees. I dont think they are doing well.

"But Ukraine has done well so far"

---

Ukraine is not NATO. NATO-trained yes

---

Not true. NATO would be a formiddable foe against Russia, or anyone
who is dumb enough to take them on. Minus nukes, they'd wipe the floor
with any other power. With nukes involved obviously everyone loses.

"NATO would lose against Russia"

---

Massive electronic-warfare utilization, can have incoming missiles go
haywire. Increased target acquisition capab for later artillery
bombardment.. Can't fight this shit through proxy. Looks bad.

Business Insider: "[2/2022] At the tactical level, Russia's
non-contact warfare doctrine seeks to leverage drone spotters and
electronic warfare to locate enemy forces for destruction at standoff
distances using artillery without exposing tanks and infantry to
direct fire until the opposition is shattered"
