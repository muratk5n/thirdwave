Dude watches the moves of big dogs, checked companies shorted by
Burry, true, their P/FCF ratios are fukked.

P/FCF = Market Cap / Free Cash Flow. It is a measure of whether market
cap is justified by the cash flow a company generates. Checking Shopify,
comparing against Microsoft, Google


```python
import yf
atts = ["Market Cap (intraday)","Free Cash Flow"]
yf.get_disp("SHOP",atts)
yf.get_disp("MSFT",atts)
yf.get_disp("GOOG",atts)
```

```text
SHOP ['Market Cap (intraday): 181.07B', "Free Cash Flow: ('506,972', '382,963', '8,218')"]
MSFT ['Market Cap (intraday): 2.29T', "Free Cash Flow: ('56,118,000', '56,118,000', '45,234,000')"]
GOOG ['Market Cap (intraday): 1.84T', "Free Cash Flow: ('58,536,000', '42,843,000', '30,972,000')"]
```

Ratios

```python
print ('SHOP %d' % ((181*1e9) / (506.0*1e6)))
print ('MSFT %d' % ((2.29*1e12) / (56.0*1e9)))
print ('GOOG %d' % ((1.84*1e12) / (58.0*1e9)))
```

```text
SHOP 357
MSFT 40
GOOG 31
```

Shopify cap is 357 TIMES of its (trailing twelve month) cash
flow. You'd have to wait >300 YEARS to reach the market valuation of
this company with the cash it generates.

In comparison MSFT, GOOG have lower P/FCF, can generate cash.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
