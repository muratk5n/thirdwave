H2 View: "Three projects in Chile could double world electrolyser
capacity.. The Government organisation signed three agreements with
GNL Quintera, CAP SA, and Air Liquide, to develop the first
industry-scale green hydrogen production plants in Chile.

The three projects, set to launch in December 2025, are part of six
projects selected by Corfo in December 2021 and are hoped to bring
$1bn in investments and produce 45,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year"

H2 View: "Planned for Oman’s.. Free Zone, [a new] project will
integrate renewable power from solar, wind and storage; production of
hydrogen by electrolysis; production of nitrogen by air separation;
and production of green ammonia...

CEO at Air Products, said, 'We are delighted and honoured to work with
the government of Oman to develop this multibillion-dollar project,
which would be similar to the world-scale green hydrogen project we
are implementing with our partners in NEOM in the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia'"

Need to treat electricity like the plague. Play whack-a-mole with
it. Whenever it is generated, use it and make it go away; quash
it. Run it through an electrolyzer, produce H2, then send the gas over
the pipeline, done. Or convert to ammonia, ship it overseas on large
ships. The longer energy stays in this inefficient form, the worse it
is.

The grid 'cannot take it' because it is defective technology. Need to
transmit molecules (renewable gas), and convert to electricity as
required within cities. The crux of all storage, transmission, and
even end-use needs to be based on molecules. It will be more
[efficient](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EvdKNhvXAAE9Rr2?format=png&name=small)
that way. 

"We will bring more renewables online but the grid won't take it, so we
need to update the grid"

H2 Energy [Book](https://www.amazon.com/Hydrogen-Energy-Challenges-Solutions-Cleaner/dp/3030066657),
Zohouri: "The need to reduce CO2 emissions has pushed
towards creation of new 'clean' electricity production paths, such as
photovoltaic or wind power, with hydropower still in use. Although the
number of facilities has exploded mostly because of subsidies, these
facilities now allow for a significant production of renewable
electricity, which can reach more than 50% of total electricity
production, depending on the country and weather conditions.

Electricity production unfortunately has a major drawback:
variability. Mainly depends on meteorological conditions such as wind
and sunshine. Even if forecasts are fairly accurate, production maxima
do not always coincide with consumption, resulting in higher than
demand production; hence, there arises the need to be able to store
this excess electricity for later use, regardless of its form...

What technology should be used to store this excess electricity? The
first solution that comes to mind is batteries. Although some have
relatively large storage capacity, costs and limited lifetime do not
allow for large-scale use. Other solutions exist, but all are limited
in their storage capacity, compared to expected surpluses.

Apart from direct storage of electricity, the other approach is to
convert it into another form to be able to store it. This is where
electrolysis comes into play, i.e. conversion to hydrogen and oxygen,
hence the name power-to-gas"

If Brits did not force the partition in India creating Pakistan,
Afghanistan "problem" would perhaps be easier to handle; India would
have a border with Afghanistan instead of Pakistan, the "porous"
border between PAK and AFG (official look other way while fighters
come and go) could have been less of an issue. The Taliban insurgency
back then benefited hugely from that border, being next to Pakistan,
their intel services. It kept them alive, then one day as we all know
they came back. All thanks to Brits.
