Have to pick dried vegs carefully; beet root, dried mangold.. Carrots
are good for eyesight, but its high potassium is too relaxing, beets

Left Voice: "Everything You Need to Know About Sahra Wagenknecht’s
'Left Conservatism'.. Die Linke has a program calling for 'open
borders.'  Wagenknecht became convinced that this — and this alone —
was why her party was losing support in the East, where it was once a
Volkspartei, a mass party.. [Her book] is a 345-page diatribe against
what she calls 'identity politics' [that] 'amounts to focusing on ever
smaller and ever more bizarre minorities, each of which finds an
identity in some quirk which distinguishes it from the majority of
society, and from which it derives the claim to victimhood'"

"Die Linke politician [Wagenknecht].. is rumoured to be planning a
breakaway party.. In her bestselling book [.. she] accused Die Linke
of having neglected 'ordinary people' in favour of what she refers to
as a city-dwelling 'academic clientele'. She says its preoccupation
with issues such as 'gender-conscious language and pricey organic
products' rather than bread-and-butter issues such as 'fighting low
pay' has made it a stranger to its grassroots working-class support
base... Polls show her chances of succeeding as head of a new party to
be good... Among [right-wing] AfD voters the interest was a staggering
68%"
