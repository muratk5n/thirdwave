Not Even Wrong: "This morning Quanta Magazine informs us that
Physicists Create a Wormhole Using a Quantum Computer..  The two
senior physicists behind this, Joe Lykken and Maria Spiropulu, have
histories that go way back of successfully promoting to the press
nonsense about exotic space-time structures appearing in experiments
that have nothing to do with them... The claim that “Physicists Create
a Wormhole” is just complete bullshit, with the huge campaign to
mislead the public about this a disgrace, highly unhelpful for the
credibility of physics research in particular and science in general"

BTW gaseous plasmas cannot produce a Planck spectrum either, but we
see one for the Sun, so the Sun cannot be gaseous plasma. Cannot be
compressed, therefore cannot collapse into a black hole.

---

Penrose says when you plot CMB intensity against each frequency you
get Planck blackbody curve that means early universe must have had
thermal equilibrium. But thermal equilibrium means by definition
maximum random state... Wasn't the universe supposed to *toward*
disorder, and not start from one?

This kid had an interview with Cuck Todd being treated like finance
genius. How did that happen?

---

It was the same issue with Theranos, the board was stuffed with
connected people, outsiders assumed there is something good going
there.. Then bust. A few people in the circle failed to see, more
people rushed in. SBF father is a Stanford law professor, that weirdo
chick Ellison's parents were MIT econ connected to Gary Gennsler (of
SEC). People assumed FTX was legit because of its connections. They
assumed wrong.

For failure of detecting FTX fail look no further than
"connectedness".

China’s population is over 60, and the percentage is higher in rural
areas where health services are poor"

If voters were so smart, voted on policy and had a 20/20 vision into a
politician's ability, endorsements wouldn't have mattered. But they
do. If a popular politician is standing next to another politician the
popularity rubs off. That means [you](tweets/2021/you.png) the voter
cannot truly be in charge.

H2 Central: "Countries rich in hydrocarbons are among those that have
the greatest potential for meeting global clean hydrogen demand due to
existing infrastructure, says a new [McKinsey study](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/oil-and-gas/our-insights/the-clean-hydrogen-opportunity-for-hydrocarbon-rich-countries)"

"New Sulfur-Based Solar Reactor Makes Cheap Green Hydrogen.. Extracting
hydrogen from sulfuric acid with solar uses much less energy than
water electrolysis.. This SO2-depolarised electrolyzer only requires
about a seventh of the electrical energy of conventional water
electrolysis, so this method can produce about 50% more hydrogen with
the same solar input"

I never understood the itching for war mentality on the Ukranian side
vis-a-vis Russia. "The other side" of that potential conflict (which
became real) had an apparatus that readied itself for decades to go
toe-to-toe with another superpower. Even with reduced capacity
Russia's weapons manufacturing, supply lines, preparedness,
stockpiles, the whole thing would be at levels for much greater
conflict and all that preparedness would be dumped *on your head* if
you went to war with them, which is what Ukraine did.
