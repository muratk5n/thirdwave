"Kidnappings. Outbreaks. Earthquakes. The president assassinated — this
time in his bedroom.How is it possible, many ask, that Haiti shares an
island with the Dominican Republic, with its underground subway
system, health care coverage, public schools, teeming resorts and
impressive stretches of economic growth? Corruption is the usual
explanation..

[I]f Haiti had not been forced to pay its former slave masters, one
team of international scholars recently estimated, the country’s per
capita income in 2018 could have been almost six times as large —
about the same as in its next-door neighbor, the Dominican
Republic.They called the burden imposed on Haiti “perhaps the single
most odious sovereign debt in history.'"

The 'gun problem' cannot be fixed by simply harping about gun control.
'Guns are killing people, fix guns'. Nope. Centrist Dems starting with
Bill Clinton created a culture war around this issue, so one-step
solution will meet intense objection. But if all parties are
ideologically distinct, seperate and secure in their seperation
(dividers not uniters) then 5G issues will find easier agreement. We
know this can happen because it happened before; Reagan was for gun
control. Nixon founded the EPA. Two steps; fix ideology first, gun
agreement later.

The world is sufficiently fucked that one-step solution are no more
enough to fix problems. We cant fix the 'green energy problem' by
simply producing 'green electricity'. What will come after? How do you
transmit the energy? 'Well we just extend existing transmission lines'
(suboptimal). So the one step taken to make electricity 'green'
fails. Two-steps was needed not just one. First step; the energy
transmission mechanism changes, becomes gas based. Second step; Green
energy is produced, converted into green gas, using the new
transmission.

Paper: "The performance of high-yield bonds in the US domestic market
mirrors economic performance in the US overall. The yield spread of
high-yield debt over investment grade corporate bonds is more of a
function of the general outlook of the economy than of the health of
the issuing companies themselves, although the latter is obviously
important"

That won't happen; at worst their military takes over, as they've done
many times before, and they run the country along with its nukes.
Obviously a coup would be bad.

promise, Russian President Vladimir Putin toyed with the idea of

worsened over a looming food crisis due to the inability to export
Ukraine’s grain amid the conflict"
