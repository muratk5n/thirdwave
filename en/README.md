Fresh Prez of D.C. Russia Edition

It's likely he is precisely in jail bcz he could be an alternative,
i.e. the RU state actually could work with him. Either way in power he
cld be somewhat 'better' but I wouldn't expect a rosy character. Maybe
there would not be a Ukranian War Part II, but there wld be.. a Georgia?
A little Chechnia on the side?

---

Mind you, this is the opposition figure *in jail*.

The Atlantic: "[Navalny] supported Russia in its war against Georgia
in August 2008, using a derogatory term for Georgians in some of his
blog posts and calling for all Georgians to be expelled from
Russia. He has since apologized for using the racist epithet, but says
he stands by the other positions he took at that time"

---

Really? 

"Ew but things would be so much better with Aleksei Navalny"..

---

Remember the firebombing of Tokyo, that was executed through air
raids, planes dropping 2000 tons of bombs in 48 hours.

---

If total war starts and one of those gigantic Tupalevs start carpet
bombing cities you'll understand why. 

"Why does this No-Fly Zone matter anyway?"

---

Blinken reminds me of that gov official in *Under Siege*; in the
situation room one general leans over and tells him, if things go
wrong 'we'll just blame the cook' and he says 'absolutely'. That guy.

---

"People say 'well are you justifying [the Ukraine invasion]'... I say,
look if I see a child annoying a wasp, and the the wasps stings the
child, and I say to the child 'that was your stupid fault' am I
defending the wasp?"
