Heat pumps are better than pure electrical (resistance) heating as
they use some gas inside, also clean, but will still cause an uptick
in electricity usage.. Depending on the price of electricity in a
country that can hurt budgets. Everything about electricity, from its
delivery, to its storage, is problematic. If renewable gas is piped
into homes it can simply upgrade gas boilers to use the new gas,
instead of natgas.

The tools, the science of this domain is nowhere near being effective,
undeserving of the AI moniker (they are "preliminary weak AI" at
best), and they will not get better using the current methods being
deployed today.

Sounds like defunding the poh-lice

"[Berkeley] city council passed 'BerkDOT,' a first-in-the-nation
measure to shift traffic enforcement to unarmed Department of
Transportation workers. In the summer of 2020, cities across America
made similar commitments: to curtail the use of force, shrink police
budgets, and fund fleets of civilian officers. But Berkeley was the
first to target the traffic cop. By doing so, it is rethinking police
power at its root. Traffic stops are by far the most common reason
that police officers initiate contact with members of the public; they
account for 84 percent of encounters, according to data from the
Bureau of Justice Statistics. In fact, before cars, ordinary citizens
rarely came in contact with law enforcement. As we rebuilt cities
around the automobile, historians contend, drivers came to expect to
be policed. And communities of color have paid the highest price"
