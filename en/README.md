H2 Fuel News: "Green hydrogen-fuel plant starts production in
Spain.. The H2 facility was developed to produce power in cumulative
phases of 20 MW, 30 MW and 50 MW, until they reach a total of 100 MW
once the entire plant‚Äôs development is completed. It will have an
annual production capacity as large as 14,400 tons of H2, which will
be distributed by¬†hydrogen tank¬†truck and by injection into a hydro
pipeline. When it reaches full production, it is expected to prevent
over 12,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every month"

Start-ups or many estab players mostly dont pay for databases either;
Bigger players build their own DB software eventually but there is
Postgresql, and various other choices for all.

---

Before Linux, before open-source, commoditization, it would cost a
fortune to build a server farm.. I used to work in software
consulting, the price tag we gave to clients for a few commercial
machines with commercial OS, and databaes would make anyone's eyes pop
today.

---

It makes sense, they spend a pittance to make that money. Big tech's
top item costs are probably mostly talent and server farms. The
machines in those farms are nowadays commodity hardware and run a
variation of open-source Linux. Cheap and cheap.

Davis: "At present, most indicators, fundamentals of war, and current
battlefield trendlines support the prospect of a Ukrainian defeat...

In mid-April, Russia captured the critical transportation hub of Izyum
near the northern shoulder of the Donbas lines. Just days ago, after
nearly a two-month battle, Putin‚Äôs troops captured another key city in
northern Donbas that controls several essential road junctions in
Popasnaya. Kremlin forces have now pushed deeper into Severdonetsk,
putting Ukrainian troops at risk at Lysychansk, just to the southwest
of Severdonetsk...

Whether Putin has enough troops, ammunition, and time to complete the
destruction of the UAF positions in the Donbas without mobilizing some
portion of its reserve forces is an open question. What is clear,
however, is that Russia‚Äôs current operations are slowly strangling
Ukrainian troops in the Donbas and that despite optimistic rhetoric
out of Kyiv and Western capitals, the battle is trending towards a
Russian tactical success, possibly within two months...

Militarily speaking, there is very little hope that even all the
promised support of heavy weapons and ammunition from the West can be
delivered to the front, the Ukrainian troops adequately trained, and
firepower brought to bear in time to change the course...

By continuing to seek a military victory in Ukraine, Ukraine‚Äôs troops
will continue fighting, no negotiated settlement will be realistically
sought, and most likely Russian troops continue making progress. As a
result, more Ukrainian civilians and troops will continue to be killed
and wounded, more cities destroyed, and the economic and food crises ‚Äì
for both Ukraine and the world ‚Äì will worsen. The most likely outcome
will not change (a negotiated settlement, not a Ukrainian military
victory), but the cost to Kyiv will be much, much worse"

Arab News: "Marcos has been short on specifics about foreign policy,

South China Sea"
