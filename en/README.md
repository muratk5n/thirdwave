Sea surface has lots of potential.. That "hotspot" area on the Pacific, is at
roughly latitude -10.0 longitude -120.0, [map](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FCtt8adWEAEC8yi?format=png&name=small).
Floating panels? Ship green ammonia, H2 from there to South America, or to Japan.

"Hydrogen station network of up to 25 refuelling sites is set to be
developed across the UK by 2030 as a result of a new agreement inked..
between @bp and @DaimlerTruck"

There are only few places where intense solar exposure happens to fall
on land. Africa (Chad, Sudan), Southwest China, Saudi Arabia, and Oz.

Average solar radiation map 1990 -2004, shows which regions get
the most sunlight. Took it from McFarlane [presentation](https://youtu.be/gtmWGPaDkoI?t=367)

Prototech AS, a Norwegian company has solid NH3 know-how. Also Israeli
GenCell. Notable researchers on the subject, Bill David at Oxford,
D. MacFarlane at Oz Monash.

Rudolf Diesel, before he made diesel engines, made ammonia engines. It
almost became the shit

Same vid talks about an ammonia fuel-cell prototype

When we commit to a simple, efficient base chemistry, the options are
multiple.. Transport green ammonia, "crack it" to get H2. Or combust
it for turbines. Japan [has the technology](https://youtu.be/5ejL65tKsGM?t=107).

If carbon pricing can be made to work, how about "material usage
pricing"?  According to the rarity of materials used, price goes up or
down... Does it makes no sense to "go green" if the country of Chile,
or Bolivia gets destroyed [[1](2021/03/less-is-more-hickel.md#decouple), [2](2021/10/the-rare-metals-war.md)]
in the process?
