H2 Fuel News: "HyPoint predicts fuel cell aircraft with 4 times range
of conventional planes.. The company expects that this will occur
because of the ultra-light cryotank developed by GTL"

---

H2 View: "One solution [for H2 storage] that has been overlooked is
liquid organic hydrogen carriers.. LOHC are organic compounds that can
absorb and release hydrogen through chemical reactions... In
principle, every unsaturated compound (organic molecules with C-C
double or triple bonds) can take up hydrogen during hydrogenation..
One m¬≥ LOHC enables the safe storage of 57 kg H2"

---

H2 View: "France has recently announced a ‚Ç¨7bn package to build a
carbon-free hydrogen industry. Germany issued a similar program of
‚Ç¨9bn and that has intensified as their reliance on Russian gas is
threatened. In July, the European Commission said it is looking to
increase its production capacity of electrolysers from 250MW today to
40GW in 2030. Similar strategies have been released by the UK,
Australia, and Asian countries. These are just some of the most recent
announcements, but they show a clear trend towards massive public
investments in the sector"

---

Businesswire: "Locosoco pleased to announce discussions are underway
with Proton Technologies, a leader in the field of Clean Hydrogen
Production that utilises existing fossil fuel infrastructure.. Proton
Technologies [tech creates] carbon-free, low-cost opportunity for
extracting hydrogen using previously expensed infrastructure and known
energy deposits.. [which allows] extraction of clean hydrogen whilst
sequestering carbon within existing oil wells"

Not 'only' renewable energy; We could complement the transition with
CCS. Not a few Green parties are fine with blue H2 generated from
natgas with carbon capture (of course solar is preferable). People who
lobby, produce lit on this stuff need to laser focus on proper
engineering, and costs.

Report: "Greenhouse gas emissions need to be reduced by 43% and methane
by about a third by 2030 that can only happen if countries reduce
their dependence on fossil fuels and replace it with renewable energy"

WION: "United Nations warns that it's 'now or never' to avoid climate catastrophe"

---

Condemnation rituals.. Will that help? 

Maybe Japan should have just condemned Harry Truman for his war crimes
in Japan in 1945, instead of making a deal.

---

Maybe the play was an inner-outer battle again.. Abdullah's mother is
British - some say the only reason he got the job

---

Jordan is land-locked too except a tiny sea access. 

---

What was the aim for toppling Abdullah again? He wasn't for the accords?

I know Abdul is a Trekkie (had a cameo on Voyager) nothing particularly against him

---

Trump gone, he gone.

*Bourne Identity*, the first movie in the series, isn't exactly a post
9/11 movie. It was written, filmed 1999/2000, due to delays etc it hit
the theathers 2002. That is clear to see in the content; plus the
director Liman's father was Senate chief counsel on the Iran-Contra
affair, so he was making a movie around that stuff, shady biz,
underhanded spycraft etc.

*The Bourne Supremacy* is different, that's the true post 9/11
version. That movie has scenes JB beating up on black people (actually
strangles one), so proper message was sent to all fureigners,
A-rabs. Hey if Bond goes 9/11, Bourne has to do it too.

---

*Casino Royale* was a good action movie, no arguments there.

---

After much globetrotting adventures (an "outer belt" hero, the master
of all the New Lands) 9/11 Bond died near European landmass, while
fighting a Middle Eastern looking foe.

---

The 9/11 Bond, "James Blonde", has died. It's interesting the first
major action scene has Bond killing, beating on colored people in a
Caribbean setting. Post 9/11 Jason Bourne would soon follow suit.

Arabs aren't black but hey, close enough, they just found the nearest
non-white folk and beat up on them.

---

:) James Bond's grave at Faroe Islands

Spoiler: the last movie has Bond die there. The island now uses it as
touristic attraction.

The migration that resulted due to the partition was especially bad
with deaths reaching nearly a million. That too is on the Brits.

Al Jazeera: Before leaving India [1947], the British made sure a
united India would not be possible... East and West Pakistan were
hacked off the stooped shoulders of India by the departing
British.. Within months, India and Pakistan were embroiled in a war
over Kashmir, the consequences of which still affect us today. The
creation and perpetuation of Hindu-Muslim antagonism was the most
significant accomplishment of British imperial policy: the colonial
project of 'divide et impera' (divide and rule) fomented religious
antagonisms to facilitate continued imperial rule"

---

Kashmir? Britain's fault

---

It makes sense for Pak to get buddy-buddy w China, Russia; since India
rels are always on the rocks. Cant blame a guy for wanting friends,
energy deals, ports and roads for his country.
