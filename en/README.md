Paper: "Cost of long-distance energy transmission by different
carriers.. This paper compares the relative cost of long-distance,
large-scale energy transmission by electricity, gaseous, and liquid..
carriers. The results indicate that the cost of electrical
transmission per delivered MWh can be up to eight times higher than
for hydrogen pipelines"

H2 Central: "The government informed that the draft Hydrogen Mission
document has been prepared. In his Independence Day speech last year,
Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the launch of the National
Hydrogen Mission...

According to the [Minister of State for New and Renewable Energy] the
draft mission proposes a framework for demand creation, a basket of
measures to support production and utilisation of green hydrogen and
support for indigenous manufacturing.

Besides, it also includes research and development work, pilot
projects, enabling policies and regulations, and infrastructure
development"

The Australia Today: "In a research paper published in the prestigious
journal *Materials Today* [Deakin University researchers] have offered
a novel way to separate, store and transport huge amounts of hydrogen
gas safely and with almost no wastage..

The traditional oil refinery methods make up 15 per cent of the
world’s energy use [which] uses a high-energy ‘cryogenic distillation’
process to separate crude oil into different gases that are further
used by consumers as petrol and household gas.

IFM researchers in their papers have outlined a completely different
mechanochemical way of separating and storing gases that use a tiny
fraction of the energy and create zero waste...

The researchers say that the special ingredient in their process is
boron nitride powder"

H2 Central: "World's first vessel powered by an H2-storing salt gets
construction green light..The world’s first ship to be powered using a
solid form of hydrogen — said to be far safer and easier to store than
compressed or liquid H2 — is due to go into operational trials at the
Port of Amsterdam next June... The *Neo Orbis* passenger vessel —
designed to operate in Amsterdam’s canals and in the channel between
the city and the North Sea — will be powered by hydrogen released from
a salt called sodium borohydride (NaBH4)"

Newatlas: "EAT's silicon-based powder doesn't require you to start off
with any hydrogen at all – and getting the hydrogen back out is even
easier... The Si+ powder can be made using a (preferably renewable)
energy source, as well as metallurgical-grade silicon – which itself
can be made from sand, or from crushed-up recycled solar panels and
electronics. EAT's process results in a porous silicon powder that's
completely safe and easy to transport...

When you need the hydrogen, you dump the Si+ powder into water, mix it
around a bit, and ... that's pretty much it. At a wide range of
ambient temperatures between 0-80 °C (32-176 °F), hydrogen gas will
start bubbling out. The chemical equation, says EAT, looks like this:
Si + 2H2O -> SiO2 + 2H2. Thus, apart from the hydrogen gas, all that's
left over is silicon dioxide, also known as silica, or the major
constituent of sand"

Hyzon has good PR department; Kudos.

Tree Energy Solutions snagged Marco Alvera, the author of
[this book](2022/06/the-h2-revolution-alvera.html), prev CEO of
Snam. First project of TES is the Wilhelmshaven Green Energy Hub in
Germany, set to supply 250 TWh/year carbon-neutral energy of which H2
is a big part of. 250 TWh/y means 28 GW, not a small thing.

This level is pretty standard for most countries.. Electricity is already
not the preferred energy transfer medium. Suboptimal.

If latest GDP figure repeats before the next election, and net
popularity doesn't change it's a loss for Biden if he runs again. But
a mere -10% (an improvement) and GDP growth of 1% would give an
advantage to him, or to the "next Dem nominee".
