Storyline preference becomes clear around the issue of identity. They
usually portray AI as a unique, non-copyable thing... When it is
sent somewhere it ceases to exist at the source. Why? That's not how
software works!

The reason AI come alive story is used more in movies these days is
not bcz Holywood necessarily knows what the phuck is going on the tech
side.. They are basically repurposing the Pinoccio story for a new
domain. The "inanimate object coming alive" angle.. that's
all. Pinoccio for the good side, Frankenstein for the bad. Old story adapted
to something new, wout any change in semantics.

NYT: "Other People’s Rotten Jobs Are Bad for Them. And for You.. When
truck drivers are underpaid and overworked, it’s bad for them and also
bad for us.Researchers have found interesting connections between poor
working conditions and seemingly unrelated social problems. For
example, most people don’t think of the opioids crisis as a
labor-related issue, but research has shown a connection between
occupations with high workplace injury rates, like construction, and
opioid overdose fatalities. (People get injured on the job; lacking
sick days, they take opioids so they can work through the pain.)"
