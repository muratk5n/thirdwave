Daily News Hungary: "According to [Hungarian PM] Orb√°n, [RUS-UKR] war
could be around until 2030, and Ukraine could lose a third to even a
half of its territory. He was sure the war would have been local, but
the 'West stepped in, making it global', and now we are shooting
ourselves in the foot in Europe with sanctions. According to Orb√°n, 40
percent of European industry could shut down this winter because of
these sanctions"

All this arises in physical phenomena that is mathematically known
*completely*. Ain't that crazy?

There - we see a turbulent area but it is localized and there is a
certain pattern to its outer edges. Capture that, in most cases would
not be a need to know all of the internal details.

Turbulence, randomness.. how was randomness used? Calculating detailed
aero (to see all details of turbulence) is costly. With usual methods
one represents turbulence statistically, allowing controlled
randomness in the model, eg one says "I'll treat turbulent parts as a
blob, I dont care about the internal details of that blob but I'll
keep track of its location, maybe its size"... That could improve
calculations, turb is roughly accounted for, no need to process it in
detail, the rest of the computation in non-turbulent areas benefit
too.

CH has the hardware, manpower to establish a blockade, but can it
sustain it? Any sub can take a shot at the ships wout giving up their
country of origin. Any neighbor, or even US could try, once past
anti-sub defenses.

H2 Central: "Woodside and Japanese partners to conduct feasibility
study on establishing a lower-emissions fuel ammonia supply chain from
Australia to Japan...

In addition, the [JP] Sixth Strategic Energy Plan.. states that
ammonia-fueled power generation is one of the most promising options
for decarbonizing power sources toward achieving carbon neutrality by
2050 since it does not emit CO2 during combustion and can be utilized
in many existing power generation facilities such as boilers and
denitration facilities without modification.

Last year, Woodside, JOGMEC, Marubeni, Hokuriku Electric, and Kansai
Electric conducted a feasibility study on the entire supply chain,
including the production of lower emissions ammonia in Australia from
natural gas with CO2 abatement methods such as Carbon Capture and
Storage (CCS), Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU), and
biosequestration; marine transportation to Japan; ammonia‚Äôs
utilization as a fuel for power generation and marine use; and
financing"
