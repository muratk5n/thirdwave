H2 can do trucks, ships, airplanes.. And the solution that can handle
all cases, will displace one that can handle a few cases.

Great that Google shares GDELT files.. But is it AI? Sadly no. The
task is excruciatingly simple, look at a text, figure out who did what
to whom, where. Yet GDT fails in these tasks at times that are
laughable to a human... I look at the doc it clearly say attack was in
Libya. GDT assigns N. Syria. Attacker is IS, it says AFG, as in
gov. You know the shit is SOTA. It's Google! Their *main job* is
NLP. Yet SOTA aint good enough.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
