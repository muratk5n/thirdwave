H2 View: "Hydrogen blending success at Georgia, US, power
plant.. Hydrogen and natural gas blending in Georgia, US have been
successful at partial and full loads on an M501G natural gas turbine
at Georgia Power?s Plant McDonough-Atkinson in Smyrna"

H2 Central: "Gasunie ‚Äì Parallel Construction of Natural Gas and
Hydrogen Pipeline: Business as Usual.. [An engineer] Johan is
supervising the construction of a natural gas and a hydrogen pipeline
near Emmen.. 'The construction of these parallel pipelines is a first
for Gasunie: it is the first pipeline to be laid specifically for the
transmission of hydrogen. But ‚Äòwhether it‚Äôs a natural gas pipeline or
a hydrogen pipeline, the method of construction, the technology we
use, the material for the pipelines, it‚Äôs all exactly the same,' Johan
says matter-of-factly.

H2 based tech requires less rare earth. There are some likely tech
routes even that wld require zero. 

Pitron: "For example, there is 1,000 times less neodymium and 2,200
times less gallium than there is iron in the ground. The properties of
these metals make them essential resources for the [pure
electrification] energy transition. For instance, the engines of most
‚Äúzero-emission‚Äù cars and the rotors of offshore wind turbines are both
made of neodymium, a rare metal particularly prized for its magnetic
properties. Likewise, batteries of a large share of electric cars
could not be manufactured without resources such as cobalt, graphite,
or even lithium...

By seeking to break free from fossil fuels and create a new, greener
world, we are setting ourselves up for a new and more potent reliance
on China, which controls most of the production of rare and critical
metals"

The neighbors wanna do [this](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1cy61FHtjHKMNu_QI53cBZD3QhDUrNCkd)
to Qatar's reserves.

All that in little dinky Qatar.. The neighbors musta want a big bite
out of their NG reserves..

North Field.. Its reserves on discovery stood at 176 gboe, larger than
the largest oil field in the world, in terms of comparable raw energy (boe).

Al Monitor: "Qatar on Sunday named France's TotalEnergies as its first
foreign partner to expand the world's largest natural gas field and
eventually help ease Europe's energy fears... The French energy major
will spend an estimated $2 billion for a 6.25-percent share of the
giant North Field East project that will help Qatar increase its
liquefied natural gas (LNG) production by more than 60 percent by
2027, TotalEnergies chief executive Patrick Pouyanne told AFP.

F24: "Hundreds of people and several lawmakers protested Saturday in
southern Lebanon against Israel moving a gas production vessel into an
offshore field partly claimed by Beirut.The demonstration comes just
days before the US envoy mediating maritime border talks between the
two neighbours is expected in Lebanon, and after the ship operated by
London-listed Energean Plc arrived in the Karish gas field last week"

Stan pipelines go through Xinjiang, the Uygur region. \#ngmap

Two big pipelines projects from Russia into CH are under construction. \#ngmap

---

China has an intensive internal pipeline network, where are they
connected to / take gas from?  Eyeballing possible sources..  I see
some from "the Stans", but not much. A big source could be the LNG
terminals in the East, via ship. CH worries around its sea access
makes sense \#ngmap

---

Major pipeline proposed for Iran-Pakistan-India, due to sanctions it
delayed, India eventually gave up.. Sanctions are a tax on developing
countries \#ngmap

Nordstream 2.. The infamous project..  Earlier calc had bad data.. I
see 55 bcm/y now, more than a few Fukushimas worth. Huge amt of energy
\#ngmap

There isn't much going on betwen Japan and Russkie; they clearly do
not get along. Even before the Ukraine war, likely due to disputed
islands and other issues (inner/outer divide) their energy relation
was small. Japan gets oil via supertankers from Saudi Arabia, but not
ng via pipeline from neighboring Russia \#ngmap

---

The pipeline map.. The route around West Africa is nuts; It is between
Nigeria and Spain, but all the countries in between likely wanted a
cut, so little pieces go into all of them during transit \#ngmap

Er maybe like dont 'simulate' stuff?

Also let's not experiment on viruses so they "gain function"?

"Last year, current and former world leaders joined experts to conduct
a tabletop exercise simulating a deadly monkeypox outbreak"

Voltaire Net: "Israel now capable of striking Iran.. Israel is said to
have improved its F-35s, which have a range of 1,400 kilometers, so
that they can strike Iran"

At the very least AUKUS presentation was off. The group projected a
"running the world" vibe, an "Anglo" formation evoking the previous
(and current) imperial structures. Execution was off; Macron was
slighted, he took a dig in the AU PM later which became campaign
fodder and it hurt the libs at the polls. China too, made a move in
the Solomon islands, very publicly, and I believe speficially timed to
influence the Oz election because they felt attacked through the AUKUS
deal.

Might have even annoyed Russia; All of a sudden all your detractors
are up on a stage looking like the *pezzonovante* of the region,
seemingly gearing up to go after China, they'll think who is next?
