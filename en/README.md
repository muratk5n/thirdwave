*The Eagle*, there was enough criticism of imperialism, of Rome that
one can mentally skip over opression of distant locals (Brits!), and
the "heroes", can be seen as being about brothers in arms, ppl
fighting together, for something, even if that something was Rome, an
expansionist band of feudal cobsuckers.

Well written, directed, acted - five stars without a doubt.

Hand crafted code could have its own issues, but NN based approaches
are especially fragile, they are too dependent on data - data that is
curated for a specific purpose.

Yes BD control code is hand-crafted. Preferable than neural net based
"AI", at least they are trying to formulate an approach from ground
up, thinking about the problem, not blindly showing in data into a
black box.

Quora: "How does Boston Dynamics use AI/machine learning? For the most
part, it doesn't. Boston Dynamic's secret sauce is a “stack” of very
carefully hand-designed classic control laws... It's good because
classic control theory provides strong mathematical guarantees of
stability and performance, and this does not require *any*
“training”. It just works, right out of the box, assuming you get the
control design right.. Nobody has yet figured out how to apply machine
learning to robotic motor control in a practical way. Machine learning
takes far too much data, typically hundreds of thousands to millions
of trials. You can't collect that much data on a real robot. And
simulation isn't good enough, yet, for simulated data to transfer
without change onto real robotic hardware"

Bad smells coming out of Sweden; the Nobel Econ Prize is funded by
their Riksbank BTW, and the last one went to people who ardently
argued for "saving the banks".

Globalist conspiracy or just rotten ideology ran amok?

Werner, *Princes of the Yen*: "[C]entral bank independence alone does
not guarantee economic success of monetary policy. The Swedish
Riksbank, for instance, independently created a credit boom in the
1980s and a credit crunch in the 1990s. The U.S. central bank
leadership was not influenced by political pressure when it increased
credit creation steadily throughout the 1990s, thus creating a vast
asset bubble. The central banks of Thailand and Korea independently
encouraged their banks to lend excessively to the real estate sector
and independently set policies that encouraged their entire corporate
sectors to borrow from abroad, thus placing a precarious time bomb at
the heart of their economies"
