Forbes: "Angeles Link - by California utility SoCalGas, [will produce]
hydrogen from electricity generated by wind and solar power.. [Its]
infrastructure will include hundreds of miles of new pipelines
necessary to move the hydrogen to market... Once completed, the
company says the project will ‚Äúallow four natural gas plants and 20
percent of big diesel container trucks to convert to zero-emission
hydrogen fuel ‚Äì with the potential to reduce diesel fuel use by as
much as 3 million gallons per day in California.‚Äù  SoCalGas also
estimates that its new green hydrogen pipeline system will deliver the
clean energy equivalent of almost 25 percent of the natural gas
delivered by SoCalGas today"

H2 View: "German green energy hub central to overcoming European
energy crisis..[TES Chief Commercial Officer Otto Waterlander:
Production] will increase to 250 TWh per year and more than five
million metric tons of hydrogen in a final stage. The green hydrogen
will be produced using exclusively renewable sources, mainly solar and
in several cases, wind and/or hydroelectricity.'"

H2 View: "Morocco seeks to establish a gas infrastructure worthy of
the 21st century, said minister.. Le√Øla Benali... Morocco is also
called upon to become a leader in competitive hydrogen, said
Ms. Benali, stressing the importance of the gas infrastructure of the
21st century ‚Äúwhich can allow us to mix hydrogen like the countries
which mix in existing gas pipelines 30 pc of hydrogen.‚Äù

Houston Chronicle: "Texas companies embrace hydrogen to retain energy
crown.. The world is determined to move away from burning fossil
fuels, but Houston could remain the energy capital of the world thanks
to a coalition of Texas businesses and nonprofits betting on hydrogen
helping the city retain the crown. The gamble is sound. Climate
activists agree that hydrogen molecules in either gas or liquid form
will help replace oil, natural gas and coal"

Some versions of HS missiles dont even have explosives - just sheer
kinetic energy; a mass of metal crushing into something else at Mach 5
speed or greater. Simple, fundamental works; mass, speed, pressure,
heat.

---

Hypersonics can be a big problem for ships.. I dont think a swarm of
HS can be stopped, they could potentially take out an aircraft carrier
if attacker knows where they are. With high-res satellite imaging
pinpointing a fleet could be possible too. Then during a war
satellites become a target. Enter Space Force. It goes on and on.

I hear there are some engine issues though..

J-20 is CH next-gen combat fighter plane. I dont think it can take on
F-35s, esp F-22s one-on-one, but I believe they designed this
thing with "a certain mission" in mind. It has long range.

power as competition for resources heats up."

Mapping software Leaflet is great, but it needs backend
connectivity. That spiffy dynamic zoom-in feature doesn't work by
magic..  It gets additional data as needed from a server to make that
happen.

IoT is a foolish new "industry", just like Pok√©mon Go, 3D TVs, or
battery-electric cars. Less connectivity is needed not more.  Aim for
offline, standalone, intermittent.

That's still about same as the Texas landmass. Not bad.

Oz Economist Saul Eslake \#ABC: "Schemes that allow people to pay more
for housing than they otherwise would, will result in more expensive
housing, rather than more people owning housing. I dont think it's any
coincidence home ownership rate has been declining ever since the
first census after the first homeowner's grant was introduced by the
Menzies government in 1964.. The reality that all politicians are
aware of is that there is at least 11 million voters who own at least
one property, within that there are at least two million who own two
or more, and of course those voters want governments to keep doing
things that push house prices up... [the latest gov proposal] is yet
another example of that kind of scheme"
