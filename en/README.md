Yahoo! News: "If she filled out and submitted a [req for permission],
Biles was covered to continue taking Ritalin in Tokyo without fear of
arrest. So while it's impossible to determine what has causedÂ Biles'
[drop out..] a lack of medication is almost certainly not to blame"

Temp 34 feels like 39, humidity 49%. Yep.

Absolutely, Cuba has a ruling elite.

Second Wave, whether w capitalism or communism, has [Integrators](2011/03/integrators.md).

---

All this "displacing the elite" talk is usually a ruse, the elite is
not displaced but merely *replaced* by -wait or it- another elite. It
cant work any differently within the context of modernity (second
wave)

"Trump as populist bcz he does what ppl want"???  What the hell u
talking abt? DT was like a self-proclaimed king! He knew everything

Many things can be tied to self interest. Do we want ppl walking
around coughing up a lung from treatable ilness, going bankrupt from
med debt so they start breaking into ur house for money? You come back
home and find some asshole trying to jimmy the lock. I'll drop kick
the motherfucker.. and I dont want to be in that position. I want
single-payer so desparation is reduced. M4A is smart policy (also
costs less).

One thing Trump's endorsement isn't doing so far in 2021: helping his
chosen candidates raise money. Between Susan Wright (R) in #TX06 and
Mike Carey (R) in #OH15, his candidates are getting significantly
outspent"

Yeah Maradona could run circles around 7 guys and score, but how many
times can you pull that shit off?

Football utilizes many of the greater-sum concepts these days; pay
attn to how players pass eachother, there is a certain pattern, there
are triangles, they advance through little passes, piece by piece,
which can build up to a GOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLL!!!!!

Hah they are both Argentinian, good question.

I'd say Messi comes out on top. Maradona was great but he was also a
"flash in the pan" in many ways, he'd shine one game, than nothing for
many others... Messi is a professional. Delivers solid performance in
every game. Team player.

"How does Messi measure up to Maradona?"

Where did I get that UNICEF number: "every day 19,000 children die
from preventable causes"? I saw it on a commercial with football
player Messi.

Guy has a mad hatter look to him too. Is he getting pulled toward the
Cuck Side?

---

Some say Feige is behind the kerkuffle.. He did well with the MCU
pre-2020, but the new crop of stuff don't look so good..

---

IMO the movie was a dud

"Disney is sued over streaming of Black Widow"

Minorities, cultures, assimilation... let me put it this way.  US has
10% of its population with Irish ancestry. This probably translated
into its cultural make-up, so let's say 10% of US is culturally
Irish. This means EVERYONE in US including the so-called "Irish
people". They are not 100% Irish, they are also 10%. This might bother
some, u thought you were "special", "ethnic", but you are another boring
citizen.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
