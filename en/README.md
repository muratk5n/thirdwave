The irony is he might be safer in that cell than out in the streets of
Berlin.

Brutal

"Navalny says he is forced to watch eight hours of state TV a
day... tells of brainwashing and propaganda in jail..  Navalny has
given his first interview from prison, comparing it to a Chinese labor
camp and saying he is forced to watch eight hours of state television
a day"

"US approves potential sale to Australia of services for SM-6 and SM-2 IIIC missiles"

---

One docu said UFOs "really like nuclear missile sites", as in always
visit them.. Plots dont show that correlation.

---

Unless..  aliens love airbases 

---

For significant states (higher sighitings compared to population), we
calculate sightings midpoint, checked two, Idaho and Arizona, both
have airbases nearby. Weakens alien hypothesis somewhat

Am a big fan of cauliflower.. 

"Eat more plants: To reduce your riskÂ of cardiovascular disease and
diabetes, try to have every meal include at least one plant-based
dish. I typically have broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus or zucchini as
a side for lunch and dinner...

Avoid processed foods:Â Many products you find in grocery stores today
are loaded with salt, sugar, saturated fats and chemical
preservatives. AÂ 2019 studyÂ of 20,000 men and women aged 21 to 90
found that a diet high in processed foods resulted in an 18% increased
risk of death by all causes"

If it is the latter obviously US is not going to 'reinvade' bcz of an
attack. But they can make WH look bad, trying to reinforce a "botched
pullout" narrative.

---

AFG attack: somebody is giving somebody a message.. About delaying the
final pullout date perhaps (tho US had already rejected that)? Or
war-hawk neocon tools stirring shit up? Who the phuck knows.. Sad.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
