Whodunit? Sadr is the big Shite honcho. He condemned the attacks, who
is left? 

I read al-Kadhimi played a role in the killing of Soleimani.

"Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi escaped unharmed in an
assassination attempt by armed drone... It came two days after violent
clashes in Baghdad between government forces and supporters of
Iran-backed political parties, most of which have armed wings, since
those groups lost dozens of seats in parliament after a general
election on Oct. 10...

Shi’ite Muslim cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose party was the biggest
winner in last month’s election, calling the attack a terrorist act"

on Thursday amid a spike in the number of unvaccinated COVID-19

CNBC: "Travel stocks rally, stay-at-home companies plunge as pandemic

could cut hospitalization risk or death by 89%, and the U.S. prepares

public, and his rights are being trampled on -- he cannot walk on a
sidewalk when someone plants an entire campground in his way.

"But it is public space! We cannot disallow the public from living there"

LA Times: "The city of Los Angeles has undertaken a major shift in its
approach to homelessness, one that puts a priority on clearing
unsightly street encampments"

Now the big question: Carbon or methane? Which one causes more
warming? Looked at that too, [here](2015/08/temp-increase.md#ch4co2).

---

Graph was flat for a while but then it shot up again starting 2005.
That must be the so-called "US Shale Revolution". Natural gas
production skyrocketed in US, and so the leaks, flaring, etc. 

---

What are those little bumps? That is probably methane of decades
earlier disappearing (methane can expire much earlier than
carbon). But we keep putting more in, so the trend is always up.
