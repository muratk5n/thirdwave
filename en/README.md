"@CAHydrogen

Renewable, clean #hydrogen would allow for jobs in the fossil fuel
sector to transition to a clean energy economy, and be retained,
creating support from those union and trade groups, says Senator
@NancySkinnerCA"

As gas, underground pipe storage. Salt caverns. Lining a rock cavern
with a thin layer of steel are all possible technologies. There is ammonia.
[There are](2022/06/the-h2-revolution-alvera.md#storage)
many options. 

"In a statement GenH2 asked, 'How will.. hydrogen be stored at these
new hubs?'

H2 View: "Cummins announced that it has joined the Hydrogen Engine
Alliance, an initiative bringing together European industry

H2 Fuel News: "India aims for cheaper green hydrogen to accelerate its
use.. India wants the World Bank and other global funders to establish
guarantee programs to assist in making low-rate funds accessible, said
Kant. The goal is to reduce the cost of transitioning to – and using –
renewable H2, particularly in sectors where decarbonization is
difficult, such as fertilizer manufacturing, steel production and
refineries"

CCS at the source is much easier to regulate, gov would be checking a
few, large installations.

VW now like battery-electric cars, these people clearly alternate
between being a crook and a moron; but the energy infra should not
give them a chance to be either. Clean molecules, in storage, in
tranmission, and in consumption can achieve that.

---

The longer fossil stays in the system, stored, transmitted, the more
the chances are for "leaking or cheating". If oil pipeline breaks it
causes environmental damage. If fossil allowed in cars with 'emission
control' instituted, it will lead to cheating as in Volkswagen's case. 

---

They can have their cake and eat it. Generate 'blue' H2 and pipeline
it to customers. Clean, after CCS at the source can have no emissions
down the line, including the end-user. 

The Guardian: "Ex-UN climate envoy says continent’s need for energy is
so great it should be able to widely use the fossil fuel. African
countries should be able to exploit their vast natural gas reserves
despite the urgent need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions, the
former UN climate envoy Mary Robinson has said"

I like the name; GREEN STEEL

H2 Green Steel: "Steel production accounts for 25 percent of Europe’s
industrial CO2 emissions, which is more than the Nordics’ total CO2
emissions, or more than all flights departing from the
EU. Decarbonization is a must for the industry and disruptive
technology will be a key enabler..

So, how does it all work? In traditional steel making, reduction of
iron ore is done by heating it together with coal, utilizing a
chemical reaction that separates the oxygen from the iron, forming and
emitting CO2. In our production, green hydrogen reacts with iron ore
similarly to carbon, resulting in the extraction of oxygen. But
instead of creating CO2, the main by-product is H2O.

Large-scale green hydrogen production will enable the transition of
hard-to-abate industries towards sustainable operations. And as a
front-runner, H2 Green Steel will play an important part in
accelerating decarbonization"

Ukraine complains about Germany denying them NATO entry '08. But then
they continued to increase NATO relationship, train with them as if
they will *definitely* join at some point.. Were they waiting for the

Isn't that such a big bet, on your country's security, that it might,
could, maybe one day happen?
