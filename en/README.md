Bloomberg: "How Changing Diets Leave Us Exposed to War, Extreme
Weather and Market Turbulence.. The convergence of global diets means
just three crops provide 50% of the world’s calories. When shocks
come, they hurt.. Bagels in New York. Cakes in Beijing. Instant
noodles in Jakarta. Daily habits for billions, yet just a generation
or so ago Indonesians would have likely reached for a bowl of rice or
the Chinese a sweet potato.

A combination of rising incomes, the impact of Western culture and
industrial farming focused on specific crops means we are all eating
increasingly alike. And that means more of us than ever depend on
imported food. Wheat, now an integral part of most diets, is produced
predominantly by just a handful of countries. When Russia’s invasion
of Ukraine disrupted trade, global prices spiked almost 40%...Of the
6,000 plant species humans have eaten over time, the world now mostly
eats nine, of which just three — rice, wheat and maize — provide 50%
of all calories"
