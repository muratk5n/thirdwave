Geek Wire: "Seattle-based First Mode and the Anglo American mining
company have signed a binding agreement to combine First Mode with
Anglo American’s nuGen effort to develop a [H2 based] zero-emission
system for hauling ore.

The transaction, which is expected to close next month, values the
newly combined business at around $1.5 billion and includes a 200
million equity injection from Anglo American...

First Mode is an engineering company that initially focused on
providing expertise for space projects such as NASA’s Perseverance
rover mission and the Psyche mission to a metal-rich asteroid. But in
recent years, it’s devoted increasing attention to carbon-reduction
technologies for heavy industry.

The company provided the hydrogen-fueled hybrid power plant for Anglo
American’s nuGen mining truck, which made its debut in South Africa
this year as the world’s largest zero-emission vehicle."

"Putin fell down the stairs"? Was it the real Putin or the
body-double?  How do they know?

They get most of this stuff from anti-Kremlin Telegram channels, the
media has zero ability to check the validity of the news. They are
merely shuffling hearsay.

Canadian Greens need a little disrupting. They are copying 2010s Dem
shitlib playbook - being audacious on hopeful sounding shit. If it
audacious it's a sign you must grind it. The more fundamentally
retarded the better; that makes that path more audacious. Sprinkle a
little 'grassroots imploration' to cover your ass, you are done.
Politics of the future my friend.

"@wyldcdn

Seriously Canada!!!! 60+ companies working on hydrogen in Canada.  One
of them is basically the company that kickstarted this. They are all
as good as it gets.  What do our 'greens' push for?  Dirty foreign
batteries and even dirtier infrastructure"
