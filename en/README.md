H2 Fuel News: "Aramco and [Thai energy company] PTT team up on green
and blue hydrogen"

---

H2 View: "Australian energy company, Woodside, announced that it has
officially changed its name to Woodside Energy Group Ltd. Previously
Woodside Petroleum Ltd., the name change reflects the company‚Äôs recent
sustainable efforts, with significant ventures into green hydrogen"

---

H2 View: "Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners (CIP) have announced a
proposal to build a dedicated artificial island in the North Sea, for
large-scale green hydrogen production, called ‚ÄòBrint√∏‚Äô. Brint√∏, Danish
for ‚ÄòHydrogen Island‚Äô, would provide a significant contribution
towards Denmark‚Äôs ambitious hydrogen strategy, with its ability to
supply up to 1 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year once at full
capacity of 10GW..

CIP have suggested that Brint√∏ could be operational by 2030, and could
prove to be a vital step in securing green energy supply for
Europe. The hydrogen produced via Power-to-X will use offshore wind
electricity and will be hoped to be exported to countries such as,
Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium using pipelines"

H2 Fuel News: "Alstom, PKN ORLEN sign agreement to introduce hydrogen
trains and infrastructure to Poland"

---

H2 View: "Six African countries formerly launched the Africa Green
Hydrogen Alliance, which aims to make the continent a frontrunner in
the green hydrogen development race. The Alliance, formed by Kenya,
South Africa, Namibia, Egypt, Morocco, and Mauritania, intend to
accelerate the transition from fossil fuels, which hopes to open
access to clean and affordable energy supplies"

---

H2 View: "Germany, Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands partner to
generate 20GW of green hydrogen in the North Sea by 2030"

---

H2 View: "Renault to relaunch its Scenic with hydrogen powertrain"

---

Their combustion engine is "robust to hydrogen fuel
impurities". Spread of this tech will increase options for transport;
can get fuel through ammonia, LH2, LOHC, as well as pipeline, CH2...

H2 View: "Cummins: We need decarbonisation solutions for the mobility
industry, and hydrogen internal combustion engines are a practical
option. Hydrogen engines are a breakthrough technology essential to
reaching Destination Zero. They are low cost, highly efficient,
perform like diesel in aggressive duty cycles, are robust to hydrogen
fuel impurities, are durable in extreme operating environments, and
are versatile"

---

Clearly their products is based on alkaline fuel-cell tech, which
means it will not need high-purity H2 to function. Their target is
customers who need renewable gas based heating which is potentially
huge.

H2 View: "Alkaline Fuel Cell Power achieves first major millstone for
innovative hydrogen technology.. [and] is now believed to be working
to towards commercialising a 4kW micro-combined heat and power
(Micro-CHP) system. The.. system could be a major technology for the
hydrogen industry and is a crucial step in the creation of the
Company‚Äôs manufacturing capabilities"

How strawberries lose mass after dehyd never ceases to amaze..  1 kilo
of the stuff, gone, down to mere dried slice. Where did it all go?
Strawb is 91% water. That's where..

That is genius; put all ingredients in raw, then the whole thing is
cooked as closed, that cooking kill germs inside, and can be sure no
more will enter until the can is opened.

"Canned chicken is pressure cooked right in the can in a process called
retort cooking".
