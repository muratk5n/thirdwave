Frigate.. for anti-sub work surely

Is *Starship Troopers* satire..? In parts, yes.. It starts out with
some post-Vietnam, anti-war feel. But it ends with a World War II
bruhaha, ie *Band of Brothers* jive.. By the end, the viewer will feel
happy the way the heroes moved up the ranks, former drill sargeant
saluting his student, a "brain bug" having been cought and more "ass
kicking" on the way.

```python
import yf
r1 = yf.get_financials("AMZN")
r2 = yf.get_financials("MSFT")
r1["Enterprise Value/EBITDA"], r2["Enterprise Value/EBITDA"]
```

```text
Out[1]: ('28.67', '25.90')
```

Enterprise Value/EBITDA values over 10 indicates bubble, no?

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
