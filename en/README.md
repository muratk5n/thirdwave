It's an ambargo right, not a *blockade*, on Cuba. They can still buy

Right; theoretically you need more money to cover a company's debt,
but its cash would now belong to you (subtract).

"[EV is calculated by] multiplying the company's outstanding shares by
the current market price of one share [market cap, .. to] this number,
add the company's total long-term and short-term debt. Lastly,
subtract the company's cash and cash equivalents.. This result shows
how much money would be needed to buy an entire company. The
enterprise value calculates the theoretical takeover price one company
would need to pay to acquire another company."

"Zoom school" is no good. Ed can be based on prerecorded lecture
videos. The approaches are different. In one there is an average
quality jackass waving his arms online, syncronized, in the other
there is animation-augmented high quality content/teacher potentially
teaching millions, asynchronized, offline. Priority should be
low-income kids wout access to quality education.

The multimillion dollar campaign to keep Democrat Nina Turner out of
the House, punctuated by the No. 3 Democrat in the chamber campaigning
against her this weekend, has been a bit much. There's a better way

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
