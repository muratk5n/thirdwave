"Influential analyst [Michael Liebreich] says the world will not be
able to produce renewable energy fast enough to decarbonise hydrogen,
power, steel, transport and heating at the same time. 'We have to
learn to love blue hydrogen. Maybe in an ideal world, we wouldnâ€™t, but
we do,.. meeting the coming demand from sectors that would almost
certainly need clean H2 to decarbonise, such as steel, shipping and
long-term energy storage â€” would require five times the current
installed global wind and solar capacity"

For countries, esp. developing, focusing on Coal-H2+CCS route wld make
sense; most countries have coal, no problem securing supply. Can scale
output up and down wout being restricted by land availability,
panels. The rest would be perfecting the chemistry, optimizing
industrial processes.

Asked a prof if coal-methane then H2 is doable, says coal-syngas is
easier.

"[T]hrough gasification (H2 + CO), then water gas shift
(H2O + CO --> H2 + CO2) so then what you have at the end is H2 + CO2.
You can either capture the CO2 with an amine leaving H2 with some CO2 in it,
or you use pressure swing adsorption to capture H2 at high purity, leaving
CO2 with H2 in it"

Holy Coal. China uses a lot of coal. The digging on those mines would
be at insane levels.

Let's remember the numbers, Nordstream is 65 GW each, Fukushima (was)
5 GW, the largest solar plant is 2.25GW, 1 GW is considered quite
large for solar, Ghawar oil field output is 269 GIGAWATTS.

---

China consumes a whopping 4998 GW, nearly twice as US does at this
point; makes sense for the world's manufacturer. India has a lot of
people. Japan's usage pretty low for a country its size, I'm guessing
due to energy savings... Germany is at 400 Gigawatts.

Energy (all energy) consumption per country (in GW)

Annual TWh consumption is divided by 365*24, gives wattage

I search "coal consumption percentage of energy in germany" Google
answers "As of 2020, around 24% of the **electricity** in the country
is generated from coal." - Bold font is mine.

ELECTRICITY DOES NOT EQUAL ALL ENERGY

Wind and solar is about 6% of their energy consumption

I dont think that's true... Checking the BP file

"Germany generates half of its energy through renewables"

---

Producer can send clean fuel over pipes, if natgas is sent it is
converted at the receiving end.

Ammonia is sent via ship, if LNG is used, a plant at the port does the
conversion. #H2

---

In terms of clean energy transition (not necessarily exclusively
renewables based) priority-wise my vote is going gung-ho on blue H2
(indicating CCUS). Let's convert every bit of CH4 (natgas) into H2
whereever possible.

---

The new CEO is somewhat less for electrification (good), talks abt
e-fuels though that mechanism is tough to streamline.. E-fuels are
synthetic fuels which use carbon through budgeting schemes that makes
fuel 'carbon neutral' (car remains unchanged). 

Let's not forget how these muckers cheated with their emissions before.

I saw vids of chefs making the pizza and while they add the sauce they
only referenced the tomatoes, sometimes where they are from, but that
was it.

---

There

"Whereas the pizza sauce I lazily pick up from Trader Joeâ€™s
refrigerator section [is..] loaded with spices, the pizzas in Italy
had very fresh tasting sauce, without much else in them. Could it
really as simple as using crushed tomatoes alone? After a bit more
research, I found that my suspicion was correct"

The sauce is only tomatoes looks like, nothing crazy.
