Instead of making itself a target in a possible nuclear exchange gov
signaled nuclear neutrality - makes sense for them.

The Guardian: "While Australia was yet to actually join the Treaty on
the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, the shift in its voting position
to “abstain” after five years of “no” is seen by campaigners as a sign
of progress given the former Coalition government repeatedly sided
with the United States against it... [The treaty] imposes a blanket
ban on developing, testing, stockpiling, using or threatening to use
nuclear weapons – or helping other countries to carry out such
activities"

Good/bad acting aside I'm talking about being a fit. An actor is in
some ways a prop on a movie set... Certain base look, and a certain
range of acting makes the actor either a good prop or a bad prop for
certain movie. 19th century period piece needs 19th century props, a
flimsy person role can require a flimsy looking actor. Can Hugh Grant
play Jessup on *A Few Good Men*, or Christopher Walken Neo on *The
Matrix*?
