Fuels..  Utilizing [Georgia Tech] MAPS technology with renewable
energy to produce cost effective green ammonia.. along with Kontak‘s
technology, which Hydrofuel has previously acquired.. [will] allow
Hydrofuel to produce Green NH3.. for as low as $220 a tonne, whereas
fossil-fuel derived NH3 is currently selling at 1,500 to 2,000 dollars

Making the case for nuclear with "we'll build smaller reactors" is not
a strong argument. What's the difference btw four small reactors
costing 250 mil each instead of one that costs 1 billion (w power
output equaling four plants)?  But a new type of reactor using
different fission material can fly. That would be a new argument.

Lookit; Asia Minor is 4th in the list of Th estimated abundance;
344,000 tons.

"Thorium is three to five times more abundant than uranium in the
earth's crust..  produces less radiotoxicity than the U02 because it
produces fewer amounts of actinides, reducing the radiotoxicity of
long life nuclear waste. Th02 has higher corrosion resistance than
U02, besides being chemically stable due to their low water
solubility. The burning of Pu in a reactor based in thorium also
decreases the inventories of Pu from the current fuel cycles,
resulting in lower risks of material diversion for use in nuclear
weapons"

Wiki: "The discharged wastes are mostly fission products (nuclear
ashes) with shorter half-lives. This reduces the needed geologic
containment to 300 years rather than the tens of thousands of years
needed by a light-water reactor's spent nuclear fuel"

Wiki: "A molten salt reactor (MSR) is a class of nuclear fission
reactor in which the primary nuclear reactor coolant and/or the fuel
is a molten salt mixture... 1960's Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment
aimed to prove the concept of a nuclear power plant which implements a
thorium fuel cycle in a breeder reactor. Increased research into
Generation IV reactor designs began to renew interest in the
technology, with multiple nations having projects and, as of September
2021, China is on the verge of starting its TMSR-LF1 thorium MSR..

A further key characteristic of MSRs is operating temperatures of
around 700 °C (1,292 °F), significantly higher than traditional LWRs
at around 300 °C (572 °F).. economical hydrogen production."

Terrestrial Energy is a nuke energy play. But these guys do a
different kind of fission, "Generation IV molten salt fission
technology". Can use thorium instead of uranium. Th more abundant, has
better waste management features.

If we were to adjust for the water loss, pineapple is 87% water, 47.8 * (100/13.) = 367 mg.
Of that 300 mg was preserved, ~82% Vit C remained after dehyd. Not bad..

The optimal temp was 50 deg Celcius. 

---

Pineapple has 47.8 mg VitC, looks like drying "increased" vitamin
C. But they dried, collected 100 g sample of dried pineapple, in that,
vitamin C was 300 mg.

---

Paper finds 300 mg / 100g of Vit C preserved in pineapple fruit after
drying..

Of course.. there is pickling of nearly everything else; why not eggs?

Many cultures around the world marinate hard-boiled eggs -- like
pickled eggs in Europe or tea- and soy-infused eggs from Asia. These
delicacies offer a fun (and tasty) way to demonstrate the concept of

That is correct.. And a great way to teach / prove the former is with
