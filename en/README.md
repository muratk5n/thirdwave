Experiment generated 70% of what it put in. Awaiting for higher Q.

Wikipedia: "The condition of Q = 1, when the power being released by
the fusion reactions is equal to the required heating power, is
referred to as breakeven"

Mujahideen were the good guys then (remember *Rambo 3*), some of whom
formed the Taliban later.

*Charlie Wilson's War*'s message was about US "leaving" Afghanistan in
1989 after the Soviets left and not reforming the country.. Well-meaning
thought.. except US **didn't** leave. They [stayed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/27/10-myths-about-afghanistan)
and continued stirring things up, helping entrench the civil war there between
mujahideen and the central government.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
