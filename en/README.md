H2 Fuel News: "Air Products has announced that it will be building and
operating its own 10 metric ton [per day] green liquid hydrogen fuel
production facility in Casa Grande, Arizona... The green liquid
hydrogen plant is slated to begin production next year. It will be
used for serving the Californian mobility market, in addition to those
in other locations that require renewable H2 to meet their net zero
carbon emission goals"

What to do with the CO2?

"Turning CO2 to stone.. Basalt, which is created as lava cools,
contains calcium, iron, and magnesium, which react naturally with CO2
to form solid carbonate minerals. Within two years, 95 percent of the
injected CO2 had turned to mineral.. Basalt, which made Iceland the
ideal location, is also abundant beneath the oceans, including just
off shore from coastal power plants"

H2 production is possible with chemical looping

"[2012] As one of the potential [CCS] solutions, chemical looping
technologies are projected to be economically advantageous in a
carbon-constrained scenario... The chemical looping tecnology is
capable of..  reducing the energy intensive carbon capture step due to
its in-situ CO2 separation inherent in the reaction pathway
design.. [The tech] utilizes a metal oxide material as an oxygen
carrier medium to indirectly oxidize the fuel and generate
high-quality heat and/or H2. Cyclic reduction–oxidation reactions are
performed in discrete reactor vessels allowing for inherent air–fuel
separation, which provides intrinsic CO2 separation thus mitigating
the cost for CO2 capture...

Chemical looping processes can be described by two key applications:
chemical looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping gasification
(CLG). CLC processes use carbonaceous fuel sources, such as coal,
biomass, and natural gas, to reduce the oxygen carrier and are
followed by their direct oxidation with air to produce high-quality
heat, which can then be used for electricity
generation. Alternatively, the CLG system utilizes a third
intermediate step between the air and fuel reactor to produce a clean
energy carrier. Here, steam and/or CO2 is used to partially oxidize
the reduced oxygen carrier to produce H2"

oxy-combustion technology used to convert biomass and fossil fuels in
order to obtain a flow of pure CO2 suitable for low-cost capture"

Units boe are barrels of oil, mb, or mboe is million barrels, for gas
they use boe too - in terms of energy they calculated the equivalent
amount from gas volume into barrels, so oil and gas can be measured in
same units. Gboe is billions of barrels.

New oil and gas discoveries per year (billion barrels of oil equivalent).
Discoveries have been falling in a big way since 2008.

Has 50 mil barrels worth, if they extracted it in a year that would be
abt 140K barrels a day, 9 Gigawatts of energy. However in a year it
wld all be GONE. Tapped out.

"New oil discovery in Gulf of Suez is one of area’s largest in 20
years.. As reported by Reuters, Egypt’s Petroleum Minister, Tarek El
Molla, said that there are about 45 to 50 million barrels that can be
extracted, which could be done in less than a year"

Most new fossil action is offshore. ExxonMobil upped its estimate for
the "Stabroek Block" find offshore Guyana, which is approx 10 billion
barrels. Largest in the world, Ghawar Saudi Arabia, had 96
billion. West Qurna Field in Iraq, 14 billion, and it is in Top 20.

Guyana is the neighbor of Venezuela, in northern SA.

"[T]he potential terraforming of Venus has received some
consideration, beginning with Carl Sagan.. Venus also provides some
advantages over Mars for colonization with its near-Earth-like surface
gravity, an atmosphere thick enough to provide robust protection from
cosmic rays..

An alternative to terraforming the surface of Venus would be to
colonize the upper atmosphere..  Taking advantage of the twin facts
that the upper atmosphere of Venus at an altitude of 50-55 km has a
similar temperature and pressure to Earth’s surface, and that nitrogen
and oxygen are lifting gases in Venus’s CO2 atmosphere, it would be
possible to construct 'cloud cities' using aerostats filled with
breathable air that could be inhabited by humans. This method
sidesteps most of the problems of colonizing the surface; it would be
achievable with current technology, and it has reached the level of a
mission concept..

In this paper, I propose a method of terraforming Venus that similarly
sidesteps most of the problems posed by the hostile conditions on the
surface by expanding the cloud city concept to 'cloud continents,'..
Nearly all of the requisite materials for the project would be
produced locally on Venus, while water could be delivered from Mars
via space elevator"

WION called Middle East as "West Asia". I like it. Middle East is too
European centric, bcz the region is *to their* East. But West Asia is
neutral, doesn't assume an origin of view.
