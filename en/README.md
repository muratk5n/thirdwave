"Chevron, Iwatani to develop 30 hydrogen stations in California by 2026"

---

Once US catches momentum it will be like nothing anyone has ever
seen..  Our American friends are good at scale. This thing will be
huge.

---

To repeat US sunshine states CA, NV, UT, AZ, NM, CO. They clearly have
bunch of other resources to boot.. And perhaps expertise around
handling chemicals, storage, transport.

Fantastic. 

"Colorado, Utah and Wyoming will all compete for a portion of the $8bn
allocated by the US Department of Energy for the development of
regional clean hydrogen hubs as they look to play pivotal roles in the
US hydrogen economy. Governors of the above states unveiled their
intentions to develop a New Mexico hydrogen hub to utilise heavily
available natural resources in the region, such as high-quality wind,
solar, biomass, natural gas and other energy resources"

"Hyundai, Shell to support the hydrogen mobility market under new
deal.. Low carbon emissions products and services, including hydrogen
offerings for the mobility market, are the key focus of a new
agreement inked today (Feb 25) between Hyundai Motor Company and Shell"

Jane's Defense: "Philippines signs contract for 32 S-70i Black Hawks"

---

World system is fukked - needs a change from top to bottom.

And he Russian guy is like "but I can veto this resolution bitch"

US side at UN: "You cannot veto our voices; You cannot veto the truth;
You cannot veto our principles; You cannot veto the Ukrainian people".

If SE, FI has Russian minorities kick them out now

ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ Part of me wants to see it happen just to see what they would do
for the f--k of it

"Finland, Sweden brush off Moscow's warning on joining NATO"

---

On cue..

"Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs says there would be 'serious
military and political repercussions' if Finland were to be granted
NATO membership"

---

\#Finlandisation

[[-]](https://youtu.be/N6aOk0SiHgI)

---

Oh no.. what word will we use then instead of Finlandisation?

"Finnish Prime Minister Sanna Marin said that Russia's invasion in
Ukraine 'will change' debate surrounding Finland's accession to NATO"

---

Now Chechnia is ruled by a Kremlin stooge who says 'he loves Putin like
a father'.

---

Yea well.. Hopefully the end doesn't resemble the Chechen
war. Remember satellite images of the capital Grozny, afterwards.. The
only thing flatter than that city would be a parking lot.

"@RALee85

Two US officials confirmed that Ukraine shot down a second Il-76
transport aircraft tonight. If true, this would be a really
significant mistake for the Russian military, and possibly the worst
loss of life for the Russian Airborne Forces since the 2nd Chechen
War"

ML is also AI, and AI is Frankenstein / Pinoccio. Take your pick. Ergo
by optimizing you could be bringing about Skynet. So say bunch of IT
dipshits who pose like science geniuses.

"@MadVictorZ

So, according to ML jargon, solving this problem:

min f(x) s.t. g(x)=0

means that I am 'learning' its solution.  Therefore, optimization is
just ML. Gotcha"
