Slate: "The federal government created this beautiful park
[Yellowstone]. Guess who doesn’t want to admit it? *Yellowstone:
One-Fifty* sidesteps the truth, which is the Hayden survey [that led
to the creation of the park] was an unabashedly federal project. He
had Congressional funding and orders from the Department of the
Interior. He and his team took the transcontinental railroad (the
existence of which was the end result of another federal project) to
Utah to begin the survey. He had a 2nd Cavalry protective detail out
of Fort Ellis (a federal installation). His Yellowstone survey report
was printed and distributed by the Government Printing Office"

The prevalence of QED could have something do with Europeans feeling a
bit down about themselves at the time.. Imagine that Shelter Island
meeting, two years after the end of the WWII where Europe had
destroyed itself (again), and here they are, the elder scientist are
sitting in a New World conference, watching two young American
scientists all wired, flailing away talking energetically about some
crazy bizarre theory hopped up on their Coca-Cola - Europeans must
have thought, well, maybe this crazy shit is the new way, we destroyed
ourselves with our science and tech. Who knows? Maybe we should pass
the torch..

Theoretical physics (along with cosmology) has gone awry, ever since
70s nothing of significance has been done, and worse, bizarre
unfounded theories like string theory were pursued for decades. Where
to pin the blame?

QED could be the original sin. Think about it, once you ignore data,
engage in scientific fraud, push whopping infinities under the rug to
make a theory "work" what else can you not do? 11-12 dimensions, the
multiverse, many-worlds, quantum computation.. the sky will be the
limit. Because now you are only "limited by your imagination" (cue in
the image of a wacky Einstein), anything goes, right?
