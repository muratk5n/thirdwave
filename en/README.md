Let's phase out grids, power can be generated near end-points as
needed.

They will be generating power from fuel-cells. Great.

H2 Central: "A Norwegian consortium comprised of four local players,
PSW Power & Automation, Westgass Hydrogen, CCB and H2 Production, has
been established to provide a hydrogen-based shore power solution to
the maritime sector...

'We have shown that our container-based power solutions can be fuelled
by hydrogen, and together with our partners we have demonstrated that
the value chain for such solutions is in place.'

Platform suppliers, cruise ships, drilling rigs and fish farms that
rely heavily on diesel generators can each consume the equivalent of
the power requirement of 400 to 500 houses for their onboard
operations.

Connecting to onshore power supply when docking at ports and shipyards
is a preferred solution to reduce emissions, but CCB said it is facing
significant challenges in meeting demand due to capacity constraints
in the electricity grid"

Claim is due to limited troops RU had pulled resources from Kharkiv
and sent them to Donbas which created an opening for UKR to
exploit. That shortage is now being fixed with partial mobilisation.

In the end IMO RU will take what they were aiming for, no matter
what... The only question is how many people die in between now and
then. Sad.

---

Annexation referandum (whose outcome will surprise noone) and 300 K RU
mobilisation.. why is that surprising? Ukraine is an existential issue
for Russia.

Star comm can lose messages in the middle (not listening) even that
is preferable to all-connected-to-all style.

It's great when a problem reduces to a mere eigenvector/value calculation

Al Monitor: "Israel must end its occupation of Palestine, Qatari emir
tells UN General Assembly"

---

Al Monitor: "Palestinian street battles point to wider West Bank
crisis. Gun battles in central Nablus, with young Palestinians
fighting police and setting blazes that shut the city down, signal
growing chaos in the northern West Bank that could spiral out of
control"

Al Jazeera: "Iraq’s mighty Tigris river is drying up.. Drying
riverbeds mean Iraqi authorities have had to sharply cut the area of
cultivated land in the country"

H2 Fuel News: "Last Month, Southern California Gas (SoCalGas) and The
Blue Oval announced that they were developing a Ford F-550 prototype
for a Super Duty hydrogen fuel cell truck. The project was a component
of the US Department of Energy (DoE) SuperTruck 3 program for
considerably reducing medium-and heavy-duty vehicle emissions"

By just looking at connectivity graph, one can see man-in-the-middle
centric star-pattern is more efficient than all-connected-all style.
The latter would be "participatory" democracy the former is
representative.

Overcommunication.. not good
