Wrote before the EU would not want to allow pieces of existing members
to apply anyway bcz that would discourage others joining the EU
(fearing their subregions would want to apply one day). 

---

EU membership is good for Spain bcz inside it could veto the
membership of its subregions, eg. Catalonia, were it decide to
seperate from Spain and apply for membership seperately. Makes sense.

The Atlantic: "The Hobbit King.. Charles III is far more interested in
the benefits of traditional English hedgerows than the great, global
glory of Britain.

Far from resisting such royal parochialism, Britain should embrace
Charles as the emblem of its new normal age. Very few people in the
world know the names of the Dutch, Danish, or Norwegian monarchs, but
their citizens are much more prosperous and their kingdoms more
settled. If Charles joins them in comparative anonymity, that should
be celebrated.

In 1962, a decade into Britain’s second Elizabethan age, the American
grandee Dean Acheson caused real hurt and anger in London by declaring
that Britain had lost an empire but had yet to find a role. The entire
reign of Elizabeth was filled with her chief ministers searching for
the answer to this challenge. But with her passing, Britain can cease
its search. Not playing a central role in the great game is a
perfectly noble aspiration, a liberating opportunity—and one that King
Charles is well suited to symbolize"

Al Jazeera: "[D]egrowth movement has steadily been
gaining ground. Based on a robust body of scientific literature,
degrowth proponents suggest that capitalism’s demand for unlimited
growth is destroying the planet..

[M]any people understand degrowth.. as a call for austerity and a
trigger of recession. In reality, degrowth is just the opposite.

To begin with, austerity is always imposed for the sake of growth. We
have been convinced, for half a century now, that cutting public
services is good for us because it will increase competitiveness,
balance the budget, and eventually lead to growth. Degrowth, by
contrast, is the argument that we can, and should, move away from an
economy that exclusively depends on economic growth"

Scott Adkins movies do resemble stock Jason Statham work sometimes,
the acting and the story are little better. *Accident Man* writing was
good (apparently SA wrote it himself)
