Paid family leave is being added back to BBB? Grand.

Mcauliffe made a mistake by making those comments during the debate
triggering a culture war, but centrist shitlibs have no choice but to
go there.  He cant hit the other guy on Carlyle, what else is he going
to talk about?

"@LHSummers

I am certainly no left wing ideologue, but I think something wrong
when taxpayers like me, well into the top .1 percent of income
distribution, are getting a significant tax cut in a Democrats only
tax bill as now looks likely to happen"

JS seems to have moved on..

Tucker did talk more about econ later, but at its inception FN was
geared for hack.

But it's yesteryear stuff..

The game was easy to mobilize for..  Take Fox News. Get the
only anti-abortion Episcopalian [in the world](https://youtu.be/AXGoWtK1NnY?t=2123)
and make him anchor. Then get bunch of "Irish" in there, Calahan,
Shanahan, Cardigan or whatever... Done.  The line up defines the discourse.

This was a game concocted for specific goals.. Fans cheering for
either side vehemently were either idiots, or in it for the money.

".. [the plan would] allow Clinton to 'push [Reps] to the right' on .. issues
like gun control and a woman's right to choose"

Obviously both sides in US partook in this culture war, especially 90s
Dems. See [triangulation](2021/10/all-too-human.md#triangulation)

The headline of his paper says "Abu's Been Sleeping In My Bed", guy is
laughing his ass off.. surprised? I don't think he is racist, u
see. Him and his orgs just like to stir shit up.. Whatever gets a rise out
of people, on 'either side', they'll do.

Murdoch is a native of the country anyway, he cut his teeth there,
before he exported the shit overseas, so UK could end up with
[this](tweets/2021/murdoch_abu_sleeping.jpg).

Climate decisions do not come easy for Oz. The country is a major
resource exporter, but also Murdoch media, of Australia, is active
there, scratches that itch constantly, the way they do for culture war
in America. An earlier PM thinks he was done in by Murdoch. The current
coalition partner had an internal coup bcz of Net Zero discussions.

Mucker is a Vanderbilt heir, worked at the CIA... It's clear where his
loyalties lie, with the one-party state.

"@kayrosef

Anderson Cooper just asked if Terry McAuliffe lost because the
Democratic Party is 'too far left'.

Terry McAuliffe is a centrist"
