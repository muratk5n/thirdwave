The Turing Test poisoned the minds of generations of AI enthusiasts,
because its criteria is producing text that persuades observers it was
written by a human.

The result? Generative AI text products designed to "appear real"
rather than produce accurate or ethical outputs.

It *should* be obvious why it's problematic to create a piece of
software that excels at persuasion without concern for accuracy,
honesty or ethics. But apparently it's not"

Fundamental research has seen giants in its past; Gauss could ask a
graduate student to "go formalize some stuff on geometry", and dude
would go off and *invent topology* (this is Riemann fyi). Or Hilbert,
whose mere questions would spur deep research and continue to do so to
this day. Who is the equivalent figure here? Edward Witten?  Guy got
sucked into the quicksand of string theory now is so stuck that when
asked about what else is there promising other than string theory in
an interview he'll flatly respond "there is there is nothing else" ðŸ˜¶
- imagine that, says this despite the field not having produced
anything of significance for the past 40+ years. Grand fail.

After WWII US became the center of science; they were supposed to be
the stewards of fundamental research. But at least from physics point
of view they've done a piss poor job of it. The fruitless avenues
scientists are stuck at now remind me how bizarre gismos that are
constantly "invented" there, the same mentality seems to have been
applied to fundamental science. The problem is gismos go away if they
can't find traction, but the bizarre avenues linger until the lost
muckers stuck in them are dead or their funding is cut. Rube Goldberg
approach doesn't work for fundamentals.

Small win IMO; electricity consumption is only 15-20% of all energy
consumption. You could reach the "biggest" number by producing 51% of
15%, which still puts you less than 8% of all energy.

I'd say at this juncture in geo pol, this guy could come in handy for
Russia. How crazy would it be Bout arranges purchasing of stolen
US arms from Ukraine for Russia?

From book *Merchant of Death*, "Bout cultivated close business and
social ties with some of the Third Worldâ€™s.. strongmen. He dealt
directly with Charles Taylor in Liberia, Mubuto Sese Seko in Zaire,
Paul Kagame in Rwanda, and rebel leaders Jonas Savimbi in Angola,
Jean-Pierre Bemba in the DRC, and Sam 'Mosquito' Bockarie in Sierra
Leone. Bout armed and hunted with Ahmad Shah Massoud, the resistance
fighter and Northern Alliance leader who became an Afghan hero but who
was also accused of massacring his foes. Boutâ€™s organization then
nimbly switched sides in Afghanistan, covertly aiding the despotic
Taliban regime, secretly providing the Islamic militants with their
own fleet of cargo planes and flying in weapons and supplies that
aided both the mullahs and their al Qaeda financiers"

Hah! I knew Cengic's son.. During the civil war he sent the kid to
Stanpoli, where we were at. Tough son a bitch, we'd figured the father
was probably the muscle in their gov. Small world.

Wiki: "Supposedly, Bout had been involved with arms dealings during
the Yugoslav Wars, especially with the Bosnian government forces
during its uprising against the Milosevic government in
Yugoslavia. Hasan Cengic, who was the former Deputy Prime Minister and
Defense Minister of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is
allegedly one of his former contacts"

Read a little about his bio, thought this sounds like the character in
*Lord of War*, and voila, the movie was partly based on him.

US traded arms dealer Viktor Bout for Griner?
