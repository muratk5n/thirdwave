"2,500 tonne per year low-carbon hydrogen project to be developed in
Canada.. The hydrogen production project will utilise Hazer technology
with FortisBC supplying the natural gas feedstock required in order to
generate the hydrogen"

---

Electricity is a waste, a dead-end tech in many ways; push it down to
end-user, local level, generate as needed. For storage, transport, raw
energy generation all needs to be molecule based. CSP goes from heat
to pure H2.

DOE has lit on solar thermochemical water splitting.

---

I joined a DOE Webinar and got that quote from the said expert. ðŸ¤“

---

CSP Expert: "There are several potential ways of generating hydrogen
using CSP. A number of researchers (and a couple of startup companies)
are developing 'solar thermochemical water splitting' which uses a
catalyst (like ceria) at very high temperature to split steam into
nhydrogen and oxygen. CSP can also be integrated with high temperature
steam electrolysis (using solid oxide electrolysis cells) to
electrolytically split water at higher efficiencies than typical PEM
electrolyzers"

If Bulgaria spends four times as Sweden spends on heating, this means
their insulation is probably four times worse. Likely true for many
countries in the world. Fix that, cut emissions by 10%. Blend 20% to
existing natgas infra, another 10%.

---

That sounds right

"Buildings account for 36% of EU GHG emissions and 40% of its energy
use: energy efficiency is the most cost-effective method of reducing
their emissions.'.. Innovative SMEs based in the EU are developing a
range of solutions for a more energy-efficient building stock...
[such as a]dvanced low-carbon materials, including high-performance,
unobtrusive insulation techniques"

Nearly 40% of energy use cannot possibly be causing 20% of the
emissions. 

"Heating, cooling is responsible for 20% of GHG emissions"

Doubling nuke plants globally sound far-fetched.. Too many are freaked
out about them; first they'll say 'yeah a GW level nuke plant sounds
great man!'. But you ask if they want it in their backyard, near their
city, they go 'aw man, like, no, how about the neighboring state,
they'll be fine with that.. not here'

H2 View: "US Senators discuss clean hydrogen at an energy
committee.. US Senator Joe Manchin has discussed the positive impact
clean hydrogen could have on the domestic economy.. 'That is why I
made research, development, and demonstration of these technologies a
central part of the Energy Infrastructure Act..  In that bill, we fund
$9.5bn in research, development, and demonstration of clean hydrogen
and we task the Department of Energy to develop a national strategy
and roadmap to get us to a clean hydrogen economy'"

"EU sanctions would target Russiaâ€™s financial and energy sectors if
Moscow opts to invade Ukraine, EU Commission chief Ursula von der
Leyen said Friday"

There were gazillion different ways of saying what he said that in a
debate. You say 'we'll look into the issue', 'I hear some of the
concerns of the parents' blah blah..  invite them in, even include
them somehow.. But then keep teaching the truth.

That's not what this mucker did. He blew a fuse, got all mad, bcz the
real issue is there were two people on that debate connnected to the
Carlyle Group, they have nothing else to disagree on, so the Dem
libtard gets triggered. The situation could easily be deflected,
instead TM gave the other side ammunition for culture war. But guess
what - in culture wars Reps usually win, so he had his ass handed to
him, proving once again the bizarre Dem moderate centrism has a
long-term electability problem.

Roddenberry was a combat pilot in WWII. As a civilian his plane
crashed in Syria due to engine failure he pulled passangers to safety
from burning fire. He was not a mediocre shitlib boomer watching civil
rights protests on TV getting stoned on a bong while getting a blowjob
and thinking if he was ever on the board of one of those bloodsucking
big corporations one day he'd like to see some 'diversity'
there.. Those sisters in the protests looked hot!

DIS stock fall pre-Feb might have priced in the Q4 fails, which showed
up in the gross profit. Later the perception improved. I'd watch Q1,
if lower GM, problem.

What is gross profit margin? See Buffett's [open buffet](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buffett-financial-statements-income-statement-204642939.html)

Revenue growth fine, gross profit margin doesn't look great - DIS
spending too much on non-profitable projects? ðŸ¤” IMO last quarter saw
some triumphs, but also a lot of misses.
