Using tech to merely extend an inefficient solution is
suboptimal. Tech should allow new ways of working. Linux wasn't built
bcz people could "chat" overseas or "Zoom". The project, besides Linus
Torvalds' leadership, was made possible through async concepts such as
the email, and shared code repos, and the patch file.

Hah. Just heard guy on RT say "Germany destroyed its nuclear sector,
now have to rely on 90% natural gas for power generation". [Incorrect](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FEYfMPoWYAEUpOs?format=jpg&name=small)

The rabble-rouser, thorn-on-the-side shtick is fine, but plz don't
pull bizarre non-truths out of your ass \#RT

Expanding existing infra for the shiny product obviously makes the
overall approach even stupider. Gov had to lead, not follow bunch of
salesmen.

---

Even then, the BEV was considered as a ridiculous solution by many for
a long time, but as the drums of climate apocalypse became louder,
some started to think "maybe to avert that crazy end, I do need this
dumb-ass shit". A strange way to land at a conclusion, and of course,
faulty. Shoulda asked for better infra

---

The world became too used to solving problems throught those little,
shiny products, coming from the private sector, having been
brainwashed by neoliberalism.. Such products are stand-alone units of
goods that can be sold, expected to work on their own, assuming
certain infra backdrop.. nothing more.

Climate cannot be solved with such isolated trinkets. This is how an
inferior tech, the battery electric car, became en vogue, that
singular product trying to exist in a certain environment (the wall
plug). New and different infrastructure could have changed the
underlying Calculus completely, much earlier.

The word Istanbul comes from the Greek word Stanpoli, it means "in the
city". So trying to avoid Constantinople bcz it sounds Greek lands you
with Istanbul which also comes from Greek. Boom. This puts TR
nationalists in a bind doesn't it? Much in TR nat narrative is a
baseless, crooked fabrication.

---

Climate activists on air quality of Stanpoli, Asia Minor; they say the
smog seen there recently was pollution, not harmless mist... I've been
checking the pollution levels through OWM, half the time I see AQI at
a 5, the worst level.. Not good.

SJW is a problem, sure, but Focker himself is a [shady fock](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-15/peter-thiel-gamed-silicon-valley-tech-trump-taxes-and-politics).

Doh! That's Focker's university isn't it?

The testing area is relatively far to AU/NZ landmass, 6K kilometers,
but hey, it ain't on the other side of the world either, like the
Mojave Desert. Could irk some people.. They tested btw
60s-90s. Received protests from AU, NZ each time.

Found out about France's little unpopularity problem in Oz, due to
nuclear tests conducted in the South Pacific (in the so-called French
Polynesia). Maybe this is partly why they could be sacrificed easily
as a partner, the Oz general view would not care too much..

The gun issue is so radicalized it became an unsolvable mess. Dick
Morris is laughing his ass off right now \#triangulation. He had Dems
get stuck in the mud. Pat yourselves on the back corporate Dems.. you
let a Republican operative do that to you

Guilty or not guilty, self-defense or no.. This is arguing tangential minutea
