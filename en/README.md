Parties sticking to ideologies matters because people don't vote in
policies, they vote out people. Ergo when a new admim comes in, voters
should automatically get a different way of governing through that
different party. If voters are switching between globalist centrist
cuck \#1 vs globalist centrist cuck \#2, that's not a change.

Peter Voit: [See] [The quantum computing bubble](https://www.ft.com/content/6d2e34ab-f9fd-4041-8a96-91802bab7765) 
at the Financial Times, where Nikita Gourianov argues that there’s a
speculative bubble going on in this field, and:

'Well, when exactly the bubble will pop is difficult to say, but at
some point the claims will be found out and the funding will dry up. I
just hope that when the music stops and the bubble pops, the public
will still listen to us physicists'...

I think Gourianov makes an important point for physicists to keep in
mind. Having this sort of hype blow up in physicist’s faces is not
going to help with the credibility problems physics already has with
the public due to decades of hype about non-existent breakthroughs in
fundamental physics

Nuclear fission is also free energy in many ways, the ratio of energy
obtained with energy applied is immensely large. It is possible to get
something for nothing.

---

That sounds like free energy..  No additional energy input is applied,
when the catalyst splits water, is not reduced itself in the process
so it could do the splitting forever creating energy.

H2 Fuel News: "[Researchers] at UCSC [found] a way to complete [water
splitting for H2 generation] process at room temperature, without the
requirement of the electric input. They have done so through the
development of a special aluminum composite that causes a reaction
with the water at room temperature. Aluminum is naturally a reactive
material that will cause the oxygen to split away from water
molecules, allowing the H2 to remain...

The researchers discovered that by applying an easily created
composite of aluminum and gallium, the aluminum will react with water
even at room temperature, resulting in the production of H2 without
CO2 emissions"

Crude is indeed down

CNBC: "Gas prices are falling — Here's why it's happening.. Some
states have also suspended their gas taxes, which artificially pushes
prices lower. But the main reason for the fall is the decline in oil
prices. Crude is the single largest factor influencing gas prices,
accounting for more than 50% of what we pay at the pump"
