H2 Central: "Fabrum partner with HWR to decarbonise its transport
fleet with hydrogen... Fabrum’s world-leading AFCryocooler cryogenic
technology, which enables gas separation and liquefaction, combined
with patented Membrane-Free Electrolyser™ technology from UK company
Clean Power Hydrogen (CPH2) – splits water into pure hydrogen and
medical grade oxygen – without the polymer membrane used in common PEM
electrolysers. A 1.1 MW system can produce 450kg of hydrogen per day
from water"

FCHEA: "As more and more countries continue to use hydrogen, it’s
worth revisiting countries.. such as China and India...

China has been an early adopter of hydrogen, and many of its
previous laws and regulations called for the adoption of a hydrogen
economy. Recently however, the Chinese government published the first
official hydrogen plan for the country, designed to set specific
guidelines, and long-term growth targets for the hydrogen industry.
The plan covers a wide range of areas, from manufacturing, and
research capabilities, manufacturing targets, and specific goals for
hydrogen production and consumption... Overall, the central government
seeks to “significantly improve” the portion of clean hydrogen in use
across China by 2035. To do so, the government released some nearer
term targets to produce up to 200,000 tons of clean hydrogen.. In
addition to the central government, local governments and the private
sector are also getting involved in the clean hydrogen economy...

India has also begun to recognize clean hydrogen as essential to
decarbonization. The Indian government recently announced a “phase
one” document for clean hydrogen production, and released a set of
policies in early 2022. The policies include allowing clean hydrogen
producers to buy renewable energy at reduced rates, simplifying the
permitting and licensing process to prioritize clean hydrogen, and
allowing the construction of storage containers next to ports designed
for hydrogen. The government has also promised to waive inter-state
transmission charges for 25 years if the project is commissioned
before June 30, 2025. This would significantly reduce the cost of
clean hydrogen, potentially jumpstarting the hydrogen economy in
India. This is all part of the government’s effort to reduce carbon
emissions to zero by 2070. The government plans to release more
policies to encourage the use of hydrogen production, including
manufacturing zones dedicated to clean hydrogen"

ERR News: "Estonia is aiming to create a nationwide Hydrogen Valley to
further develop energy independence and in anticipation of the
European Green Deal.. In the coming six years, green hydrogen
production will be developed in at least six regions in the
country. The hydrogen produced in Estonia will be used for hydrogen
fuelling public transport, heavy-duty vehicles, rail, shipping,
aviation, and other transport modalities. During this time, it is
planned to form a "complete and full nationwide hydrogen value chain"
that will accelerate the energy transition and independence of the
whole country under the motto '"from zero to green", a press release
issued by Tartu City Council said"

H2 Central: "The Korea H2 Business Summit, a hydrogen council
established primarily by major companies such as Hyundai Motor, SK and
POSCO, set up a fund to promote the hydrogen industry.

The fund worth 500 billion won (US$383 million) will be established
via investments from domestic member companies and foreign investors
and is expected to be liquidated after 10 years of operation...

Bahn Sang-woo, a managing director of Mirae Asset Securities, said:
'The fund set the yield rate target at 8 percent, with 70 percent of
the fund used for the establishment of infrastructure and 30 percent
for technology investment'"

Politico: "The question of whether to grant an exception to sanctions
on Russia in order to fix the Nord Stream 1 pipeline saw Canada torn
between the demands of Germany, which remains dependent on Russian
fuel, and Ukraine’s pleas to cut Russian revenue streams.

Canada will grant a 'time-limited and revocable permit' so Siemens can
deliver turbines to Germany following their maintenance in Montreal,
Natural Resources Minister.. announced'"

Davis: "There Is No ‘Magic Bullet’ That Can Turn The Tide For
Ukraine... In some instances, fighting tenaciously in the face of
considerable enemy superiority can prove to be the difference between
victory and defeat. For example, in the famous Battle of the Bulge,
the U.S. 101st Airborne Division refused to surrender in Bastogne even
after it had been surrounded and cut off by the advancing German
army...

The U.S. commander, however, had good reason to hold on even against
an enemy with overwhelming numbers of artillery and tanks: as soon as
the fog and cloud cover broke, the U.S. commander could expect massive
air support to break the back of the German assaults and aerial
resupply of ammunition and food to Bastogne’s defenders. More
critically, Gen. George S. Patton’s 4th Armored Division was also
racing north to relieve the 101st. For the Ukraine defenders, on the
other hand, there is no such help coming...

The much-ballyhooed supply of 'heavy weapons' from the West..  will
not be enough to turn the tide"
