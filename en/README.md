capacity to generate over 250,000 metric tons of fuel annually.

"Rep. Andy Levin... wants a two-state solution to be official
U.S. policy, and new legislation he’ll propose tomorrow sets out a

for weather is mostly known so no need to reverse-engineer an unknown
model using a jungle of neurons from data, as is done in "AI".

Even then, the computation is extremely hard.
