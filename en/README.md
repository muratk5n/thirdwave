This race already happened, the H2 car did great

"At the end of April 2021, Toyota announced it would be testing the
performance of a new hydrogen-fuelled internal combustion engine by
installing it in a racecar that would compete in one of Japanâ€™s
toughest motorsports events: The NAPAC Fuji Super TEC 24 Hours"

Forbes: "[March 2021] As Hydrogenâ€™s Levelized Cost Projections Fall
Toyota Sends It Racing.. [H2] levelized cost, or the measure of
average net present cost of production as a fuel or heat source for a
generating plant over its lifetime, especially from renewable energy
via electrolysis of water, is likely to fall considerably over the
coming years..

Should the forecasts materialize, such 'low renewable hydrogen costs
could completely rewrite the energy map," says Martin Tengler, lead
hydrogen analyst at BNEF. 'It shows that in future, at least a third
of the world economy could be powered by clean energy for not a cent
more than it pays for fossil fuels.'..

Automakers and their partner fuel vendors in many quarters remain
suitably excited, and none more so than Toyota. The Japanese automaker
has consistently nailed its colors to the mast via its Mirai range. It
is now going one step further by testing the performance of a new
hydrogen [combustion] engine by installing it in a race car that will
compete in one of Japan's toughest motorsport events"

Energy Voice: "[Scated] also recently signed an agreement with Indiaâ€™s
ACME Group to build and operate a green ammonia plant in Oman. The
first phase will produce 100,000 tpy of green ammonia, scaling up to
1.2mn tpy"

Energy Voice: "[Norway's] Scatec signs up to mammoth green ammonia
plan in Egypt.. a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a green
hydrogen and ammonia plant in Egypt [was signed]...  The plant will
produce 1 million tonnes per year of green ammonia initially, it
said. It will have the opportunity to reach 3mn tpy ultimately"

Sounds like a smart guy, obviously knows where the action is

The Sydney Morning Herald: "[Reserve Bank of Australia] heir apparent
Guy Debelle unexpectedly quits to join Forrestâ€™s green hydrogen
play.. The future of [RBA] has been upended with the man considered
most likely to lead the interest rate setting institution through the
rest of the decade quitting to join private sector efforts to secure
Australiaâ€™s green hydrogen future. Dr Guy Debelle, deputy to governor
Philip Lowe since 2016 and perceived by many as one of the RBAâ€™s
brightest minds, stunned monetary policy circles on Thursday by
revealing plans to become Fortescue Future Industriesâ€™ chief financial
officer"

H2 View: "UK-based Levidian recently developed a device which uses
plasma technology to separate methane into its constituent atoms:
carbon, locked into high-quality graphene, and hydrogen, which can
either be used immediately or stored for future use. According to the
climate-tech company, their model means they can offer turquoise
hydrogen at little to no cost, as there is a thriving market for the
by-product produced during the process â€“ high-quality graphene"

Thats good but fixing the base energy infrastructure (using clean
fuels everywhere) would fix all pollution in one fell swoop.

u can really clamp down on it, but then backtracked on backtracking..

Am fine personally with individual, even positive rights. Just saying
not everyone cld be on the same boat, on the same schedule. If a new
non-military org was to be founded for democracies, I'd argue it
should have only carrot, no stick.

---

Liberalism is about the individual, who can think freely, but that can
lead to conflicts, so you need a state to protect rights.

Therefore, one can continue, if everyone has such inalienable rights,
they do so all over the world too, a liberal state is pushed to try to
expand it abroad -- through coercion, or sometimes by force.

---

'Not understanding' states like Russia cld be due to liberalism's
mental block..  See [Meirsheimer](2022/03/liberal-dreams-intl-realities.md).

---

What's the deal w NATO chief Stoltenberg 'Central Bank appointent
announcement' right in the beginning of the conflict? Is he being
'demoted upwards'? He was talking tough game early on, then NATO got
cucked.

---

Putin finds those blind spots, and exploits them well. 'Rules based
order' means ppl following them are predictable.

---

NATO was sadly a disadvantage in this conflict. Motto "one for all,
all for one" works *if you are in it*. If outside, the deterrent
aspect becomes a disadvantage. They are built to kick some serious
ass, which means going all in, with everyone on board, which you
cannot do even partially in a situation such as in UKR. So they were
reduced to watching the whole conf from the sidelines.

---

My assumption was since 2014 UKR had been loading for bear, have all
aspects of a possible war covered, with NATO's help. Then found out
abt the air/sea shortcomings, it became clear this cld turn into
another Aleppo, Grozny.
