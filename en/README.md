H2 Fuel News: "Gilbarco Veeder-root Prepares For The Hydrogen
Transport Revolution.. It is making available a suite of compression,
dispensing and software solutions, allowing the creation of a network
of renewable or low-carbon hydrogen refuelling stations around the
world. The company is now at advanced stages of developing new
technologies and creating partnerships to.. offer gaseous hydrogen to
serve an ever-increasing number of hydrogen fuel-cell powered
vehicles"

green hydrogen project... One year after its inception, LONGi Hydrogen
has won the Sinopec Green Hydrogen Demonstration Project, to supply
‘world leading large scale’ alkaline water electrolyser equipment"

The grid even looks like shit. [Seriously](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXSTCWYWAAIHhx1?format=jpg&name=small). 

But see a [pipeline](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FMA3m-DWUAMDe-D?format=jpg&name=small).
A straight-forward, efficient structure.

---

H2 pipelines are equally efficient compared to the grid. So there is
no need to remain as an 'electricity person'.

"@LionHirth

As an electricity person, I keep being humbled by the energy-carrying
capacity of gas infrastructure. A pipeline (say, Nord Stream 1) can
carry gas worth 540 TWh per year. That's 30x times the energy you can
put through an HVDC line. Thirty"

2021 had 516 billion cubic meters of LNG shipped (the volume is of
what natgas liquid translates into when gasified, not of the liquid
itself). In BOE terms `516*1e9 / (170*1e3*365)` means 8315 kboe / day,
equivalent to 10 Nordstream pipelines. Not bad.

Secular liberals pride themselves for not following church teachings,
as they have "advanced beyond that" and are now "enlightened". But
they do follow things -secular media, officials' edicts- and they do
follow quite blindly. Electrification mantra was handed down from such
channels, and these fuckers ate that up like there was no tomorrow,
and asked for more. That makes them a herd of sorts, albeit of a
different type than pre-modern religious, but a herd all the same.

---

Here's something funnier; the fossil fuel lobby might have allowed
these imbeciles to become visible because the lobby knew they'd go
around and around, hit a brick wall, fail and eventually come back to
their arms in desperation, wanting more fossil fuel.

This would have been diabolical but still shortsighted... e-retards
managed to create a retarded buzz which grew also thanks to low
rates. At the same time climate was truly in danger, **and** there was
a viable option which remained unexplored because of retards wasting
time / resources. Double whammy. Fossil lobby would have been better
served to find that optimal, clean route that benefited everyone.

They talk big game on multiple universes, time, multiple dimensions,
math..  But dividing 431 by 70 and multiplying by 60? Nah can't do that.
That calc would have [given them](2022/02/base-energy-numbers.html#lithium)
the amount of lithium required to store one day's worth of energy on
batteries, and compared to 17 mtonnes (available reserves), it
would make blatanty clear the popular conception was shit.

---

Scientists roam... they roam the media, MSM, alternative, or
otherwise..  Yet most of these people are just trend followers.. They
followed the electrification mantra without thinking about it
themselves.

Suez data

```python
import pandas as pd;df = pd.read_csv('suez.csv',index_col=0)
print (df[['novessel','net(mton)']].tail(3))
```

```text
      novessel  net(mton)
year                     
2019     18880     1207.1
2020     18829     1170.0
2021     20694     1127.0
```

If trend continues ships `5303*4=21212` and net tonnage `313*4=1252`
will beat the previous year's numbers. Busy busy busy.. We need more
canals, wider canals..

"Head of the Suez Canal Authority.. said.. that more than 5,303 ships
carrying a combined cargo of 313.3 million tons transited the Suez
Canal during the first quarter of 2022"

The implication is people are fools, never had or can have extra
wisdom on governance as they are easily led by the nose one way or
another. Want better resuls? Lead better.

Culture Codes can and are frequently used to influence voters who can
end up voting for stuff that are against their interests. Culture is
in emotional brain, stronger in effect than the analytic.  That's how
successful ads work too. An ad that highlights the IDENTITY it will
bring to its American owner will sell better than an ad which talks
about the technical specifications of a car.

---

Not only did DM help cement the culture war in US to divert attention
from real issues, he achived the same result in the United Kingdom. If
there was a psyop agent that aimed to undermine common people's
interests, it's this guy. In both cases he ended up helping the
well-to-do, the rich oligarchy by creating a smokescreen, so they hid
behind it while others yelled at eachother on bizarre issues and/or
at organizations such as the EU.

Dick Morris [again](2021/10/all-too-human.html#triangulation),
providing services on another hot-button division, playing on cultural
rifts, engaging in dubious voter manipulation.

"UKIP's triumphal march in England and Wales began in 2004. However,
arguably this 'Cinderella story' would not have materialised without
Dick Morris, who helped UKIP with its slogans, and simplified the
essential message in 2003 – this can be considered as the second
turning point.  Morris’ aim was to mobilise the anti-EU -citizens and
UKIP’s slogan was simplified to 'Say NO'; this phrasing left it to the
individual to contemplate their subjective dissatisfaction towards the
EU without UKIP putting words or arguments into their mouths. The use
of Morris’ service cost UKIP £2.36 million, but the spending enabled
UKIP to rise from sidelines to the mainstream.. As far as word choices
in the official documents are concerned, they are arguably practical,
easily understandable, appealing and easy for 'the man in the street'
to identify with"

"@JustinTLogan

The smart US play would have used the Zeitenwende as an opportunity to
hand Europe off to the Europeans. Sending 20k additional US troops to
Europe makes me think that’s not what we’re going to do

FT: 'Is the west’s increased defence spending even necessary?'"

Talks of intl criminal law? Make sure to start proceedings on US
crimes in Hiroshima, Nagasaki and the firebombing of Tokyo..
