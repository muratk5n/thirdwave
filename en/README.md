"@RadioFreeTom

Breitbart is running a piece that says - I am not kidding - that the
left is mocking the unvaxed so they'll dig in and never get vaxed and
die and shift political power to the left"

Bitcoin could have benefited from the artificially high attention
liberterians get in the thought-sphere as well.. Bright shiny object
tech will always have libtards to cheer for them, but BTC tech
probably benefited more from the presence of useful idiots.

---

The mystique is mostly for marketing. The tech is kludgy, not fit to
be a currency in the way its maximalists dream about. Glad it was
created, but have to move on. The gold-replacement angle definitely is
a no-go as gold itself could not serve that function.

"But he wasn't Satoshi, he was Satoshi's friend". Sure. Like "I have a
friend who does not think that's true". I am not saying it.. My friend says it.

The face looks too generic. I have a [picture of Satoshi](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_szmPgXIAMHAF8?format=jpg&name=small),
you could have used that.

Sucks to do politics in Russia

NYT: "[RU] new mansions are encroaching on the lakeshore, despite its
status as a national park... Ms. Makarova insisted that she was no
revolutionary and simply wanted everyone to follow the law. The bigger
issue, she said, was that most Russians fear getting involved in
politics because of the country’s bloody history. As a result, she
said, people with access to the levers of power easily take advantage
of those who don’t. 'Because of these huge cataclysms that happened to
their families, people realized that nothing depends on them, on
little people,' Ms. Makarova said. 'You will survive if you do not
interfere.'"

It's a legit legislation-fu IMO. As long as the shit doesn't hit the fan.

The Daily Beast: "Schumer surely concluded that some of his fellow
Democrats are hesitant to vote for a debt limit increase—and he did
not want to risk their opposition bringing down the entire must-pass
reconciliation bill. Moving the debt limit to regular legislation with
a 60-vote threshold allows Schumer to deflect attention from his own
party’s hesitancy, and instead blame Republican senators for not
bailing his party out"
