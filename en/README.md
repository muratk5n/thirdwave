Raising the retirement age? It needs to be lowered, as in, down to
18.

Noone should work bcz they have to. There is plenty of f-ing money -
govs will find it when they have to. They happily sink over a trillion
into a lackluster fighter plane, they surely can find some of it for
regular people.

That's like saying you can free yourself from the burdens of life by
making seatbelts non-mandatory, letting the market decide, and die
when the market wants.

French PM once said ‚Äúhelping everyone to free themselves through work
is a value of the left‚Äù.. ü§£ Yeah.

Borne is supposedly from "leftist" but sadly now turned into window
dressing for anti-left policies... The NYT piece is probably psyop
designed to generate symphathy for her so we forget about the recent
protests against the goverment trying to raise retirement age..

Borne... "

It's not possible to be culturally Catholic in a Protestan majority
country and vica versa. Your codes will not allow it. If you try too
hard to be some other thing you will become neurotic. This word is
associated with certain subgroup but there is Italian neuroticism too,
in quotes obviously "Italian" - same for Polish, and others. First
generation children and their descendants need to understand this
clearly - that fureign fuck talking shit with an accent (your elders)
is not similar to you. It's sad, but that is the truth.

---

Culture is transmitted at young age, subconciously, via osmosis -
through a land and its people, one on one, not through education,
stories, belief, or self-declaration.

All migrants are assimilated in one generation; the Turks in Anatolia
were no exception. Their initial culture is gone - almost nothing of
it remains. A form of language is around due to adminstrative,
military reasons, but that language is changed beyond recognition to
the extent that Anatolians today cannot understand "their cousins" in
Asia.

threats..  Once-secret ammunition bunkers and barracks lay abandoned,
empty and overrun by weeds ‚Äî vestiges of.. largest overseas [US] naval

the near future. The US has been taking steps to [return to] the
Philippines more than 30 years after the closure of its large bases in
the country"
