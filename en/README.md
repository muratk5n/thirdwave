Vessel has 1,250 m3 capacity carries gas cooled to -253°C and
liquefied to less than 800 times its gaseous volume.

For its production fossil (coal) turned into clean fuel and
transported cleanly. A historic day indeed.

H2 View: "In what has been described as a historic day for Japan,
Australia and the global energy industry, the world’s first liquid
hydrogen carrier last week left the Port of Victoria and started its
journey to Kobe, Japan...

Designed by Kawasaki Heavy Industries, the carrier will safely
transport large quantities of liquid hydrogen produced in Australia
from Latrobe Valley coal and biomass via gasification"

IEA: ""Globally, 142 bcm of natural gas was flared in 2020 – roughly
equivalent to the natural gas demand of Central and South
America. This resulted in around 265 Mt CO2, nearly 8 Mt of methane
(240 Mt CO2-eq) and black soot and other GHGs being directly emitted
into the atmosphere. Five countries (Russia, Iraq, Iran, the United
States and Algeria) accounted for more than half of all volumes flared
globally in 2020"

That number can definitely tip the balance; at least on ATW per tank.

That might have been the freakiest integration by parts application
I've ever seen.. On a double-integral, outside-in, one IBP for one
term, another for another term. Test function cancels out nicely and
boom.. Impressive.

It wouldn't make sense for Tories to drop Johnson before the next
election; otherwise they will look more of a party in chaos. BJ
leaving would cap a period with two PMs gone previously having been
destroyed by Brexit, with BJ being a third, that could be too one too
many PMs gone. After displaying sufficient anger, frustration, fury
(!) with the situation, they are better off letting the PM stay.

No country who can do CSP / solar, should go for nuclear. Especially
in the EU.

Nukes are "mildly toleratable" category for me, not "will support with
a glee" category.

They say that, but then there is the underlying culture, very hard to
change.. I heard an incident dude screaming at his fellow passanger
for graduating from Eton and telling him so. Quite recently. Or when a
director looks at an actor immediately labels him 'posh'. And well
there still are still the royals aren't there? For some people Queen
feeding those ducks in a ceremony is still a big deal.

"But Brits say class is not an issue anymore"

---

UK's culture code for itself is CLASS (whereas in US it is DREAM)..A
lot of issues are probably perceived through the prism of
class... Parties made PM look high-society, posh class.

"Portugal’s ruling centre-left Socialists won an outright parliamentary
majority in Sunday’s snap general election, securing a strong new
mandate for the prime minister, Antonio Costa.

The result, boosted by a higher than expected turnout despite the
coronavirus pandemic, came as a surprise after the Socialists had lost
most of their advantage in recent opinion polls. It means Portugal
will have a stable government to oversee the application of EU
pandemic recovery funds"

I see no reason for picking fights with fossil folk.  As long as there
is no fracking, (natgas) flaring to generate the stuff, and they are
not preferred over the green option, fossil-to-H2 is fine, great even,
it will generate plenty revenue for them as it does generate plenty of
energy for the consumers.

---

Heard Macron talk abt self-sufficiency, so that line of reasoning
probably doesnt jive with the Krauts. For energy they'd go to Russia,
to Africa, whatever, they'll find it, and trade it, create relations
over it.

---

I read somewhere once that post-WWII German intl relations *wants* to
create dependencies with other countries. Bcz of the experience of the
war, how its internal politics led to that, the country (its gov
strata) feels safer to be bound in a web of relationships, the EU
being the mother of them all. Germany loovees being in the
EU. Interesting angle.

Around 2008 gasoline price was much higher, but inflation never went

Alfred Nobel never wanted an econ prize, his relatives say [kill it](2018/05/faux-nobel.md)
today. Rabid speculators like Sholes won it before, 1997, a year before his
hedge fund would crash using his "Nobel level" techniques, causing bunch
of collateral damage around it. 

---

Much remains to do in econ. Until some natural sciences level stuff is
achieved, the Nobel Prize for econ needs to be canceled.

Real potential GDP, in FRED `GDPPOT` is being tracked / calculated?
Very cool.. For ppl who like to play with such variables there is a
wealth of data out there.

Trump himself often talked about low rates. He is a supply-sider basically. As
a businessman he likes cheap money, plus an obscene demand for
real-estate wouldn't hurt either, an indirect side-effect of ultra low
rates. But his company didn't see the 2008 subprime crisis coming
(they were about to go into the mortgate business right before it
happened), have to state that. At the very least we need the other side
of that trade, some ppl has to be for higher rates so the average is saner.

Taylor Rule as in the economist John Taylor who Trump briefly
considered as a FED chief; JT apparently [scared the market](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/27/possible-trump-fed-chair-nominee-john-taylor-scares-the-market.html)
at the time, he would of course, C'mon following a
formula, raise when it says so? We can't have that shit! FOMO monkeys
woud not like that. They like the parteh, dont want anyone to take the punch away.
JT wld have likely raised in 2018, but Powell did too of course, and we
all saw what happened, FOMO had their worst nightmare come alive, they
had a collective epileptic seizure.

I ran the code again, it gives a fedfunds at around 5.0 for today.

Reshare from 2016

There is the so-called Taylor Rule that calculates an optimal level
for the FED funds rate The
formula is,

$$
FF_t = r^\ast + \pi_t + 0.5(\pi_t - \pi^\ast ) + 0.5 Gap_t
$$



which is a simple relationship between inflation, an ideal rate, and
GDP. Ideal rate $r^\ast$ is assumed to be 2.0, $\pi_t$ is current
inflation, $\pi^\ast$ is target inflation, $Gap_t$ is the difference
between real and potential GDP.

[Result](2019/05/stats.md#taylor)

The graphs are somewhat close, but they diverge at certain points. For
example during the 80s (Volcker years) the FF rate was much higher
than necessary. In the early 2000s, Taylor Rule prescribes higher
rate, but FF was much lower. Lower-than-necessary rates was one of the
main causes of the subprime crisis, as everyone knows. 2009 is weird,
here Taylor Rule says "go negative" - and this is precisely the time
when "unconventional monetary programs" were started such as QE.

This is the huge mistake of goldcucks, Bitcoiners. Their system isn't
just utopic, its econ basis is crooked. It's basically spurred by
bunch of rich people who do not want to see their money "debased" wout
thinking of the side effects.

---

Yes bank credit is printed money, brought into existence out of thin
air.. Just type bunch of numbers on a computer, boom. New money. There
is good reason for creating money and not simply lending out savings;
If only savings were lent out, and businesses did well with that
credit, econ wld grow, well, then the money base did not change along
with that growth, same money chasing after more products, deflation.
