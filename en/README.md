Woke has history.. Post 9/11 there was Jack Bauer, James Blonde,
Bourne beating up on 'terrorists'.. After Iraq mishaps, crisis, there
was partial return to normality, some backlash, minor Woke - not too

kind of realization set it, then we had mega backlash, mega
Woke. Recent commentary here have mostly been on this last phase.
We are in it, sadly.

sanctions the single -largest commodity producer of the world, which
sells virtually everything"
