political terms. Trinkets, non-issue issues.

Dems experience it, but the intra-party problem hit the Reps
too. Being more hierarchical, they had pos walk in a single-file on
ideology for a while, but now, they have a former President who said
stuff against forever wars, and a lot of muckers who still want to
invade countries, forever. How can you war and anti-war in the same
party?

In UK, Oz, and many other places, libs, and other major ideologies
have their own party. Not so in US which IMO increase intra-party
friction. Most of my related posts are US centric. Beware.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
