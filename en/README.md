IHS Markit: "Germany fast tracks proposal for Norwegian blue and green
hydrogen pipeline.. Norway is seeking to 'rapidly' firm up plans to
export blue and green hydrogen it produces to Germany, potentially via
a pipeline that would rival one being developed in Denmark... The
nations jointly agreed to conduct a feasibility study at a 16 March
meeting between Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre, Norwegian
Petroleum and Energy minister Terje Aasland, and German Minister of
Trade and Industry Jan Christian Vestre"

The Hydrogen Standard: "The prospects for green hydrogen have been
given a boost as a market landgrab by oil and gas majors
continues. June has seen BP and TotalEnergies buying stakes in
projects with a combined production capacity of 2.6 million tonnes a
year. BP said it was taking operating rights and 40.5% stake in the
Asian Renewable Energy Hub, a planned 26 GW renewable energy complex
in Pilbara, Western Australia, Upon completion, the hub should be able
to deliver 1.6 million tonnes ofgreen hydrogen a year, BP
said. TotalEnergies, meanwhile,said it was taking a stake in Adani New
Industries Limited of India, which is aiming to produce a million
tonnes ofgreen hydrogen a year by 2030.

While the announcements clearly show oil majors are warming to green
hydrogen,the industry has not yet given up on more controversial blue
synthesis. Saudi Aramco said in its sustainability that it intends to
produce 11 million tonnes of low-carbon ammonia by 2030, which would
require million tonnes of blue hydrogen.

Nevertheless, the extent to which oil companies are backing green
hydrogen production is helping to turbocharge the growth of the
industry. In May, Research firm Reports it expected the green hydrogen
market to grow from 300m in 2020 to 9.8bn dollars in 2028, a CAGR of
almost 55%.

'The investments committed by BP and TotalEnergies confirm the
industry's confidence in hydrogen technology.' said analyst firm Wood
Mackenzie's vice president Prakash Sharmain a press note. 'After a
100-fold jump in low carbon hydrogen project announcements over
thepast three years, major energy players now seem willing to raise
green investments'

Having oil and gas majors battle it out for market dominance is pretty
much the best thing that could happen to green hydrogen, not just
because of the massive war chests that these companies possess—
bloated further by recent fuel price rises—but also becasue their
vertically integrated operations allow them to improve distribution
and end use of the fuel.

It is becoming clear that the oil industry intends to dominate green
hydrogen production similar to its dominance in fossil fuels. Having
made estimated '$100bn in the first quarter of this year alone, they
are better placed than anyoneto drive growth in the sector"

H2 Central: "Germany and the United Arab Emirates will hold further
talks on hydrogen and clean energy this week as the European country
seeks long-term solutions to wean itself off Russian gas in the wake
of Moscow’s attack on Ukraine...

The OPEC member is investing in the production of blue hydrogen, which
is made from natural gas in a process that captures carbon emissions
instead of allowing them to be released into the atmosphere"

H2 View: "German hydrogen-powered truck revealed.. Clean Logistics
unveiled its new hydrogen-powered truck to the public at Stade Airport
in Lower Saxony, Germany. Dubbed, Fyuriant, the model is powered by
two 120kW PRISMA fuel cell systems, developed by Shanghai-based REFIRE
technologies, providing a milestone for the two companies who hope to
usher in a new era of clean road freight transport.

The new truck is equipped with a fuel tank which can carry 43kg of
compressed hydrogen, with the truck offering a range of over 400km,
with a refuelling time of less than 15 minutes, the company said"

Hey I hope this transition happens. The current energy shortage could
still have been avoided though... Timely investment in H2 and CCS
would have guaranteed enough supply of clean fuel no matter the
primary energy source. Transition could have been smooth. Instead we
are in a street-fight.

"In the first quarter of 2022, Spain already comprised 20 percent of
the green hydrogen projects worldwide. That placed it in second place
behind only the United States, where over half the projects were
located, according to data from consulting firm Wood Mackenzie"

Forbes: "George Noble started his career at Fidelity Investments in
the early 1980s working for stockpicking legend Peter Lynch, then
running the top-performing Fidelity Overseas Fund.. The broad market
downturn so far is just the beginning. 'This decline will shock,' he
says. 'Interest rates and yields are going higher. Equities are
toast.' There will be no soft landing. 'They’re not going to get
inflation down until the economy breaks,' but the Fed has no
choice. 'If they don’t raise rates, we’re on the road to Weimar.' He’s
referring of course to the hyperinflation of Weimar Germany, where by
1923 goods cost a trillion times more than five years prior"

For a long time Chinese (and most of the world) have been moving
forward in an auto-pilot mode on grand innovation direction. Leave it
to the Americans to try out the long-term trends, directions, you just
take the idea, implement it better. Can't argue with the cost side, it
could more profitable simply to follow. But US errs, and in past few
decades errs big. The dream machine is generating too much junk, tech
direction is relying on too many stupid people. I believe more than a
few countries started to realize this situation

Just because something has "electric", "electromagnetic" in its name
doesn't mean that thing is better. Gases, liquids, perform many
functions perfectly well, and they are reliable. This is true for fuel
as it is for power generation, heating, or cooling, or in this case,
launching an entire aircraft.

Wiki: "The Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) is a type of
aircraft launching system.. [developed for] the United States
Navy. The system launches carrier-based aircraft by means of a
catapult employing a linear induction motor rather than the
conventional steam piston.. a highly critical 2018 report from the
Pentagon..  emphasized that reliability of EMALS leaves much to be
desired and that the average rate of critical failures is nine times
higher than the Navy's threshold requirements"

Super carrier Gerald Ford is scaling a relatively new technology to

Politico: "Germany gets tough on Brexit.. New German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz has Boris Johnson firmly in his sights.. German officials say
there is cross-party consensus in Germany on the need to protect the
EU single market — the destination of about 70 percent of German
exports — but acknowledged Berlin has dialled up the rhetoric in
recent weeks.. Berlin has also judged this is the appropriate time to
send a 'blunter' message that the U.K. must abandon any ambitions to
rewrite the protocol, they added. Germany also wants to dispel any
suggestion that the row is merely an issue between the U.K. and
Ireland only"

There is also that pile of cash the US froze; bondholders can ask US
to be paid from that stash.

CNBC: "Russia has entered its first major foreign debt default for
over a century, after a grace period on two international bond
payments lapsed on Sunday night... The Kremlin has rejected the claim
that Russia is in default..  telling a press call this morning that
Russia made the bond payments due in May but they have been blocked by
Euroclear due to Western sanctions, rendering the non-delivery of
payments 'not [Russia’s] problem.'"

UKR did not implement Minsk agreements, and sent bombing sorties
toward Russian seperatists with those little toy planes from
"Britain's other bitch" causing damage on equipment.. All with the
support of US/UK. You poked the bear and now the bear is coming for
you. What were they thinking?

---

"Support Ukraine" rhetoric is also partly there to cover up previous
fuck ups of the West, especially of Britain and US. If we treat UKR
gov as good capable leaders only lacking some weapons under the attack
of a mean Russia, then their mistakes get erased, forgotten

The Guardian: "Even today, there is some dissension in the west about
what the objectives in Ukraine should be. In contrast to the leaders
of the Baltic states, Poland, and the United Kingdom, the French
president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, are
not committed to ensuring that Russia is defeated militarily, and the
Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has proposed a peace framework,
with an immediate ceasefire at the top of the agenda"

"@DanDePetris

Politicians who are so opposed to settling the war in Ukraine should
do their due diligence and consider an even uglier contingency: Russia
gains more ground as the war proceeds, cements those gains"

Foreign Policy: "[Gabbard, Davis] As much as Ukraine welcomes every
piece of equipment, however, the deliveries have been a clunky mixture
of modern and antiquated, Western and Soviet. Numerous systems require
specialized training, specific maintenance systems, and ammunition of
various calibers that are often mutually exclusive to each weapon
system. All of this requires a massive and complicated logistics
system to keep the weapons supplied and functioning—one that doesn’t
currently exist in Ukraine and continues to be improvised...

Policies in Kyiv and Washington seem to ignore these battlefield
realities... While there is still time, and Kyiv still controls 80
percent of its territory, a change in U.S. policy would provide a
chance to save Ukrainian lives and prevent further territorial
losses. At minimum, the Biden administration should de-emphasize
its goals of weakening Russia and instead prioritize diplomacy,
helping Kyiv and Moscow find a negotiated end to the war"
