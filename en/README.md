WaPo: "The Big Tech companies that won dominance of the internet
brought in billions of dollars a year, spending it on eye-popping
salaries, gleaming offices and constant acquisition of smaller
companies.

But the past year of rising interest rates and falling stock prices
has shaken the industry, along with the San Francisco Bay region it
dominates. Now, tens of thousands of layoffs from Google, Microsoft,
Amazon, Facebook and dozens of other companies have made it clear: The
golden age is over. Speeches about austerity have replaced the
free-flowing stock grants and free sushi lunches"

"[A]s of 2023, open source really has won. There are more Unix-like
OSes than ever, and some very un-Unix-like OSes which are highly
compatible with it, but the official line [about Unix's death] is, to

commercial Unixes are now on life support: they will get essential bug
fixes and security updates, but we won't be seeing any major new
releases.

Send flowers. ®"
