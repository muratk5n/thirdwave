It's good but eventually I'd just remove the battery, dead-end
dead-weight tech, just run on the HFC.

That is absolutely true.. An incremental, one-step change in a largely
useless direction. Perfect example of 'getting stuck at local minima'
I talked about. The one-step change marketed to office-dwelling
limpdicks who "like" electricity (they can see the wall plug at
home/work, it looks sterile, 'clean', 'magical' unlike fuels which are
mostly, like, ew).  The sale was done on the basis of "we'll make that
magical thing 'green' for you by taking your cool laptop's battery and
put it on the car.  Despite appearances office dwelling limpdicks were
too uninformed or too fucking dumb to realize such approach could not
scale.

Obviously the implication below is people are morons, and that is
mostly true. But more than that, they are just busy. They have other
things to worry about, jobs, family, which take time. Politics,
statecraft is a profession. Just like you cant form an opinion on your
root canal and replace your dentist by 'following the media' cant do
the same for statecraft. People vote on their well-being, on the
incumbent, based on a few (three) general parameters which is enough
for democracy. The rest is rationalizations to sound cool around the
water-cooler on a decision that was already made on a much more baser
level. This analysis is offputting for some, further away than a
Renaissance society they dreamt about but it's life. The sights and
people we saw on Jaywalking are not the exception, or even an American
phenomenon, they are the rule.

Issue polls don't matter much.. People voting for representatives who
dont care about gun control proves it. The issue's existence is dog
whistle for Rep elite survival, which matters. The gun issue can only
be fixed among representatives themselves (if changed they'll sell the
new position to the public who will follow, repeat the justifications
fed to them by the media), and that can only happen if the issue is
hot-button issue no more. Dems messed this up, they need to fix it.

support and repeated outrage over mass shootings"

Israel and the Arab states were establishing relations, the killing of
the journalist complicates that, which could be the reason why it was
done. Thawing of relations could help the Palestine cause, maybe at
some point 'the new neighbors' would push for a Palestian state?  We
can't have that!

---

That's the other thing; people are locked up in a prison-like system
behind walls, *but* Israel needs workers, so people go through
checkpoints daily to work in Israel. Got walls, but we need workers,
and oh, also, we want to settle behind that wall, inside settlements
which themselves are behind walls. The situation is obnoxiously
stupid. I think deep down Israelis believe Palestenians will just
disappear somehow and they'll have the land all for themselves.

If Palestine had a stand-up comedy culture, its comedians would never
go without work. There is a wealth of material out there.

Jenin, the place where that poor female journalist was killed
recently, is in northern West Bank. Jenin is obviously behind the
wall, but still under military occupation. Extremely low income,
workers from there have to pass through checkpoints, with permits, to
enter Israel to work.

---

Gaza and the West Bank are both surrounded by walls, yet there is a
military occupation in the West Bank. One would think the walls would
create a de-facto Palestian state already. Egypt takes Gaza, West Bank
could declare statehood, w East Jerusalem as the capital. But the
settlements make that route impossible. Israel wants to have its cake
and eat it too. Isolate people behind walls, but then settle in their
land, that's where the need for 'extra protection' comes from.

FT: "[B]ehind the confident rhetoric, there is much less clarity about
what Washington actually believes can and should happen in
Ukraine. There is little detail about what a strategic defeat for
Russia would actually look like or what sort of territorial settlement
the US might end up encouraging the Ukrainians to accept...

But at the same time, it is trying to hold together an international
coalition in support of Ukraine that includes some European allies who
worry loudly and openly about the impact of a long protracted war,
both on Ukraine and its society and on their own economies.

In recent weeks, the leaders of France, Germany and Italy have all
made statements encouraging some sort of ceasefire and negotiated
settlement"
