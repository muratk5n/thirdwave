The only criticism I had on Lula in the past was handling of his
succession.. Looking at the no-holds-barred nature of Brazil's
politics, IMHO, he should've picked someone feisty, gregarious, knows
economics, and a guy - basically younger version of himself. He picked
the former guerilla hot chica, it didn't work out too well. Dilma was
fine but the aftermath proved otherwise.. I don't think the schemin,
cretin muckers of Brazil politics could've pulled off what they did on
Lula himself when he was president. Once the institutional left in BR
is stronger, diversity is good.

That sounded like half-way concession \#Bolsonaro

Too many headlines with "migrant boat sank in the Medi". Are they
*being sunk* by shadowy operators from coastal countries?

Wisdom of the crowds works when the decision is commensurate to the
knowledge of the crowd. For a very tough medical diagnosis the
combination of 10 cardiologists can work better than one. But 1
million random people cannot make a decision worth even one good
doctor.

Voters indirectly contribute into governance.. when they vote their
pocket, on the incumbent, they can indirectly vote in the person (who
should have different policy set) that can fix their problem. It's all
crab walk, sideways, indirect. No need to read too much into it (or
expect much from it).

FBI master crime NIBRS dataset, has 45 mil records for one year, and

H2 View: "Turquoise hydrogen made from pyrolysis is efficient, clean
and potentially even carbon negative, according to a ‘Pyrolysis:
Potential and possible applications of a climate friendly hydrogen
production’ report.

The report, from Hydrogen Europe in collaboration with the German
Technical and Scientific Association for Gas and Water (DVGW), was
published this week to coincide with European Hydrogen Week...

Its appeal is that it can be installed at point of use wherever there
is methane, thereby avoiding large infrastructure CAPEX, and it uses
minimal electricity, making it “more competitive” than green hydrogen
in a high electricity price environment"
