"Revolutionary liquid hydrogen tanker to scale hydrogen adoption in the
mobility market.. C-Job Naval Architects has.. co-designed [the
vessel] with LH2 Europe.. [which] is.. equipped with three liquid
hydrogen storage tanks with a total capacity of 37,500m3.. [the plan
is] to initially deliver 100 tons per day (t/d) of green hydrogen and
ramp up production to 300 t/d within three years, depending on demand"

H2 View: "ArcelorMittal carries out successful hydrogen-derived DRI
[iron processing] in Canada..  [T]he company integrated green hydrogen
into the production of direct reduced iron (DRI) providing a new
market in which the Canadian hydrogen sector can explore. As part of
the test, the company assessed the ability to replace the use of
natural gas with green hydrogen within the iron ore reduction
process. The first test, 6.8% of natural gas was replaced with green
hydrogen during a 24-hour period, which is said to have contributed to
a measurable reduction in carbon emissions"

Undoubtedly an H2 based economy will play into the strengths of some
new players who can reach sunshine regions easier then they could
reach oil/gas rich regions, and import energy cleanly through
renewable fuels. US was the king of an earlier era, it had the natural
resources, and the military to get to OPP (other people's
petroleum). But we cannot keep the existing system forever.. The world
needs more energy, and climate change threatens to destroy us all. I
believe renewable fuels will democratize the use of energy and make
everyone richer. Power dynamics will change but that cannot be helped.

Mozarella dries very fast - 2 hrs tops at 80 C.

Video on making pemmican. Runs dried meat through blender.

One idea is blending right after cooking, it would be easier,
especially for poultry, one can mix anything in at that stage too,
veg, fruit, spices in raw form. Then dry that whole mix; cooked pieces
seperate easier during dehyd bcz previous blending already cut
everything into little pieces.

"Cancel the debt then change the system" - that comment from before
sounded conflated, actions with political ideologies..  What is
described would be the outcome, the long-run result of right-left
back-and-forth oscillation, not one party doing it all.

---

Right-wing wouldn't remove functional programs. Look at Canada. They
had a few conservative governments since the enactment of single-payer
(Tommy Douglas!). Were they removed? No.

---

Actually the permanent policy of left should be to *always* cancel the
student debt whenever they are in power. I bet that would encourage
the right to abollish those programs **pronto** when the can; and
that's fine too, the left can then later enact less market-intrusive
programs, they'd remain (bcz they'd f-ing work).

'Morgage stress'? But lower house prices would translate into lower
rent prices in a few years.. Renters don't matter? In Oz home owners
do not dominate as I understand even with historically (bcz low rates
create a flurry of activity pushing the home prices up so high most
cannot affor them even with low rates).

---

Rates can go up just like they can go down.. it's party of a cycle.
There is nothing ultimately right or wrong about it..

The Mandarin: "[Oz] Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe said the board
believed it was the right time to start pulling back the support it
has given to the economy during the pandemic."

There is no deying that. But Nazis also created some fringe benefits;
would the US Apollo program be possible without Wernher von Braun?  He
developed his trade while building rockets for Nazis. If there is no
space program there are no additional inno that comes from
it. Scratch-resistant lenses, teflon, velcro.. Have a funky sport shoe
with velcro? You can thank the Nazis for that. You can thank the Brits
for..  some institutions here and there, fine.

"Britain's presence in some countries helped their democratic
institutions"

---

Do I think Brits caused as much damage as Nazis? That's probably
true... The partition in India alone caused 1 million deaths. That was
done for strategic reasons, it didn't have to be done, but it was done
so UK could meddle easier in the region's affairs. Tally it all up
maybe you could reach the number of Jews killed by the Nazis.

Current cultural and genetic make-up of Anatolia is overwhelmingly
local. Similar people, culture have been in the land for at last ten
thousand years, not a few hundred, or even thousand years. They are
not foreigners in their own land. Tigger nationalists are lying cunts.

---

For the outers having the Turkist ideology active in Anatolia was
useful; it reinforced an 'outpost' mentality among the
locals. Followers of the ideo foolishly believe they 'just' arrived,
right? Hence they are constantly 'fighting to hold on to their new
home land', they see everyone around them as enemies. That is useful
for the outers, here is a guy on guard, fearing every near neighbor,
well then they would be more willing to ask 'friendly' outers for
help, include them in their affairs more, wouldn't they?
