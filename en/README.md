Attributing wins / loses due to this or that voter choice is a tough
task. My rule-of-thumb is the eye-squinting method (blur your vision

Dem shitlibs in US looove the war in Ukraine. Finally they have a good
guy against Russia they can identify with. During Syrian war allies on
their side were Al Qaida types, they had freaking beards, names like
Habib, Abdul.. F-ing Mostafa.. Nah.. That didn't work. But European
looking people as good guys, against Russia Russia Russia..?  Now

NYT: "A disagreement has emerged at the highest levels of the United

Staff, has made the case in internal meetings that the Ukrainians have
achieved about as much as they could reasonably expect on the
battlefield before winter sets in and so they should try to cement
their gains at the bargaining table"
