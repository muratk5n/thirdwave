H2 Central: "Photocatalytic water splitting technology.. [was]
developed over five years by the two universities. During this period,
they progressed their understanding and designs of a solar reactor
which utilises the sun’s radiation and thermal properties to increase
reaction efficiencies beyond the baseline performance of a
photocatalyst material.

Key elements of the technology.. include the use of the entire solar
spectrum to enhance reaction efficiencies along with incorporating
concentrated solar radiation via mirror reflectors. Solar
concentration increases temperature in the solar reactor, which has
been shown to increase reaction efficiencies, while allowing for a
reduction in the amount of photocatalyst material required for a given
production rate.

This technology significantly reduces the need for wind farms or
massive arrays of solar panels that are required for traditional
electrolysis, which is expected to reduce costs substantially"

H2 View: "African countries embrace hydrogen as ‘second era’ climate
financing kicks in.. African countries are busy embracing hydrogen and
other clean energies as a ‘second era’ of climate financing is
underway, according to discussions on Finance Day at COP27
today... 'The energy picture is changing, and in five years' time, the
share of hydrogen will be much bigger than it is today – and that
requires lots of investment and collaboration.' [said an Abu Dhabi
Bank official]"

Investor Tchir is saying FTX fall could mean less purchase of mining
rigs (less demand on microprocessors -good-) less ad spending. Less
ads with Matt Damon telling us 'march off and do something exciting'
(he said that very disparagingly), and finally we will see less energy
use as mining drops - great.

CNN: "Sam Bankman-Fried, the crypto entrepreneur known for providing a
financial lifeline to struggling firms in the industry, is now in need
of a bailout himself... SBF, started this week firmly in the realm of
billionaires, with an estimated fortune of more than $15 billion,
according the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. After the collapse of his
crypto exchange, FTX, in a matter of days he may find himself out of
the club"
