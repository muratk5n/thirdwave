Notice when they were hitting Corbyn with that how the narrative also
came coupled with a pro-Russia "accusation".  It may not have made
sense at first, such talk in a country who was "on the right side" of
WWII fighting against the Nazis being so enthusiastic to prove its
anti-Semitic credentials, but once we understand Israel's role in the
outer alliance (a frontier country) it all makes sense; Accusing
someone being pro-Russia and anti-Semitic is merely different sides of
the same coin.

Pro-ISR stance in UK (and US) is a secret handshake of sorts.. Instead
of saying 'I am wholeheartedly supportive of my country's long-running
strategy of containing the inner countries, block their access to the
high seas and position selves so we can choke off their trade at a
moment's notice" you just say "I dislike anti-Semitism and will repeat
that 100 more times just to make sure you get ðŸ˜‰ my ðŸ˜‰ meaning ðŸ˜‰".

Anti-semitism talk in UK politics doesn't have anything to do with
anti-semitism per se, it has everthing to do with signaling loyalty to
the interest of the outer alliance.

I wonder if shadowy figures in US delibaretely targeted Greece post
2008 so they took on a ginormous debt; Goldman Sachs underwrote those
loans and they likely egged them on; as a result Greece was saddled
with an onerous contract, later US obtained military bases perhaps in
return for lenience, help? Who knows

train will ever need for multiple trips?

Financial Post: "Ballard Power Systems Inc., the Vancouver-based maker
of hydrogen fuel cells for use in trucks, trains and ships,... share
price jumped five per cent to $11.39, the highest point since early
May, extending a 33-per-cent surge since late July.. Investor
excitement appears.. connected to the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act,
which has a massive climate-change component that could allocate
billions of dollars to incentivize the construction of hydrogen
infrastructure...

Suddenly, in a major and largely unexpected shift, the bill has
positioned the United States to emerge as a major hydrogen economy and
a potentially lucrative market for Ballard products. 'It wasnâ€™t too
long ago, maybe two years ago, where the U.S. market really was not a
high priority for us,' [CEO] told analysts.. 'In fact, we had really
characterized the U.S. market as a California market. That has clearly
changed.'"
