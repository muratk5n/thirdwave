This is great news... I don't support forcing to take hijab off (the

It looks like RU doesn't want an incursion into Kurdish areas "from
the North" either. They essentially put their military between two
sides.

Aleppo, told AFP that Russian troop reinforcements had reached the
city"

Forbes: "Why are so many semiconductor chips used in cars?.. For
automobiles, the huge push for improvements in fuel economy after the
1973 oil crisis led to the rapid increase in the use of electronics in
engine controls. While electronic ignitions had started to appear in
the late 1960s, the use of microcontroller chips for engine controls
demonstrated what was possible with a digital approach. Using sensors
to monitor things like temperature, crankshaft position, mass air
flow, throttle position, and concentration of oxygen in the exhaust
gases, automakers were able to dramatically improve the fuel economy
and emissions profiles of their vehicles. The controller chips did
on-the-fly calculations to optimize engine performance, something that
was impossible to do with mechanical sensors and linkages"
