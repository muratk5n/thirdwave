Anatolians know the cheese as *tulum peyniri*; it is Romanian in

They bring bryndza cheese as appetizer along with *lavash* at kebab
houses in Anatolia; the cheese is heavy, dry, salty.. Thought can use
it on dried poultry as fat subtitute. Saw the making of this cheese,
they dry the hell out of it, all its water comes out.

"The rising cost of second-hand vehicles is a consequence of the
semiconductor chip shortage that's been hammering the motor industry
since Covid-19 lockdowns were first a thing. The short supply of chips
has bottlenecked car production, with outputs slumping by more than a
third as manufacturers struggle to get their hands on the much-needed
components. To put the scale of the problem into perspective,
approximately 40 chips of varying capabilities are needed for the
average family motor today, such is the substantial reliance of
electronics in the latest vehicles"

Politico: "Buried deep in a recent story about Arizona Republican
Senate candidate Blake Masters is a particularly revealing comment
from one of Masters‚Äô supporters, posted on an exclusive Discord chat:
'How can one man be so based?'. The uninitiated reader might be
forgiven for asking: 'Based on what?'  The word, a slang term with
origins in hip-hop culture, has been adopted in recent years by the
extremely online far right to basically mean 'anything that owns the
libs'.. He and his mentor, Peter Thiel, are fixated on the far-right
pet project of 'dismantling the administrative state,'"

Based on grav pull and volume one can show Sun's density is

former).

30-35 C temp indoors is comfortable, not a big deal.. The problem is
outdoors, pavements, per below. Temp measurements are taken in the
shade. Where sun *falls* on pavement is at a higher / temperature,
higher than that day's temperature. This is the root of the hellish
experiences, especially in cities. And.. most of our cities are just
bloody pavement right?

---

Good point

"Shade doesn't actually make temperatures cooler. Rather, being in
direct sunlight and solar radiation makes the air feel 10 to 15
degrees warmer than it actually is, said.. a retired weather service
meteorologist. 'So, conversely, it would feel that much cooler in the
shade,' he said. Similarly, when the  ocean breeze comes up,
temperatures will feel 4 to 5 degrees cooler, particularly if you've
been sweating. And if you're looking for yet another means to buffer
the outside heat, find some grass. It will feel a few degrees cooler
than the heat rising off of pavement"

Subsidies are absolutely fine. Gov can guide econ towards the
production of that food. Free markets by themselves are not enough.

Gobble gobble gov subsidizing 75% of gobble gobble farms for capacity
over 7000? Interesting.. The bird grows in half a year, so 140,000
birds a year, markets sell a kilo for 6 USD, say farms sell it for 3
USD a piece, 7000 x 2 x 4 x 3 = 168000 USD per year, since costs are
mostly subsidized, cld leave over 120K USD after subtracting costs..
Not bad for a farmer.

When expecting a crisis people rush to safe assets like treasury bonds
raising their price and lowering its yield - which foretells an
environment when FED rate will be lower due to crisis. It's fitting
how that works out.

* There‚Äôs a big recession coming (so people are desperate for safe assets).
