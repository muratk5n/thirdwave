H2 Fuel News: "A recent report in PV Magazine pointed to a green
hydrogen economy as Africaâ€™s best opportunity for unity and unity for
Africaâ€™s best opportunity to become powerful in renewable energy.  The
report showed that the potential from renewable power is great enough
that it could possibly help countries throughout the continent to
overcome the obstacles to using the sustainable resources that are
abundantly available there"

There's no innovation in crypto. It's centuries-old ideas painted as
new ones but with added blockchain fetishism. The end result, yet
again, will be a greater normalization of Ponzinomics"

Asking ppl for up and down vote on reprentatives, fine. Asking on
policy, not fine.

"In an unusual step, Mexico president asks voters if he should go"

Excessive love for immigration, wanting open-borders are likely a
distorted by-product of rabid liberalism with its focus on
individuality.. To them the immigrant is expressing his/her
individuality by choosing to come to a liberal country like US. They
want to fight for the immigrant just like they fight for people's
inalinable rights abroad and topple governments in their name (which
actually benefit oil and weapons producers but hey it's the intent
that counts). However such free love creates a point of contention
with tradiotionally left leaning labor as more people increase
competition for wages. Cesar Chavez, a Hispanic union leader [did not support](2021/03/ship-of-fools.md#chavez)
open borders.

How are unionizing efforts at Walmart? The Atlantic had an [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/how-walmart-convinces-its-employees-not-to-unionize/395051/)
on that in 2015.

BTW, Amazon is not the biggest in retail. Walmart is. 2018 retail sales,

Walmart	$387.66

Amazon.com  $120.93

The Kroger Co. $119.70

Great job. Leadership - it matters. Can't have a headless mob running amok
dancing on Tiktok hoping for a change.

Someone needs to look into that Roth IRA trick Focker pulled off to evade taxes.

People in this Paypal mafia are bizarre self-serving weirdos.

Focker always looked like a jagoff apparently.

The other is the e-battery e-jagoff before cosmetic make-over.

Another advantage of ranked-choice system over the two-round approach;
TRS cuts off the next round candidates at two. With RCS the third
candidate close to the second (and the first) might have shot up with
the help of people's 2nd, 3rd level choices. It's unlikely but possible.

If there was media that went beyond fan-fiction we'd have received
this info, but sadly objective coverage is AWOL

They might be lulling you into a false sense of security, don't fall
for it. In the meantime UKR is covering its military losses.

Covid could be an attack; Look at China, they act like they are under
siege, have a lockdown in the entire city of Shangai? Why are they not
quitting zero-covid? No mRNA vax for them? Maybe they don't trust it,
suspect bio targeting. It looks like a war.

New attacks in the ME are likely proxy attacks on US/NATO. As things
get worse between inners/outers, latest in Ukraine, places could be
targeted. The more the war lingers on, the more everyone will lose.
