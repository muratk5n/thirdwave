Break-even point for Avatar 2 was 1.4 billion.. What was the budget?

Can reverse engineer it from profit estimation; Profit P, Gross G,
Budget B, Marketing M, $ P = G - (B + M + 0.4 \cdot G) $ breakeven
means the $P=0$, marketing half the budget as before, $ 0 = G - (B +
\frac{B}{2} + 0.4 G)$ rearrange $0.4 G = B$, G=1400, then budget could
be ~560 million. A *lot* of money.. the GDP of a small island nation.

Hey people love the movie and it is making money. Great.

divisions on an economic issue, created less unity.. good. One side is
for the rich, the other side is, hopefully, for the poor. Better to
have arguments around econ than people getting worked up marginal,
secondaries, like gay-trans, vaginas, or an ass crack.
