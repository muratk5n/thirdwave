"France differs from the other European Union countries because it has
sovereignty interests in the region. More than 1.6 million French
citizens live in overseas territories there, and three-quarters of the
country’s exclusive economic zone — the second largest in the world —
is located there as well. France is not a spectator in the
Indo-Pacific, it is a resident power. Because of that, Australia will
remain a key partner in the South Pacific. Tensions may spike in the
short term, but the strategic partnership between the two countries
will endure"

"Deconstructing the administrative state".. Words like that should
freak everyone the f--k out. Until an alternative system arrives,
deconstructing what you have now is insane.. The world these muckers
envison would have low income ppl lose gov programs, see cuts to
social assistance, healthcare where you would have to ride a modified
exercise bike 12 hrs a day turning a pedal to mine bitcoins so you can
pay for your rent. Your small apt would be in a complex owned by the
oligapolies of the very cobsuckers that are asking for the said
deconstruction and inequality would run amok. You get sick?  No
problem: just inject diswasher liquid, eat chalk powder, you'll be
fine.. "You'll know what to do". 

Noone should actively seek for such a state of dysfunction, dystopia.

"The ambitions of [the Paypal mafia] have often gone hand in hand with
Thiel’s extremist libertarian political project: a reorganization of
civilization that would shift power from traditional
institutions—e.g., mainstream media, democratically elected
legislatures—toward startups and the billionaires who control
them. Thiel secretly funded the lawsuit that destroyed Gawker Media in
2016...

For Trump’s science adviser, Thiel suggested two climate change
deniers, Princeton physicist William Happer and Yale computer
scientist David Gelernter. For the head of the Food and Drug
Administration, Thiel offered, among other names, Balaji Srinivasan,
an entrepreneur with no obvious experience in government, who seemed
skeptical that the FDA should exist at all...

It’s illegal to use a Roth account to buy stock in a company you
control. And yet, starting in 1999, Thiel used a Roth to buy stock in
companies with which he was closely associated—including PayPal and
Palantir—for prices that were as low as a thousandth of a penny per
share. All the capital gains since then have been tax-free...

According to IRS rules, if a Roth IRA account holder engages in a
prohibited transaction—like using the money to invest in a company you
legally control—then that person loses the tax break for the entirety
of the portfolio’s value. In Thiel’s case that would mean he could be
on the hook for a tax bill in the billions"

I am giving extra points to any movie which does not use time travel or
