Europeans send their trash to Poland and companies there just burn it..?

APNews: "(2018) Polandâ€™s prime minister vowed tough measures Tuesday
to fight a string of illegal fires at garbage dumps and landfills that
has been producing hazardous smoke..

TV stations in Poland have been showing footage of huge clouds of
smoke billowing into the air from various dump sites, as firefighters
try to contain the situation"

Compsci = *computational* science, not computer science.

See how he talks about functions, data. "Coders" naturaly understand
this slant on AI albeit weak, bcz they know how to "run stuff",
functions (software has them too), so they can intuit the
approach. This view is one level above complete ignorance. The next
one requires compsci grok.

Could be GA.. The BTC code was officially turned over to his upkeep,
the last email sent from SN was to GA. His psych profile suggests an
overdeveloped sense of justice, seeing a lot of people wronged by the
finance system could push a person like that to act. Theres leadership
ability; being able to entice people to work in orgs, etc -- crucial
for an open-source project. Background suggests he would have more
knowledge than others (in that BTC group) on projects crafted for the
industry, he co-wrote the VRML standard so would know how to present
stuff for developer consumption.

There are other Satoshi N possibilities of course.. According to
[this](2021/09/satoshi-identification.md) analysis, Gavin Andresen is
the closest to SN, based on word frequency usage.
