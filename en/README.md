H2EG: "The landmark agreement [btw Shell and ZeroAvia] is expected to
be Europeâ€™s first with eyes on creating a 100-metre-long hydrogen
pipeline that will run alongside the ZeroAvia hangar... With this
development, a suitable hydrogen refuelling infrastructure will be in
place in order to establish hydrogen technologies at the airport
leading to further innovation within the aviation industry.

Oliver Bishop, General Manager of Hydrogen at Shell, said, 'Shell
recognises the aviation sector has unique challenges in
decarbonization and needs practical and scalable net-zero
solutions.. We believe ZeroAviaâ€™s technology is a viable option, and
this agreement will allow us to demonstrate successful provision of
low-carbon hydrogen supply while supporting development of codes,
standards, and refuelling protocols for hydrogen-powered aviation.'"

Aaand here is another port - great. 

H2 View: "Port of Duisburg and Port of Rotterdam to jointly develop
hydrogen hubs.. A letter of intent (LOI) has been agreed between the
Port of Rotterdam and the Port of Duisburg with plans to establish
hydrogen hubs in the surrounding areas of Germany and the Netherlands"

---

Rotterdam is a huge port sure, but still, there could be more, energy
cld be generated in Spain, Portugal, or imported into them from
anywhere in the Atlantic or NW Africa..

---

OK.. If Rotterdam will import 20 million tonnes of hydrogen (per year
I assume),


```python
print ('%d Gigawatts' % (33.6*20*1e6*1000/(1e6*365*24)))
```

```text
76 Gigawatts
```

That's pretty good... And that's just one port.

---

Europe imported 380 million cubic meters per day of gas by pipeline
from Russia in 2021. Natural gas has 10.55 kWh per cubic meters,

```python
print ('%d Gigawatts' % (10.55*380*1e6/(24*1000*1000)))
```

```text
167 Gigawatts
```

That is f--ing massive amt of energy; 167 nuclear plant worth of
energy right there. Dam

---

H2 View: "The Queensland Government has signed a Memorandum of
Understanding.. with the Port of Rotterdam to jointly develop green
hydrogen export supply chains... [Minister for Energy] said, 'This
landmark agreement is another ringing endorsement of Queenslandâ€™s
quest to be a green hydrogen superpower'. The Port of Rotterdam has a
target to import up to 20 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2050, starting
with imports of ammonia in 2025"

'No free-lunch' is a figure of speech (also a theorem in optimization).

In real-world it holds true. Most do not eat for free, but someone
else pays for it ;) Left can say that other person can be gov. The
government already pays for many things that pro-business folk take
for granted (and exist because of it). SValley makes use of the
presence of great professors whose research is paid by the government,
roads paved, energy infra created by the government, the security
provided by the government and the open-source software provided by
mostly nameless contributers around the world. Well it is easy to be
'wild and innovative' a budding entrepreneur in this scenario... being
the topping of the cake while making use of free. We need free.
