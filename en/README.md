RU has unbelivable advantages in the larger region; scanning the map
at first you see this thin slice of a land seperate from Moldova, and
wonder WTH is that? It is Transnistria, unrecognised breakaway state
with Russkies on it. Now Russian advance can attempt to connect to
that region.

---

RU already has all of Luhansk, a portion of Donetsk (the pink area on
the map). They are still advancing in Donetsk, there is shelling all
across the east and southern front.

There is also activity in southwest, towards Odessa. From the attack
patterns it looks like RU still intends to landlock Ukraine.

"A few weeks like this and the European economy will just go into a
full stop," [Belgian PM] told Bloomberg on Thursday. 'Recovering from
that is going to be much more complicated than intervening in gas
markets today. The risk of that is de-industrialization and severe
risk of fundamental social unrest.'"

The assasination of Diana was probably race-related. Then Meghan
Markle events were racism related.. For a country who "abolished
racism early" they sure have a lot of that over there, especially at
the top.

There was the talk of a "Kherson annexation referandum" a while
back. If it is pursued, and people there vote Ja on the Anschluss,
then they automatically become Russian citizens, and massive
mobilization to defend them could be in the offing.

I dont think Russia will leave what it considers crucial areas - the
land bridge to Ukraine, areas in Donbas.

The biggest downside of the royalty is they cement certain type of
Britain. After Brexit they asked Liz II 'what will happen to us now'?
She was like "well I'm still here". Royals have certain legitimacy
(perhaps Europe's institution were also a danger to that legitimacy)
so their very presence might lulled people thinking all is fine. Get
rid of Europe, who cares, we have an old lady who feeds ducks in an
elaborate ceremony.

"Britain's friends" are all connected.. One makes a gain, the other is
encouraged. Azeri prez's father came to power thanks to a "BP coup",
as in British Petroleum. The son plays all sides but Brits still roam
about and stir shit up.
