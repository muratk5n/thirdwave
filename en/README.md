ClassNK: "Tokyo - ClassNK has issued an Approval in Principle (AiP)
for an ammonia-fueled tugboat (A-Tug) jointly developed by Nippon
Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK Line) and IHI Power Systems Co.,
Ltd.. Ammonia is expected to be used as ship fuel for decarbonization
since it does not emit CO2 when combusted"

The Advocate: "Premier sells Japan on NSW green hydrogen.. With the
war in Ukraine driving up oil and gas prices, alternative sources of
clean energy, particularly green hydrogen, underscore NSW Premier
Dominic Perrottet's trade mission to Japan...

He hoped his government would have a whopping $270 billion invested
into the.. industry as the world pushes for decarbonisation..

With a blue Toyota hydrogen-powered vehicle parked behind him, the
premier said NSW has the scale and infrastructure to supply Japan and
other markets with 110,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030"

Aha this is the famous methane pyrolysis process.. Nice.

"C-Zero's technology, which was initially developed at the University
of California Santa Barbara, uses high temperatures to split methane -
the primary molecule in natural gas and renewable natural gas- into
hydrogen and solid carbon in a process known as methane pyrolysis."

Nordstream 2 has same capacity as Nordstream 1. It is blocked though,
first by US (due to its persistent strategy around sowing discord in
Eurasia), now it won't get turned on due to the war in Ukraine. 1 and
2 combined gives 130 GW. 

---

As a comparison.. Norstream 1 has a full daily gas capacity of around
150 million cubic meters. Natural gas has 10.55 kWh per cubic
meters, 10.55 * 150 * 1000000 / (24*1e6) equals 65 Gigawatts.

Need cheaper, more easily accessible materials.. What's up with those
perovskites?

An area at 56 km2, a square whose side is over 7 kilometers..

Great - let's have more of such plants.

It's a massive area though, trying to think of the materials required
to make that happen..

"The Bhadla Solar Park, which is the largest solar power plant in the
world, is based in Bhadla village, in India's Rajasthan's Jodhpur

A theory: Crises kill the elderly, the weak. The young remain, and
their attention is unleashed elsewhere, creating a more agressive
society. True or false? Thinking of Germany before WWII, Russia after
90s..

---

Russians still talk about the 90s crisis, why not? It must have been a
humiliating period for them. The US Great Depression was over 70 years
ago, still remembered today right? Well the Russian crisis was worse,
and not that long ago - relatively speaking.

---

The vid says Russian economic contraction and its effects were worse than
US's Great Depression.

---

Now CH has a debt problem; but hey, gotta have a crisis or two right?

Pandemic-proofing is a good measure for any system's improvement.
Education can be pandemic-proofed by relying on pre-recorded lecture
videos, less on teachers. Econ, by always paying digital UBI just
enough to keep ppl afloat. Lack of healthcare wld be acutely felt
during pandemic, enter single-payer. Etc.

The right-wing ITN party that is ahead in polls for next election,
Brotherhood of Italy is headed up by a woman oddly enough (and she
looks Anglo). Party wasn't overtly anti-Russia but after the war
changed their tune somewhat.. Their right overall is not RU
antogonistic.

---

The entire Italian government did not collapse just due to a bleeping
garbage incinerator I can guarantee that.

Obviously RU got benefits out of the deal too

Russian food and fertilisers to reach world markets as well' after
Moscow struggled with exports as a result of Western sanctions"
