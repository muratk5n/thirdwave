H2 View "Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation [in US] to provide natural
gas for the Great Plains Hydrogen Hub in the US.. Based in North
Dakota, US, Bakken Energy and Mitsubishi Power Americas have joined
forces on a $2bn hub which will focus on blue hydrogen production
which is derived from natural gas with the carbon emissions being
capture and sequestered.. The duo said they hope to connect the
facility by pipeline to other hydrogen hubs currently being developed
throughout North America"

300000 x 1000 x33.6 / (365x24x1e6) gives 1.15 Gigawatts. Lot of energy,
equivalent to one nuclear plant.

"Suez Canal green hydrogen production... With news that Egypt will
gain a new 300,000 tonnes waste-to-hydrogen production plant, it is
clear hydrogen will become a major aspect of the nationâ€™s renewable

Good progress. But be aware, fusion energy did not 'arrive' yet

BBC: "The UK-based JET laboratory has smashed its own world record for
the amount of energy it can extract by squeezing together two forms of
hydrogen...  Fusion reactions in the lab famously consume more energy
to initiate than they can output... But there is solid evidence that
this deficit can be overcome.. It's hoped the French lab will get to
breakeven."

IRN, Number Two. RU, Number One.

Few things jump out from the graph; coal consumption went down, natgas
took its place (just as polluting, if not more). Natgas is now on par
with oil but I'd say NG is now the king.

The oscillations for natgas indicates to me its consumption is much
more sensitive / responsive to demand, is depended on more, looks
seasonal so NG is probably the primary method for heating. NG is the
king to unseat. Or utilize, with blue H2, it's fine.

Nuclear use has been flat; if nuke plants were doubled it still
would not reach natgas levels.

Renewables are at an abysmal level.

Japanese real-estate bubble (1986-1990)? Look at the central bank
rates during that same period, they were at their lowest level they
had been since WWII. Ergo, bubble. Bubble burst but a stagnation
remained.. Abenomics gave more money to the rich, salaries did not
budge. No inflation. Low rates.

That could be ok depending on the social norms.. Excessive wealth

"But then anyone can see who owns what"

---

NFT is simply a record of ownership, it's intangible; but there is a
lot of intangible even in the most tangible asset there is -
[property](2008/03/revolutionary-wealth-toffler.md#intangible).

Without the record of who owns what real-estate would have no meaning.
In some distant future such record-keeping could completely move to
peer-to-peer based service. If gov, or a future form of gov
decides to enforce that instead of the ones it keeps itself, then
peer-to-peer digital assets would become the final arbiter of
ownership.

Globalization (now re-globalization) happened [before](2008/03/revolutionary-wealth-toffler.md#globalization)

Diversity of products a country can produce raises its econ, not how much it is globalized.

says otherwise.
