Analyst speculates China using B&R loans to turn yuan into a dollar
alternative; the loans were given in dollars, but now China could say
"you can pay us back in yuan, at a discount if you chose to do so".

Debtors could prefer that, creating additional demand for yuan raising
its value.. Actually B&R could be useful for this purpose alone. They
got rid of the dollars they don't want, and created yuan demand in
return.

The Chile fail was surprising because I'd read the Prez is the master

elements in it? At least something not hostile to left legislation
later on, ensuring basic rights now, removing the fascist shit pronto?

Talks about co-firing coal with ammonia / H2, and green
H2. Grand. Adani clearly sees where things are going..

---

Adani Group: "To further reduce the emission-intensity, Adani Power
Limited — the Group’s thermal power business — plans to blend biomass
with coal and is investigating pilots for co-firing of hydrogen and
green ammonia, as well as pilots for carbon capture and utilization.

Green hydrogen holds a strong promise for India’s future energy
self-reliance. It is not too difficult to imagine a scenario where
green hydrogen at a price of less than $1/kg — coupled with the
projected reduction in the cost of combined cycle hydrogen turbines
and fuel cells — will not only allow the country to make a transition
from fossil fuels, but will also free India from the debilitating
financial burden of energy imports.

This opportunity was signalled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he
announced the National Hydrogen Mission in August 2021 on India’s
Independence Day. This ambitious plan builds upon India’s target of
450 GW of renewables by 2030. It sends a strong signal for demand for
green hydrogen via mandates in sectors such as fertilizers and
refining, provides for viability gap funding and supply-side
incentives, such as waivers on import duty for electrolysers, as well
as manufacturing incentives to assemble and localize electrolyser
manufacturing. Addressing the UN General Assembly, Prime Minister Modi
also stated his ambition for India to become one of the largest green
hydrogen hubs in the world"

"Oxford quantum physicist Nikita Gourianov tore into the quantum
computing industry this week, comparing the 'fanfare' around the tech
to a financial bubble.. Despite billions of dollars being poured into
quantum computing, Gourianov argues, the industry has yet to develop a
single product that's actually capable of solving practical
problems... Contemporary quantum computers are also 'so error-prone
that any information one tries to process with them will almost
instantly degenerate into noise,' he [said]...

Despite the industry's less-than-stellar results, investors are still
funneling untold sums into quantum computing ventures. 'In essence,
the quantum computing industry has yet to demonstrate any practical
utility, despite the fanfare,' Gourianov wrote. 'Why is then so much
money flowing in? Well, it is mainly due to the fanfare.' The money,
he argues, is coming from investors who typically don't have 'any
understanding of quantum physics,' while 'taking senior positions in
companies and focusing solely on generating fanfare.'

In short, Gourianov believes it's only a matter of time until the
'bubble will pop' and the 'funding will dry up' — at which point, it's
already too late"

Truss was the better campaigner.. That became clear at those
one-on-one interviews. There is journo, candidate, and live audience
but the format was geared towards the questioner. Sunak had a tendency
to forgo the journo, and say something to rile up the audience, as if
in an effort to drown out question.. Then you sorta break the format,
the questioner is annoyed, that reflects badly on you. Maybe not for
people in the audience but others watching through broadcast would
pick this up.. Gave the impression of a lack of media management
skills. Truss handled one-on-ones better, spoke direcly to
questioner. Also overall messaging was consistent.
