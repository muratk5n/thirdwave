Nordic Business: "Renewable-Powered Trains Are On Track In The
Nordics.. 'Hydrogen trains can be used on lines where it isn’t
feasible to establish catenary lines and where there’s a need for
heavier and longer transport than what battery-powered trains can
manage. Hydrogen can be refuelled in less than 20 minutes and cover up
to 18 hours of driving. and often the cost of setting up a refuelling
station will be lower than setting up an electric charging station,
for instance if this requires reinforcement of the power grid,' says
Kristina Fløche Juelsgaard, head of business development at Ballard
Europe.

Ballard Europe makes fuel cells for buses, ships and trains, among
other things. The company is part of Canada’s Ballard Power Systems
which has so far supplied fuel cells for a passenger train in the UK
and a locomotive in Canada. Ballard Europa is also involved in two
projects in Norway, one of which aims to develop a hydrogen and fuel
cell solution for a locomotive to be used for transporting ore"

H2 View: "Construction of Namibia’s $10bn hydrogen project set to start
in 2025. The ambitious time-scale plans will see the commissioning of
the first phase of the project by the end of 2026, with an estimated
300,000 tonnes of green hydrogen production per year once at full
capacity"

---

“Longer-term, a hydrogen pipeline network offers the most
cost-efficient means of distribution. For example, pipelines can
transmit 10 times the energy at one-eighth the costs associated with
electricity transmission lines and have capex costs similar to those
for natural gas. The industry can partially reuse existing gas
infrastructure, but even newly constructed pipelines would not be cost
prohibitive"

S&P Global: "Australia is on course to hit a notable century – but not
on the cricket field. Around 98 hydrogen projects have been chalked up
in recent months, a substantial number aimed at a future export
market. And in February one of them, Victoria's Hydrogen Energy Supply
Chain (HESC), created a minor sensation with the first trial cargo of
liquid hydrogen to Japan... Australia is anxious to get a foothold in
the nascent hydrogen market to counter its established,
climate-compromised position as a major exporter of coal, LNG and
crude oil"

I'd ban crypto mining period (if possible), carbon or green; it's
completely unnecessary to create a digital cash. Plus it's not like
green energy is growing on trees either.

"The New York Senate has passed a bill that bans crypto mining
operations that use carbon-based fuel to power their facilities"

How did *free* help tech companies? It gave rise to huge server farms
and the "cloud business" which would not be possible wout free OS.
Imagine paying OS license fees for every one of those nodes in a
server farm... That would cost an arm and a leg. Now content creators
create their "livestreams" wout giving a second thought on how many
computing resources that entails. All that needs resources, which used
cost *more* before open-source software. The revolution, such as it
is, did not take place through commercial companies, it happened
through free software, through people contributing their time to a
project they thought was worth their time.

Prof Avi Loeb makes a good case; Oumuamua could be an artificial
man-made (or little-green-men-made) object. He is not that excited
about UFO sightings, bashes ppl wasting time on string theory
(gymnastics in Anti-de Sitter space), and the multiverse. He seems to
have the right kind of bullshit filter.
