H2 Fuel News: "Quantron has a hydrogen fuel cell truck with a massive
range of 930 miles...  The company unveiled several long-range
H2-powered vehicles at the IAA Transportation show.

Quantron has been working with Ballard Power Systems¬†as a part of a
strategic partnership. Through it, the company has been able to
develop a hydrogen fuel cell truck that will be able to travel
considerable distances before needing to refuel.

This is a considerable achievement as it helps to further support the
viability of H2 as a fuel for the long-haul trucking industry,
particularly compared to the range available from battery electric
vehicles, which must also carry heavy batteries to stay powered and
that require notably longer recharging times...

The Quantron QHM FCEV (fuel cell electric vehicle) is equipped with an
FCmove-XD 120 kW fuel cell that is among Ballard‚Äôs latest
developments"
