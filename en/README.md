Not about this bee thing per se, but the world should switch to
sealed-off controlled vertical-farming style environments, plus
lab-farm meat and related products.. It is baffling humankind is
relying on so many natural processes to survive.. Let's take nature
out of the natural, nam sayin'?

no more plants, no more animals, no more man."

Already looking ahead to the 'next challenge'? Done with Russia?
Speculation: Everyone is guessing where the war is headed..  RU will
finalize the conflict in its own terms, and be done attacking shit
left and right for a while. NATO will need something to do in the
meantime.

"The key cornerstone of U.S. and NATO methodology is maneuver
warfare. Maneuver warfare depends on communication and synchronization
of assets. The U.S. has communication infrastructure down to the four
man Infantry Fire Team level and the ability to battle track those
formations with almost real-time speed. When everything functions as
designed, these smaller formations can achieve much larger effects
than their Russian equivalent..

Because of maneuver warfare’s reliance on communication, Russia has
invested heavily in Electronic Warfare systems which are capable of
shutting down communications and signals across a broad spectrum"

Russians were approaching.But he couldn’t. For 15 soldiers spread
across a defensive line stretching roughly 200 yards, he had only two
radios.. By the time the sergeant.. managed to run to his men’s
position, three of them had been killed"
