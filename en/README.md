H2 Fuel News: "California pours $2 billion into renewable hydrogen and
offshore wind California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that
there is 'no one more committed' to supportingÂ clean energy
production use and storage as massive investments are aimed at
renewable hydrogen and offshore wind energy"

F24: "[In Peru] beaches [are] tarred by 6,000 barrels of oil that
spilled from a tanker ship unloading at a refinery last Saturday. That
accident followed the stunningly powerful eruption of an undersea
volcano near the nation of Tonga, unleashing tsunami waves around the
Pacific"

Batteries dont work if it's too cold. PV panels dont work if it's too
hot.  Electricity grid for power transmission is 1/10th efficient,
with 8 times the cost compared to gas. However we look at it, the
electricity based approach is inferior.

"Down here in Southern California, the worst of the heat wave is
behind us [22/6/2017]... With all that sun, you'd think all of those
solar panels out there would be lapping it up. But it turns out, they
don't work that well when it gets really hot"

Nathan Lewis from Caltech is working on artificial photosynthesis, similar to
prev solution, also going to H2 direct.

The research below is about H2 generation using basic chemistry - mere
sunlight, water and a catalyst. No electricity needed. More research
in this direction would be good. Shared [another post](https://helioscsp.com/synlight-concentrated-solar-power-to-produce-h2/)
in the same vicinity before.

"Due to the inexhaustible magnitude and usability of solar energy, the
solar-driven two-step water-splitting thermochemical cycle is
generally considered a solution for hydrogen production from
water.. Recently, CeO2 (cerium oxide) had received considerable
attention as a potential reactive metal oxide"

Sean Shamrock.. working the backchannel. But didn't work

"In the aftermath of the deadly attack on the US Capitol last year,
the rightwing Fox News host Sean Hannity pleaded with a top aide to
Donald Trump that there should be 'no more stolen election talk' and
'no more crazy people' should be admitted to the presidentâ€™s orbit"

Euler went blind in 1771 at age 64. He published roughly 1 paper per
week in 1775.

After he had died in 1783, Euler published 228 papers. 

~1/3 of all published research on mathematics, mathematical physics &
engineering mechanics in the latter part of the 18th century is his"

There is still a narrative of helplessness around Russians.. After

Computation split into two cultures since its inception; one is
scientific computation (discretizing formulas), the other business
coding, w databases, "UI". The two cultures gathered around their own
computer languages, Fortran for sci, Cobol for biz. These are two
different ways of thinking about computation.. Silicon Valley is full
of the latter type - the business brogrammers. They pretty much have
zero understanding of science and how it is conducted. So it behooves
all tech watchers to pay attention to that difference as the typical
tech CEO is sci ignorant, bereft of any understanding on what makes it
tick.

---

Can partly be blamed on the mindshare influenced by Silicon Valley
'coders' who are really digital bean counters.. They believe they can
fix all by 'knocking out some code', or now a "neural net".

This weirdness is still making rounds in the media \#science

That makes sense gold has no intrinsic value, has no coupons, brings
no interest. In a potentially rising interest rate environment people
will sell it. Recently price went down, it will go lower as rates
rise.

RT/Russia is working the anti-dollar angle bcz they dont like the
dollar hegemony. There isn't enough gold to form the backbone of an
intl system. Let's not goad people into stupid investments.

---

RT anchor talks about gold being a hedge against rising
inflation. There is a reverse relation between the 10-year treasury
(rates) and gold price. Gold has gone lower from its 2020 highs, not
higher.
