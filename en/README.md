TeX craps out. Where were my symlinks at?  Bring it on!

No green tech comes close to renewable fuels' versatility. Between
green ammonia and green H2, they can handle all cases. Ammonia can
even handle refigration. H2 can power rockets (see the latest Blue
Origin launch). H2 can even act as a battery, see
[Lavo](https://lavo.com.au/).

Dried beans are extremely energy inefficient. Rehydrating, cooking
them takes too much energy, and when hydrated they become too heavy
(with all that water).

"Certain products require longer cooking periods thus energy
consumption is higher. For example, cooking beans takes around eight
times longer and can require more than 200 MJ per kg food"

New PM's opponent was pro-renewables, we'll see how PM turns out.
Oppo was more popular but he didn't get the nod. Japan cld benefit
from another strong party. They need ideological division.

Lowflation is not a good place to be.. Investment starts going after
bizarre companies, debtors get in trouble, ppl dont have incentive to
spend.

Ew but young people, old people, etc.. How many ppl does it take to
invent a bleeping Walkman? You can get stuff done, with the same amt
of ppl and the right structure.

Abenomics tried and tried and failed to increase inflation. It should
not be too surprising, Japan's labor pool was decreasing. Inflation
requires workers who are earning salary and spending it. One choice
cld be giving existing ppl more money to spend - direct cash. Abe did
bunch of supply-side band-aid ("cutting red tape"), and failed.
