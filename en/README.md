could watch it and laugh at FG, conservatives would be like 'that guy

positive.. Now u always have to bang on the drum, for something..
Massive propaganda.

Lockdown parties.. bad bad. Britain's culture code for itself is
CLASS. By ignoring the rules BJ said "I'm above you" (reachers emo
brain, very powerful). It's particularly damaging for BJ bcz his whole
shtick was being "against the elites". "Elites" wanted Bremain,
"people" needed Brexit. Cameron looked like an "elite", BJ was the
pudgy, everyman looking guy (both grads of Eton but ssshhh), so when
BJ did the elite thing, it became 10 times more damaging.

---

The new off kilter ideology backdrop cld also be partly why UK BJ was
too gung-ho on Russia (even before the war); conservatives are
generally hawkish, well, this was still one 'conservative' thing he
could still do..

---

Politics in some Western countries are off-kilter.. During the UK
trucker shortages I actually heard PM BJ say "well if there are
shortages, maybe businesses should pay better wages". A Tory
PM. Asking higher wages. It's like someone said the moon is made of
cheese, or I walked to school and back, up the hill both ways..
It's good to hear but from a supposedly con party?

A cow gives 240 kg of meat.. Not 'eating a cow' every month, let's relax.

---

For 80g prot intake daily, for 10 days, u'd need roughly 3 kg of
meat. Dam.

---

It's not uncommon to get 70-80% mass reduction on meat after
dehydration. Makes sense we know we are 70% water. That hints at max
protein content; cant possibly get more than 30% protein from meat
(lit says 26%), bcz the rest is water.

---

So many simple dishes out there. Toss raw spinach, diced onions, some
olive oil together, cook 5 mins medium heat. Wait until cold, mix in
plain yogurt. [Boom](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FQm9U8BWUAcMm_F?format=jpg&name=small).

Similar to Persian borani, Greeks have a version too. Rich in lutein,
iron and with yogurt u get lots of calcium, protein.

The persecution of the religious folk played a major role for
enshrining freedoms into law in US, not "the affluents" feeling
slighted by bakers when denied a cake.

---

Things go off the rails sadly when they ask children to "choose" a
gender identity (be individual, early). But these are kids at an age
when they are busy playing make-belief games. One thinks he is a
robot, the other an elf.. One says he is a garbage truck. How do you
handle that one? Now your kid is a garbage truck. Do you treat him as
such?

---

US libs are so fervent believers of individuality that they will
create previously non-existing categories to give ppl "more
opportunities" to exercise that individuality. Notice the ever
increasing new letters to that already huge moniker, L, G, B, T, Q, it
goes on, I, A, 2S,.. They added a + on there too just to signal there
could be more. Pick any letter, pick two or three, see how that makes
you unique.
