H2 Central: "[T]he Wyoming Energy Authority has released a roadmap
that outlines the path to building a hydrogen economy in the state...
'Hydrogen‚Äôs role as a decarbonized energy carrier with unprecedented
transportation and consumption utility makes this a truly
transformational opportunity for the entire state.'

Hydrogen can be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks ‚Äì including
coal, natural gas, wind and even nuclear power ‚Äì bringing the
potential to help sustain the wide variety of Wyoming‚Äôs abundant
natural reserves. In addition, hydrogen‚Äôs flexible structure can be
converted and transported in various ways, allowing Wyoming to utilize
its existing infrastructure, including an extensive natural gas
transmission system.

Hydrogen can also be added to existing raw low-value energy sources to
significantly increase the resiliency of Wyoming‚Äôs value chain and
provide processing opportunities within the state"

H2 Central: "While scaling up the production of electrolyser systems is paramount,
the importance of how green hydrogen will be transported cannot be
overstated...

For distances below 1,500km, transporting hydrogen as a gas via
pipeline is ‚Äúgenerally the cheapest delivery option‚Äù; above 1,500km,
shipping hydrogen as ammonia or an LOHC may be more cost-effective, it
said, citing data from the International Energy Agency‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Future
of hydrogen ‚Äì Seizing today‚Äôs opportunities‚Äô report"

The sky cld get even more pink if you smoked it

Hindustan Times: "Sky turns pink in Australia town, locals think of
aliens. What actually happened.. Locals, fascinated by the phenomenon,
considered outworldly possibilities. But they were fairly disappointed
when it was found to be emerging from a cannabis plant"

US needs gun control for the police, and speficially for the
police. That would change their conduct, interactions with the people
right? Right now they are probably confronting every situation while
thinking about using their gun to handle it.

"Denver police opened fire into a crowd, injuring 6 bystanders, while
going after a suspect who never fired a gun"

Baba Vanga predictions.. "a psycic seer" who died 1996.. Two of the
2022 predictions came true apparently, floods and drought. Now let's
assume this psycic truly had some skill, some wires crossed in the
"simulation" and information is leaking and that is what's being
reported...

But the predictions are still open to interpretation. Like one that
said "the Russian city of Kursk would be covered with water and the
whole world will weep over it".  Nothing happened to the city, but the
the Kursk *submarine* sank and 118 military personnel died. So a name
and a general nationality was right, the sinking, the scale is
completely off. How do we treat other predictions now? One mentions
alien invasion, does that simply mean alien signals being confirmed,
or outright invasion? We don't know.

Hang on. Are we seriously considering precipitating an unnecessary
crisis on Taiwan, at the same time as we‚Äôre engaged in a major proxy
war in Europe, and facing down a potential nuclear crisis with Iran? ü§î"

Davis: "Bucking Basic (Western) Beliefs: Ukraine is in far worse shape
than portrayed ‚Äì¬†Ukrainian officials claim their forces are ready to
launch a ‚Äúmillion-man offensive‚Äù against Russian forces next month,
while retired U.S. generals talk confidently about the war ending on
Ukraine‚Äôs terms by the end of this year. But an unemotional and
realistic assessment of the war‚Äôs most likely trajectory paints a
different picture.

Ukraine War Scenario Two: Russian Capture of Kharkiv & Odessa.. 

If Kharkiv falls, Ukraine will have even fewer troops left with which
to defend Odessa. If Russia were to mobilize enough men, it is
conceivable that they could invest Odessa even before Kharkiv was
completely captured. But whether simultaneously or sequentially, if
Russia moved on Odessa they would almost certainly employ the same
strategy they‚Äôve used countless times already in this war, surround
the city, cut off its defenders, and then crush the city with
saturating firepower.

If Russia were to successfully take both Kharkiv and Odessa (after
having taken the Donbas before), then Russia would essentially be in
control of all of Ukraine east of the Dnieper River. .. Once the
fighting gets to that point, however, Ukraine will have effectively
lost the war. The chances of it ever regaining any lost territories
would be virtually nil"
