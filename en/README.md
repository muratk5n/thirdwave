Euractiv: "Germany’s Scholz rallies G7 countries behind ‘climate club’
idea..

It will be built on three policies. Firstly, ambitious climate
“mitigation” policies to reduce emission intensities of participating
economies where members share best practices and work towards a common
understanding of the economic impacts of “mitigation” policies, such
as through explicit carbon pricing.

A second pillar will be the joint transformation of industry through
the industrial decarbonisation agenda, the hydrogen action pact and by
expanding markets for green industrial products, which often struggle
to compete on price with their more polluting fossil competitors.

The climate club’s third pillar will be partnerships and cooperation,
with the statement highlighting the “Just Energy Transition
Partnerships” (JETPs), which are schemes tailored to countries like
South Africa or India. Countries will receive financial support and
technology transfers depending on their level of climate ambition
through these JETPs"

The Apollo missions were not dumb tries; had clear goals (Lyndon
Johnson knew his shit).

Kennedy just made that speech, "we go to the Moon because I'm haahd"..
that's it. The idea was LBJ's. Clear goal backed with know-how.

Electrification goal: another dumb try. There isn't enough lithium in
the world. The electric grid is inefficient and will always be so; the
base science is screwed up. Can't "tinker", "take a chance" your way
out of this problem.

A lot about US is about "dumb tries". You win by trying a lot, and
hopefully 'striking gold'. That approach might be reaching the end of
its usefulness. The culture likely formed while exploring the "new
lands", all you needed was courage, a push, enough for you to start
the journey, the rest would be adventure and hopefully a lot of gains.

But tinkering with a dangerous virus gave us covid. Stupid courage can
push you to Mars, but will also kill you there. Crossing the Atlantic
to reach new lands was different type of experimentation.. There was
still land, air, the downside for failure actually wasn't too high.
