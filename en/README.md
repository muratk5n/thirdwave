Paper: "Cost of long-distance energy transmission by different
carriers.. This paper compares the relative cost of long-distance,
large-scale energy transmission by electricity, gaseous, and liquid..
carriers. The results indicate that the cost of electrical
transmission per delivered MWh can be up to eight times higher than
for hydrogen pipelines"

Great news - Russkie has long history on fundamental science, there
could be fine discoveries from there.

"Russian university is looking to develop hydrogen technologies.. The
Siberian Federal University’s School of Natural Gas and Petroleum has
opened a new ‘intersectoral’ research centre for innovative
technologies, the SIDERA Centre, with plans of introducing hydrogen
technologies into various industries"

"Saudi Arabian oil company Aramco and SABIC Agri-Nutrients (AN)
Company announced the firms have obtained the world’s first

production. Aramco said in a statement the German-based testing,

certifications to SABIC AN for 37,800 tonnes of blue ammonia and
Aramco’s wholly owned refinery for 8,075 tonnes of blue hydrogen"

Vacancy rate, the number of job openings per unemployed which showes
"labor market tighness" is through the roof. The great resignation
might have had an effect here. There be slowdown and a tight labor
market at the same time with these conditions. WSJ is right - every
crisis is different.

Alex Jones gets 1 thing wrong (and even that's debated to this day) in
25 years, apologizes dozens of times, and he has to pay $4M via court
order. MSM deliberately lies every day, yet no court orders to pay
anyone anything.

That is a good campaign jab

"John Fetterman Enlists New Jersey Legend Steven Van Zandt To Troll
Dr. Oz..  Fetterman on Tuesday posted a video of the New Jersey
legend, musician-actor Steven Van Zandt, telling Oz to ― and we’re
paraphrasing here ― get back to where he belongs. 'What are you doing
in Pennsylvania? Everybody knows you live in New Jersey..  come on
back to Jersey where you belong and we’ll have some fun, eh? We’ll go
to the beach. We’ll go surfing. You know?  C’mon.'"

Excellent.

Long-ass numbers. To pick something out of a list (song, video) take
mod (divide, use remainder) by number of items, that's your random
item picker.

Says 'find an output that is transient'; I guess the output of a Unix
process list is pretty transient - new programs get created,
destroyed, their uptime, ordering can change which changes the output,
which will give a near-random looking digest.

---

Unix book suggests take output of `ps gaux` generate a digest (single
number) from it.. Good idea

---

Random num generator not looking good.. I started noticing repeats on
my jukebox. New one is needed.

If international institutions had muscle and foresight coulda preempt
some of this - but now navies are patrol the area, there can be a nice
little war one day with gazillions of interests at risk.

---

According to 1923 Lausanne Treaty the islands near Asia Minor were
supposed to be demilitarized. This rule has not been followed by
Greece. 

---

Is anybody following this shit? If there was an MSM with half a brain
there would be 5 min programs outlining this whole thing. It ain't
that hard.

---

Now here's some more crazier stuff; TR/US rel soured. Russkie has
access to EastMed (through Syria) and soon perhaps most of northern
Black Sea EEZ. A confluence of interest occured, TR will increase RU
rel, provide transit to RU exports, and will buy more military
hardware from Russia, and in return recruit some RU help in the
EastMed.  TR/RU on one side, Greece, Egypt, Israel, (EU?) on the
other.

---

Planned EastMed pipeline, first found problematic (by US/EU now back
in play due to problems with Russian gas) goes right through
disputed areas

Greece and Egypt have a counter-agreement that contradicts Libya-TR,
it's a big "EEZ off".

---

That's why the so-called Blue Homeland EEZ was enacted unilaterally
since 2013, and is now being followed. The corridor with Libya was
agreed upon based on this EEZ.

[[-]](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZf38WYXkAIRz4W?format=png&name=small)

---

The problem between Greece and Asia Minor is Greece has too many
islands close to AM restricting its access - combined with Cyprus
(the whole of which is still considered Greek) the EEZs become massive.
That ain't fair for homie.

12 nautical miles off coast is territorial waters.

200 nautical miles is EEZ (exclusive econ zone, rights for explotation
of resources).

If EEZ of two countries overlap, a line is drawn in the middle
usually. Example Sri Lanka and India [here](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZf0YjmXoAYKHEh?format=png&name=small).
