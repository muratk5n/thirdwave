US, instead of triggering a "Shale Revolution" in 2005, could have
gone solar, expand its already substantial H2 pipeline capacity, help
commercialize the fuel-cell NASA invented in the 60s.

Instead of building those ghost cities China could have built thermo
solar plants and at this point be energy sufficient, and carbon
neutral.

"Despite the hopeful attitude during the 1950s and 1960s, it was soon
acknowledged that Artificial Intelligence was a much harder problem
than initially assumed. Today, AI capable of thinking like a human is
referred to as artificial general intelligence (AGI) and still firmly
the realm of science-fiction. Much of what we call ‘AI’ today is in
fact artificial narrow intelligence (ANI, or Narrow AI)"

Bloomberg: "It's become the conventional wisdom that the U.S. economy
is built on Americans' endless appetite to buy lots and lots of
stuff. Household consumption makes up about 67% of GDP. When the
economy falters, we're told spending is our patriotic duty. But
suddenly, Americans can’t spend like they used to. Store shelves are
emptying, and it can take months to find a car, refrigerator or
sofa. If this continues, we may need to learn to do without — and,
horrors, live more like the Europeans. That actually might not be a
bad thing, because the U.S. economy could be healthier if it were less
reliant on consumption"

Can subsidize both options first.. Like good money driving out bad,
good energy tech will drive out bad tech, eventually. Subsidising both
optiosn will make sure so people dont revolt as in France yellow
vests, and once they both options are on par -in terms of infra,
support (repair, maintainence, second-hand sales)-, then subsidies for
the latter can be cut off.

Need to work the incentives.. What do countries like? Cheap
energy. First world, develop thermosolar-H2 locally, then, or at the
same time, builds a few of those for developing countries,
transferring know-how..

I'm sure ppl COP6 made the best deal they could with that
gathering.. And there is room to do more.
