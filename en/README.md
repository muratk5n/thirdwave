What is the current RU natgas export (to EU) shortfall? 20%? Lower?

From UK we know blending 20% H2 into existing natural gas pipeline
works. If the tech were ready that would fix gas shortfall. Blending
wld automatically increase supply. For gaps <20% blend 20%, done. No
change in infra needed.

Of course additional H2 needs to be generated for blending, not
available yet -- the crisis came too early.

Not that China is a superpower or anything.. But it is at a level of
France, which is in G7.

Post WWII setup is weird.. Germany is not included in the UNSC. China
is not included in G7.

Would any authoritarian gov change the ending of M4? Why bother..? The
ending is for weak-ass Holywood shitlibs, they are just flying around
enjoying their airheaded 'inclusion'. Harmless.

The Matrix 4 ending was weak, scared and abysmal. *Fight Club* got it
right.. That was one courageous, fantastic movie, from start to
finish.

NYT: â€˜Fight Clubâ€™ Ending Is Restored in China After Censorship
Outcry.. Last month, viewers noticed that the ending of the 1999 film
had been replaced with a pro-government message. Now the ending is
back, and the message is gone.

Stronger unions provide better institutional muscle to the left 4
politics. Can't have bunch of random people running around jumping up
and down 'protesting', dancing on TikTok and hope there'll be a
change. Organization, leadership is needed.

Anti-trust isn't just for better capitalism. Need to adjust the power
dynamic between gov and biz. Reagan was a conservative, but he had to
be cognizant of the fact that in order to govern, can't get overrun by
monopoly power.


---

Would expect Dems to be more hawkish on anti-trust, but no..  After RR
not only did they let existing monopolies fester, they gave rise to
new ones. So called libertarians either watched the whole thing like a
gaping fish, or generated some junk culture war material for Reps to
use while weaseling their way in, to give their billionaire friends
cover.

---

Anti-trust could be a Republican thing.. cons are pro-business, if
especially pro **small** business, they can go there.. Ronald Reagan
broke up AT&T.
