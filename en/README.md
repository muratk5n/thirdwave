H2 View: "[Secretary General of Hydrogen Europe] Jorgo Chatzimarkakis
unveils proposal for hydrogen to be included in European gas reserve
plans at H2 View’s Virtual Hydrogen Summit Europe 2022"

---

H2 at $1.50/kg means 10.48 dollars/Gigajoules, in the range of the
table [here](2022/02/costs-lcoe.md) that beats natgas. NG is still
good, but Hysata's number is better. 

---

Good development

H2 View: "Breakthrough technology to enable hydrogen production of
below $1.50/kg in Australia.. Based in Australia, Hysata’s
capillary-fed electrolysis cell is capable of producing green hydrogen
from water at 98% cell energy efficiency..

The technology was invented by scientists at the University of
Wollongong and is now being commercialised by Hysata, with backing
from IP Group and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC)"

H2 View: "Bavaria’s first hydrogen train to hit tracks next year.. The
German state of Bavaria will soon boast its first-ever
hydrogen-powered train – and it will be presented to the public this
spring"

Only had 17 cloudy days btw Aug-Feb..? Some fine-ass DNI!

---

Cosin is in Qinghai. Yep.. Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan, Shaanxi. All have
a lot of potential. China can become energy independent, using
solar alone.

---

SolarPaces: "Cosin Solar.. seemed to burst on the global [CSP] scene
as a fully fledged Chinese CSP firm. Among China’s pilot projects, the
Supcon Delingha 50 MW tower CSP with 7 hours of storage in Qinghai
Province was among the few to succeed in China’s pilot program.

The project reached full load much faster than the first CSP projects
in the US.., and entering regular operation recorded by the government
by late 2019. I spoke with Cosin Solar Chairman Jin Jianxiang..

JJ: 'Many people who don’t know our background think we succeeded in
the first shot. In fact, we have been researching CSP technology for
over 12 years from lab tests to demonstration pilots..

From 2013 to 2015, through 3 years of experimental research, we
successfully solved the problems of mirror field control, heat
absorber tube burst, molten salt valve leak, electrical heat tracing
failure etc...

For the last 187 days, from 26th August 2021 to 28th February 2022, we
had 17 cloudy days and actually operated for 170 days. We’ve averaged
over 100% of expected generation for 103 of those days, and the
remaining 67 days were a little under 100%. During this period since
August last year, aggregate DNI was 1197 kWh/m², for a theoretical
production of 91 GWh. Yet our actual production was 92 GWh, and our
average power generation achievement rate was 101%"

H2 View: "[Michelin is] betting big on [H2, as] the energy carrier, as
[VP] Sabet made clear in his presentation. Through a vast array of
projects and collaborations, the company is expanding its footprint in
the hydrogen mobility space. Detailing one of many projects the
Michelin is currently working on, Sabet said, 'We are working on a
hydrogen corridor project. It was the first of its kind back in 2017
and it has a vision to create a hydrogen [station] corridor of 20
sites to refuel 1,200 vehicles.'

Hympulsion, a joint venture between Michelin and Engie, is making the
corridor come to life, having invested ?8m in deploying refuelling
stations and catalysts for distributing and producing decarbonised
hydrogen"

WION: "India's first Hydrogen-powered car to be unveiled.. India's
Minister for Road Transport and Highways Mr Nitin Gadkari made a big
announcement at WION Climate Summit on March 15"

The change described below would mean adding a few Ukraine-level food
shortage issues on top of ones we already have.

NBC News: "The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change examined how agriculture will be affected by global warming, as
well as how food production and other changes in land use are expected
to contribute to climate change in the future. The panel concluded
that if average global temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius over the
pre-industrial average — something that previous reports by the panel
have suggested could happen by the end of the century — the risk of
food supply instabilities 'are projected to be very high,' according
to the report, which was written by more than 100 scientists from
around the world.

One of the key ways food production could be affected is by extreme
weather events. Studies have shown that climate change is increasing
both the frequency and severity of extreme weather, causing more
intense downpours during storms or lengthening extreme heat waves, for
example, which can disrupt crops or alter growing seasons.. 'In the
past, bad weather in one area has been compensated by perhaps better
weather in another, but some of our research has shown that as we move
toward 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the probability of major cereal
producers facing synchronous shocks in the same season goes way up,'
said Rosamond Naylor, director of the Center on Food Security and the
Environment at Stanford University"

Not cool.. not cool at all

"@LeeCamp

My TV show Redacted Tonight has been deleted from @YouTube . So, even
if you hate everything I ever said, are we all cool with this? Big
tech deletes anything that goes against the corporate state. Does that
sound fine? Or has America become the monster it claims to fight
against?"

Bloomberg: "Petro-Yuan Still Far-Fetched Even Amid Saudi Mulling Oil Deals"

---

The dollar system created an extremely lopsided world. If you think
about it, after RU invasion due to sanctions there was now the danger
for countries who want Russian gas would not be able to pay for the
Russian gas. Under the current system that payment can surely get cut,
but then the system itself comes into question.. "Who the muck are
they to dictate how two neighbors trade from the other side of the
world?"  will be the thought. Right? Wasn't "the inability to govern
from afar" the reason for US's own independence from Britain?

:)

"@theRealKiyosaki

End of US [dollar]?  Saudi Arabia [is considering] to sell China oil
and trade in Chinese Yuan, not US $. US hegemony ending. US less of a
world power. Thank you Brandon. Just what happens next is in
question. I will do my best to keep you posted before things
happen. Take care. Not good"
