Belgium has easy shipping access. Tasmania has sunshine, other natural
resources (hydro), generate H2 and ship.

H2 View: "The Tasmanian Government [an island state of Australia] has
today inked its first state-to-state agreement on green hydrogen with
the region of Flanders, in Northern Belgium."

The Atlantic: "Vaccination rates are high on mainland China, about 88
percent, but mRNA vaccines are not available. The German firm BioNTech
has been waiting months for approval to enter the Chinese
market.. China has not developed its own mRNA jab [.. uses]
Chinese-developed Sinopharm and Sinovac shots. These 'inactivated
virus' vaccines have proved to be less effective at stopping COVID
deaths"

The Atlantic: "Hong Kong.. pursues a zero-COVID strategy. Flight bans
have caused air traffic to plummet. On January 31, just 100 passengers
arrived at Hong Kong International Airport, previously one of the
worldâ€™s busiest travel hub..

Authorities culled thousands of hamsters after an infection was traced
to a local pet shop. Carrie Lam, the cityâ€™s chief executive, lashed
out at a hamster owner who didnâ€™t turn over his pet, saying it had
caused an outbreak. The maligned rodent, however, tested negative for
the virus, clearing its name"

TBD: "At moments of national division and conflict, the power of the
Supreme Court is often amplified.. They can serve as a bulwark against
extremism, as the Court did during the post-World War II era when it
slapped back efforts by whites in the former Confederacy to preserve
Jim Crow. Or they can promote division and conflict, as the Court did
by issuing the Dred Scott decision in 1857, which incorporated the
most radical of Southern slaveholdersâ€™ positions into the
Constitution, including by denying Black Americans U.S. citizenship"

TDB: "When writer and filmmaker Rupert Russell sat down to write his
book *Price Wars*, which covers how price volatility is the root of
global chaos, he didn't expect Alan Greenspan, the longtime former
Federal Reserve chairman, to be a 'villain' in the story. But in this
bonus episode of The New Abnormal, Russell explains how a move by
Greenspan to deregulate the commodity markets in 1998 has caused
decades of market trouble"

Liberterianism is poisened in US.. A coopted version is used to
provide cover for billionaires while they push for
pro-liberty-sounding ideas, at the same time they generate culture war
material to make themselves useful among the equally corrupt, retarded
right-wing Republicans. All those merry band of cocksuckers around
Peter Thiel do nothing but tout this shit.. The German version of
liberterians fights an abortion rule created by *actual Nazis*, US
faux-liberterians will stand silent to weasel their way in to Rep
circles then push for [anti-green agenda](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-15/peter-thiel-gamed-silicon-valley-tech-trump-taxes-and-politics).
These ppl are wretched cocksuckers.

NYT: "Facing Tough Election, Orban Turns to Putin for Support. The
Hungarian leader made his name by defying Moscow. But he has
increasingly turned toward Russia in an effort to secure the natural
gas he needs to keep energy prices low and voters happy"

This is some kind of crazy science!

Its good to try things.. Mow ask it to summarize the text it generates
and let me know. I'm waiting by the phone.

Dear English-speaking friends, As part of my PhD, I'm researching
human-AI creative interaction. I created a little tool [you enter two

Jets have incredibly high energy behind them, they can't be pushed
from bunch of random stuff swirling around a black hole. Cant have a
bullet firing out of a water swirl while it's going down the
drain.. Physically impossible.

How do jets escape black holes from which supposedly nothing can
escape, including light?

It seems to me w omicron countries need to forgo testing, push for
more vax where possible; more testing will just overwhelm the system.

Watched some NBC 2.. What a dumpster fire.. It's all about crime,
money, some warm-and-fuzzy feel-good section via a pet, then back to
crime, consumerism and money. All in a chipper tone. Hell on
TV... Catch us on streaming! I don't think so bitch!

It's about picking the right pieces, which means the right-sized
pieces. Tiny particles are too numerous, plus never clearly defined /
definable.  They are not the right components to put together for
*greater sum*. But looking at macro measurable attributes, placing
those together in nonlinear ways (or transform them in ways so they
can be added linearly) is the right granularity and an approach that
work for us (humans).

"You said science is not about tiny particles, instead mathematical
relations, but in greater sum approach you say nonlinear combos can
have large effects"
