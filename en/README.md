H2 View: "Alfa Laval has signed an agreement to deliver compact heat
exchangers to the world’s largest green hydrogen plant, which is to be
built in the upcoming city of Neom in Saudia Arabia.

Neom’s location and infrastructure will allow the generation of 4GW of
renewable power from solar and wind where the green hydrogen
production facility will use about half of it.

It will be the largest green hydrogen plant and the first installation
of gigawatt size, producing 650 tonnes of hydrogen per day. This in
turn will be used to produce 1.2 million tonnes of green ammonia
annually"

Cores are still preferable to GPUs for massively paralel archs
(sometimes both can be used in conjunction). CPUs can run anything,
with proper algo most 'number crunching' can be paralelized through
them. GPU's speciality is simple, micro operations.

Key piece of knowledge for stats, yet nowhere to be found - except
this one lone paper on arXiv.. Stuff keeps slipping through the
cracks.

Paper: "An exact method of calculating the variance of a [combined]
data set is presented. Its major advantages over the many other
methods are that it is simple, is easily derived and remembered, and
requires no assumptions... The proof is so simple that it has
certainly been done many times before, but it is absent in the
textbooks"

Sounds like a useful program..

"FDR Civilian Conservation Corps Roosevelt established the Civilian
Conservation Corps in 1933. The CCC or C's as it was sometimes known,
allowed single men between the ages of 18 and 25 to enlist in work
programs to improve America's public lands, forests, and parks"
