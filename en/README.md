petroleum refining, renewable energy and clean hydrogen"

Electricity is suitable as the *last* step in the energy chain, not
the first. It can be generated close to its consumers, through
fuel-cells.. But since its storage and transmisson is too inefficient,
its usage as the centerpiece of an energy system is problematic.

It's a matter of existing infrastructure, know-how. But go ahead,
electrolyze, or just as good, let's develop [thermochemical water splitting](2022/02/h2-thermo-chemical.html).
Especially [molten salt reactors](2022/02/h2-thermo-chemical.html#thorium)
have promise in this area (uses thorium, the waste product is better manageable).

That could produce 3.5 GW equivalent of H2.. A big solar plant

Ethanol production is very little but highest in US compared to
some other countries.

- CAPER achieves process intensified hydrogen production from ethanol.

- High-pressure H2 is electrochemically produced at low temperatures and voltages.

- CO2 is captured within the caustic electrolyte for a carbon-neutral process.

- 100% Faraday efficiency and pure H2 in the gas phase is achieved.

Ethanol is produced in US mostly from corn AFAIK

"CAPER .. [process] converts aqueous-phase ethanol into high-purity,
high-pressure hydrogen. This technique is sustainable because the
caustic electrolyte solution captures and processes any greenhouse gas
emissions"

Some articles on crude oil gasification -
[paper](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10916466.2016.1255643),
[paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328087957_Modeling_crude_oil_gasification),
[paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320261146_Kinetic_modeling_of_crude_oil_gasification_for_hydrogen_production_with_in_situ_CO_2_capture).
This method is less widely used though compared to coal and natgas. Still,
for countries who want to pursue it, there it is.

"@DanPriceSeattle

So a $700 billion bailout for the banks, an 80 billion bailout for the
auto industry, a 50 billion bailout for the airlines and a 3 trillion
dollar Fed bailout for the stock market are all "capitalism" but
unemployment checks are 'socialism?'"

Some could argue the existing system turned the world into a
basketcase, creating pollution, environment disasters, and encouraging
material extraction beyond the carrying capacity of Earth, while still
not being able to beat global poverty. 

"But the existing system brought us much dynamism"

Surely wage decrease sounds bad.. this is how the mechanism works
though - sadly.  That's the reason I advocate new money entering the
economy through people rather than businesses.

---

Certain MSM narrative is "if interest rates fall, spending increases,
because people borrow to spend". That is not the primary driver of
price levels. The major transmission mechanism (though crude) is
through businesses borrowing and expanding less, wages and spending
decrease, causing a decrease in prices.

Al Monitor: "Pro-Sadr protesters storm [the Iraqi] parliament.. Sadr's
bloc won 73 seats in.. 2021 election, making it the largest faction in
the 329-seat parliament. But since the vote, talks to form a new
government have stalled. The oil-rich country remains mired in a
political and a socioeconomic crisis, despite elevated global oil
prices"
