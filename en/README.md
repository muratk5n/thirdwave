Ammonia can be combusted in turbines. Crack it and use H2 in alkaline
fuel-cells. Or in [Toyota combustion-engine cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dgzKW8EKMc).

Brand new ship cost around.. $30 mil? Shipping itself is
cheap. Typical 1GW nuclear plant cost 6 **billion**, Fukushima level
output would cost 30 bil? It's crazy.

---

Example Australia-Japan. Largest ammonia ship can carry 87,000
m3. Ammonia energy density is 4332 kwh/m3, round trip from
Australia-Japan takes two months. 1 ship continuously moving back and
forth can supply to 0.3 GW equivalent, like a pipeline.

30 ships will give 7.7 Gigawatts. Better than one Fukushima.

---

It's possible to create a 'virtual pipeline' through shipping. Ships
constantly go back and forth carrying clean fuel is like a pipeline of
sorts. There is a constant flow within a period of time Like mentioned
before we can compute a Gigawatt measure for that. Compute annual
Watt-hour, divide by 365*24, get Wattage.

On H2 storage \#h2book

[[-]](2022/06/the-h2-revolution-alvera.html#storage)

---

Many fossil players are *also* in the H2 game but that is a good
thing. That means the switch to green energy can be faster, with their
input.  Green fuels are great, there is something in it for
everyone. People will get cheap energy, faster, fossil players build
on their gas/liquid handling expertise and keep making money, and
there will be new players who can innovate and expand, hire.

---

The spread of H2 infrastructure needs to be official left
policy. Renewable gas based tech will deliver cheap energy to people
from all walks of life, especially the poor. 

---

Even with limitless energy we'd need green fuels as an energy
carrier.. We cant have a fusion reactor in every car, in every home,
so cars would need a fuel in the tank that was generated by
fusion. From fusion reactor to homes something needs to be piped in,
fast, efficiently.  That something is still H2.

"Nick Hawker might have solved the nuclear fusion equation, leading to
‚Äòunlimited‚Äô clean energy.. There‚Äôs a new fusion kid on the block. His
name is Nick Hawker and he carries a very big gun ‚Äì 22m long. It fires
a projectile at around 7km/s and aims to hit a bullseye only two atoms
wide.

Fusion, of course, is nothing new. The sun has been at it for the last
few billion years and is still going strong, producing vast amounts of
energy..  The fundamental fact [is].. that fusing two hydrogen nuclei
together is hard. They are both positively charged particles and
therefore mutually repulsive...

In contrast, Hawker and his crew have come up with a radically
different approach to pulling off fusion and ‚Äúgetting it done‚Äù sooner
too. ‚ÄúProjectile fusion‚Äù as practised at First Light, in comparison
with ‚Äúmagnetic confinement fusion‚Äù is simpler, cheaper...

Hawker has taken the concept of the pistol shrimp ‚Äì or the shrimp‚Äôs
claw ‚Äì and converted it into an extremely long pistol, a light gas
gun, with a barrel 22m long, that propels a projectile at around 7km/s
into a cube of fusion fuel, turning it into thermal plasma, which is
so dense that it approaches the density of the core of the sun. When
the projectile hits the outer layer of the cube it produces a shock
wave bubble ‚Äì just like the shrimp ‚Äì that then compresses the fusion
fuel and under huge pressures and very high temperature for a
billionth of a second causes ions to fuse and release energy"

Pretty cheap for life-long visa access.

Everything is for sale these days

Al Monitor: "Fearing visa hassles could cost him his job in Dubai
while an economic collapse had dashed any homecoming options, Lebanese
executive Jad splurged around $135,000 on a new citizenship for
himself and his wife. Within a month of making the payment last year,
the 43-year-old businessman received a small package in his
mailbox. Inside were two navy blue passports from the Caribbean island
nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis -- his ticket to visa-free access to
more than 150 countries, including in Europe"

Talking code, or code-friendly descr is always better then verbal
descriptions, "if it goes up, this goes down, if down, other up" ???
WTF?

What is the angle of the dangle?

---

Some quant-fu uses moving averages, "when close is over MA200 bull, if
not bear" sort of stuff.

---

Tried it - meh; "A drawdown with at least a 20% fall in it" could capture it
better perhaps.. 

"When the market is down 20% for at least a two-month period. 'If
somebody were to say that we were in a bear market in the S&P 500,
that means that we were down 20% from peak to trough,' says
[expert]. 'Once it crosses 20%, you stay 20% or you go further
down. You‚Äôre just in a bear market'"

What is the definition of bear market anyway?

Yep. Don't [jog](2010/04/new-evolution-diet-devany.html) like a

"Living at high altitude and getting vaccinated both help you live
longer - but the most influential factor is exercise..he recommends
high intensity interval training (HIIT workouts)" 

---

From Nicklas Brendborg, *Jellyfish Age Backwards*.

"People who take multivitamins also seem to die earlier - perhaps
because of the iron in them. Iron, Brendborg says, 'works almost like
fertiliser for the growth of bacteria'. This could also explain why
blood donors tend to live longer, as they get rid of excess iron"

I bet RU has good intel too; not just satellite, SIGINT, but leaks
from UKR mil as well. When the "sniper king" Wali went to UKR, he says
nearly got his ass blown up by tanks on first mission, it sounded like
they specifically targeted his area, which means knew he was
there. Right afterwards RU declared him dead (nearly true). My guess
is Wali's location was leaked and RU went after him - for a quick
propaganda win. Now, that kind of intel indicates HUMINT; UKR mil is
leaking like a sieve. Maybe that's not surprising, UKR could have a
lot of RU symphatizers.

They took Popasnaya, now moving ahead to close the small pocket

Al Jazeera: "Russia bombards Severodonetsk from all sides"

You fight artillery with artillery. Also with airbombing, but Ukraine
does not air superiority, Russia does. They can take out rival
artillery units from the air, if not overpower the ones on the ground
with their own ground units (have better numbers, and their supply
line is closer and more secure, right over the border whereas
Ukraine's logistic situation is harder).

"How do you fight against artillery?"
