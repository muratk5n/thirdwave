If there's compounding in play, the resulting values of a measurement
are usually 'anormal'. With trade I'm sure countries build on existing
trades to bring in more, money pulls in more money, stuff just builds
on itself.

.. which is the definition of average... But, the statement only works
if the value is distributed normally (Gaussian, bell curve). With
things such as wealth, and as we saw, trade, half the values are not
below (or above) average.

Steven Wright: “Half the people you know are below average.”

The crazy part is not who's on the trade map, but who isn't. In the
filtered map (of big traders) there is a massive contiguous block of
countries that have no lines going into them. The block starts from
Romania, Serbia goes to East to Pakistan, Afghanistan, in the South to
the entirety of Africa, in the North to Finland and Norway.

US-CH, US-MX, US-CA trade rels are all half a *trillion* USD worth. US
clearly wanted deep trade ties with the two, did 90s NAFTA with CA,MX.
CH is halfway around the world, but the trade amt was just as high.

This fact is so obvious that coal mining accident data before/after
regulation is used as a pedestrian example in statistics - in the
subject of change point analysis. You look at the distribution of
accidents and try to find where distribution shifts from one to
another. Most methods will find a value near 1887 which is exactly
when Coal Mines Regulation Act of 1887 was passed.

"How do we know better regulation improves coal mining accidents?"

Animal fat is great - it's healthy, and necessary. Cultivated animal
fat is even better, without the destructive farming side effects.

"[Startup Hoxton Farms' process] begins by taking a 'harmless handful
of stem cells' from an animal such as a cow or pig and placing them
inside a freezer. There is then enough supply of these cells which
means the animal is no longer needed...Similar to the equipment used
in a brewery, these cells are encouraged to multiply in a cultivator
which then kickstarts the production process [of animal fat]"
