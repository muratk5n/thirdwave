If left doesn't deliver them, some of their issues will be stolen by
others, even by right-wing nationalists, then we end up with
"nationalist socialists". And we all know the acronym for those words
don't we?

---

That is what the left should give you, not constant war and mediocre
half-solutions.

Bus Driver in Brasil: "I voted for Bolsonaro in 2018, because the
economy was in the dumps, I changed my vote to Lula after I survived a
heart attack this year, thanks to the public hospital he built next to
my home"

The joke is "countries have armies, in Pakistan the army has a country"

---

I think at first he thought the interviewer was making a joke, then
realized he wasn't, guy was just clueless

Interviewer asks Pak FM "do you think the army is too involved

a framework agreement to deliver hydrogen distribution systems to a

It is said new admisson and unanimity issues go hand in hand. Can't
admit new members if existing members are wary they'd hold off
important decisions with their vote.. To get over the deadlock, voting
scheme can be changed. Although I admit I enjoy seeing Hungary partly
holding off hare-brained schemes like the EU sanctioning itself into a
recession, with majority voting maybe such issues can get solved
differently, who knows? There might be countries now who are letting
Hungary play the bad guy, go along with stupid, while keeping a low
profile. They might act differently under a different scheme.

The tax policy is seen as a German concession afaik bcz the issue is
near and dear to them (likely related to DE liking of thrift)

WION: "Olaf Scholz calls for reforms within the EU: Bats for new
admissions and military autonomy.. Speaking at the Congress of the
Party of European Socialists in Berlin, Scholz advocated for gradually
abolishing the principle of unanimity for decisions in foreign policy,
but also in other areas such as tax policy"
