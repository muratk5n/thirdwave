ABC AU: "Andrew Forrest says big companies are 'forcing' customers to
'destroy the planet.. "All I'm saying to the fossil fuel sector is, if
you're like the single-use plastic sector, if you're like Coca-Cola
and you just give single-use plastic as your container for Coke, then
you're forcing your customers to be single-use plastic nature
destroyers".. Coca-Cola is one of the sponsors for the UN Climate
Change Conference â€” a move which has drawn criticism from climate
activists..

Mr Forrest is investing in solar farms to lay the groundwork for
Fortescue Future Industries to be producing 15 million tonnes of green
hydrogen by 2030"

Leary, *Pharmageddon*: "On the surface medical practice appears the
same but underneath itâ€™s not. For instance, a small number of people
have a genetic disorder that leads to excessively high cholesterol
levels and for them drugs like the statins can save lives.. For the
most part, however, the statins are instead given to healthy people
who have mild elevations of their cholesterol levels. Similarly,
treatments for asthma or osteoporosis are now given to many people who
would never have been diagnosed and treated before.  Treatment happens
now in response to results on a series of tests that have emerged in
recent yearsâ€”but these new tests donâ€™t help make a diagnosis that will
lift a threat to our lives. Instead they effectively make a diagnosis
of some drug deficiency disorder, and they often enter medical
practice as part of the marketing strategy for a new drug.

These new diseases and their treatments have gained a purchase on us
because they are presumed to represent the latest advances in a story
of progress that runs through insulin and the antibiotics and will
hopefully lead someday to cures for cancer. These are the drugs that,
had they been available, some presume might have saved many of my
fatherâ€™s generation. But far from saving either their lives or ours,
clinical trials show that the indiscriminate use of drugs to lower
lipids or blood sugars, to relieve respiratory wheeze, or to block
stress hormones may even increase the risk of loss of life, and appear
to be doing so in the United States, the country that makes the
greatest use of the latest pharmaceuticals, where since the mid-1970s
life expectancy has been falling progressively further behind other
developed countries"

Dems post-2016 were also "election-deniers" weren't they? They blamed
Russian meddling and questioned the legitimacy of the election. What
goes around comes around.
