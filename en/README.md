Most of those ew-money-printing-bad-so-bad-poop-fiat-hyperflation
crowd u see in "certain media" are serving the interests of an
anti-dollar lobby, not-leading powers jealous their currency is not
the main one. Printing per-se isn't bad, the issue is who you print it
*for*. There is always printing. Plus developed countries aren't
foolish enough to end up like bleeping Venezuella. So if there is
inflation, we can suspect wage increases, or supply issues, or both.

White House staffers are now rewriting the legislation without that
climate provision, and are trying to cobble together a mix of other
policies that could also cut emissions"
