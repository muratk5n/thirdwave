The study confirms the optimal transport capability of H2; we can
project that scenario to onshore-onshore as well.. Producing green
fuel in North Africa pipelining it into Europe, or within the states
of US. See [Wires vs Pipes](2019/03/wirespipes.html).

Aquaventus: "In all three dimensions examined, offshore electrolysis
with pipeline connection emerges as the best approach: According to
the study, a pipeline for hydrogen generated offshore can be realized
up to five and a half years faster than submarine cable connections
for offshore electricity.. In addition, the investment would require
up to 6 billion euros less, reducing the production costs for green
hydrogen. From a permitting perspective and with a focus on
environmental protection, 610 kilometres of pipeline versus 3720
kilometres of high-voltage lines as well as the location of
electrolysis on the high seas also mean significant advantages in
terms of environmental impact"

"40% of the American public has less than a thousand dollars of savings
and they rent. Those people are seeing a huge reverse wealth effect
because.. they don't own a home they don't have a stock
portfolio. Because of the inflationary spurt through 2021 their
paycheck bought less and less they had a huge reverse wealth effect. I
think now FED policy is now oriented towards those 40 percent they
need to get inflation down.. Now we've got the politicians demanding
that they raise rates and raise rates aggressively to deal with
inflation because that 40 percent is behind" \#JimBianco

"@TheRealHoarse

Infant formula is a near monopoly. It is an oligopoly. Two main
producers. They serve a captive market without real alternatives...

People have no idea how many industries have consolidated down to only
a few very large players. The results are anti-competitive. The infant
formula shortage isn’t the crisis. The crisis is the country’s willful
failure to regulate capitalism. A formula shortage because of one
hiccup at one producer is just a symptom.

Davis: "In the modern era of warfare, there are a few key factors that
almost always result in victory for the side that best employs
them. In this war, Russia has advantages over the Ukraine armed in
important categories that will be hard for the UAF to overcome. First
is a clear Russian command of the skies. Yes, as many have pointed
out, Russia was unable to completely knock out the Ukrainian air
defenses, but they have badly degraded them such that Russia is
routinely able to fly between 200 to 300 sorties per day.

About a month ago, there was much notoriety that Ukraine had gained
the use of 20 fighter jets owing to supply parts provided by the
West. Yet there has been no apparent increase in the number of
Ukrainian jets attacking Russian positions beyond the five to 10 per
day reported earlier in the war. The reason is clear: Russian air
defense capabilities remain fully in tact and employ modern S-400
systems that makes any attempt to fly by Ukrainian pilots a likely
death sentence. Ukrainian air defenses still exist, but were badly
degraded at the start of the war, and continue to be knocked out by
Russian attacks. These realities underscore how hard it would be for
Ukraine to reverse the momentum in the Donbas"
