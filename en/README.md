The clapping for Karzai photo shared previously was not a dig in admin
for quitting on an ally. It was about US invading and staying giving
ppl false hope against entrenched forces, and not helping a country
properly when they could.

*War Machine* paints the screw up that was the US involvement in AFG
well. The McMahon-Karzai scene; the general is just another US
official meddling.. US did not help the country, institutionally was
not capable. Another scene, general asks someone about growing an
alternate crop to poppy seed, the response was cotton is suitable, but
Congress will not let USAID help grow a product that will compete with
US farmers.

I searched for that exact quote in *The Operators*, movie's source
material, not there, but there is the story around few brave officials
[in this book](2023/01/little-america-chandrasekaran.html#cotton) who
tried to push cotton to supplant poppy in Afghanistan, and failing
thanks to USAID torpedoing the idea.

A German Pope trying to mend relations with Russians (their church)?
No no no.. That is a no-go my friend... Europe had to be *fighting*
Russians, not mend relations. Then Benedict resigned. ðŸ¤¨

Newsweek: "At the start of Benedict's tenure in 2007, the
newly-installed pope met with Putin for what was considered at the
time to be the highest-level Kremlin-Vatican talks in more than three
years, with the pair focused on easing tension between Roman Catholics
and Orthodox Christians in the country"

All this stuff needs enforcement

[NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/12/business/private-equity-taxes.html):
"Private Inequity: How a Powerful Industry Conquered the Tax
System The I.R.S. almost never audits private equity firms, even as
whistle-blowers have filed claims alleging illegal tax avoidance"

[Market Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/irs-misses-substantial-tax-evasion-by-the-wealthiest-americans-this-study-calculates-just-how-much-11616502277):
"IRS misses â€˜substantialâ€™ tax evasion by the wealthiest Americans â€” far
more than the average worker"

[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-15/peter-thiel-gamed-silicon-valley-tech-trump-taxes-and-politics):
"According to IRS rules, if a Roth IRA account holder engages in a
prohibited transactionâ€”like using the money to invest in a company you
legally controlâ€”then that person loses the tax break for the entirety
of the portfolioâ€™s value. In Thielâ€™s case that would mean he could be
on the hook for a tax bill in the billions"
