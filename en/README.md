"China’s coastline in the East China Sea lacks the deep-water ports
needed to service its naval bases located there. Its submarines must
operate on the surface until they are able to submerge and dive deep
when they reach the area of the Ryukus archipelagoes. If China
controlled Taiwan, its submarines would have a far easier exit from
Taiwan’s deep-water ports into the Pacific. They could present a new
danger for Japan – which is totally dependent on the East Asia
sea-lanes for its energy and other raw materials"

China and France power-equality analysis can help filter out noise, eg
the overused "superpower" label.. China is not a superpower, France
isn't one either. FR has good capability to be sure, just not SP. The
EU however is one (in econ, could be in mil too one day), FR benefits
from that. Ergo if China wanted to project power, has to join others.
But such neighbors / allies are scant.

Rifkin: "The term 'consumption' has both English and French roots. In
its original form, to consume meant to destroy, to pillage, to subdue,
to exhaust. It is a word steeped in violence and until the present
century had only negative connotations. [In the past the word was]
used to refer to the most deadly disease of the day -- tuberculosis"
