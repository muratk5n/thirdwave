NYT: "[Biden] made it clear that most of the 2,500 American troops
currently stationed in Iraq would remain, simply reclassified on paper
into advisory and training roles. The United States’ role, he said,
would be “to continue to train, to assist, to help, and to deal with
ISIS as it arrives.'..

But in the conflict in Iraq, another decades-old war that many view as
more costly than the one in Afghanistan, he sees an American presence
as necessary, at least in part, to ward off the influence of Iran and
the continuing threat of the Islamic State"

@SenWarren says the longer the U.S. waits to regulate cryptocurrencies
'the more likely they will become so intertwined in our financial
system that there could be potentially serious consequences if this

"@johnmrushing

Silos—even potentially empty ones—force your opponent to expend
weapons incapacitating them. You can’t force your opponent to expend
weapons on forces they can’t track

'@Cape_Dread

I thought mobile missiles was the best way, not silos, which are fixed
in position'"

"@A_Andromeda_guy

Russia has got to have concerns about this sort of expenditure as they
have actually fought a war against China whereas the US has not, and
those missiles could just be easily aimed at Moscow during a border
dispute"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
