Hydrogen fuel tank visible. The brand will exhibit a hydrogen-powered

MD can scale both ways; either through seperate name groups / blocks,
or internally for each block adding extra hardware. Twitter, Facebook
can only scale internally, which makes them monolithic,
architecturally lacking in capability.

---

BTW when ppl speak of "adding Mastadon servers" they usually mean a
new name, a new URL. But technically speaking that name, that access
point could also be scaled internally by adding "more physical server
machines", same way netflix.com can be scaled behind the scenes, user
is rerouted to a cluster of machines in the background.

"@Polychrome@poly.cybre.city The bit about a lawyer being stopped from
entering a music hall in the US because its facial recognition system
picked up that she's part of a law company that's suing them is even
crazier than I thought. The law company isn't suing the music hall -
it's suing a restaurant, in another state, which is owned by the
hall's parent company MSG Entertainment. MSG gone ahead and harvested
photos of all the lawyers in the firm and fed it to an image
recognition system to ban them from every MSG Entertainment owned
location"

MSM started using "tycoon", "mogul" to label SBF, they are trying to
hide their fuck-ups by continuing to build up SBF when in fact it was
a stupid kid who was connected, and a wave of followers rushed into
that biz bcz of those connections. Another case of Theranos, or 2010s
Tesla.

Sagan quote reminds me of people who are conned into battery-electric
technology.

---

Carl Sagan: "One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve
been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the
bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The
bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge,
even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken"

Evolution is wild.

LA Times: In Alaska, wood frogs freeze for seven months, thaw and hop
away.. Each September, the wood frogs of Alaska do a very strange
thing: They freeze. They do not freeze totally solid, but they do
freeze mostly solid. Two-thirds of their body water turns to ice. If
you picked them up, they would not move. If you bent one of their
legs, it would break.

Inside these frozen frogs other weird physiological things are going
on. Their hearts stop beating, their blood no longer flows and their
glucose levels sky rocket.

“On an organismal level they are essentially dead,” said Don Larson, a
graduate student at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks who studies
frogs. “The individual cells are still functioning, but they have no
way to communicate with each other.”

The craziest thing of all may be that in this frozen state, they can
withstand temperatures as low as zero degrees Fahrenheit for as long
as seven months, and then, when spring arrives, thaw out and hop away.
