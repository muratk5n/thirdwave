Because charging is slow, they need to apply too much power, to
recharge faster. That will overburden the grid, also degrade the
battery. Finally ka-boom!

National Geographic: "At high charging speeds lithium batteries can
overheat, causing them to degrade over time.. [N]ot only can that
drastically reduce the battery’s capacity... dendrites can grow across
the electrolyte, touch the cathode and create a short circuit, causing
the battery to catch fire or explode"

Münchner Verkehrsgesellschaft (MVG) is now taking eight electric buses
out of service as a precaution.. In Stuttgart, the electric charging
station was destroyed in the fire on September 30th. Therefore, no
electric buses are currently in use"
