Bloomberg: "Biden Has ‘Almost Guaranteed’ Hydrogen’s Future..  The law
[IRA], which provides producers with tax credits of as much as $3 a
kilogram, 'almost guarantees that hydrogen will be an important energy
vector going forward,'.. [said] head of industrial transition and
clean fuels at Macquarie’s Green Investment Group"

PV Magazine: "The German government has decided to collaborate with
the private sector on the construction of an import terminal for green
ammonia in Hamburg. From 2026, the terminal will import green ammonia
from Saudi Arabia. Air Products will produce the ammonia and
distribute it to end users in Germany, mostly for conversion into
hydrogen. '[This] is a strong signal for the entire hydrogen market in
Germany and Europe,' said Robert Habeck, the federal minister of
economics and climate protection"

Other sci branches have improved, have to add that, many became
mathematical, numerical.

Now, IMO the "beauty argument" pushed in sci circles must have been
there to offset the "shut up and compute" crowd. We could argue the
beauty argument was overdone as well, essentially they simply called
for an economy in the formulation where if two explanations were
equally correct choosing the simpler one... but the excess must have
been there to balance the opposite.

The creation of QED also marks the shift of sci center from Europe to
US, and it so happens that the culture code of technology in US is IT
WORKS meaning doesnt matter how something is made, if it works, it's
fine. Not to be too discriminating here but I think the Europeans are
a little more into architecting, economy in their base frameworks.

Looking at the history of QED, it's understandable where the 'shut up
and compute' idiom came from - I dont think this chestnut was
specifically QM related. It has more to do with QED. Bcz remember what
is QED?  A bizarrely convoluted process that formulizes something (the
so-called Feynman diagrams were the necessary simplifying tool for the
unnecessarily complex procedure) but "it worked" so at that point you
had to "shut up and compute".

These old Meloni videos.. They keep circulating them and they come
across as if they were made today.. There is one on La7 from 2019,
another from that Atreju18 thing.. Afaik one was triggered bcz Macron
bashed her first. Good Medi drama.

Which came first: CFD for Aero or Finite Elements for Structures?
According to book by Tenek and Argyris FEM stress analysis on airplane
wings was first. The CFD stuff arrived later. And some could claim
wind tunnels are still preferable for FD.

Two countries on the same island, one is doing well the other
doesn't.. And now there is a border wall between them. Unbelivable..

Bloomberg: "A 101-Mile Wall Goes Up to Block Haitians Pouring Over
Border.. Haitians fleeing [to East].. will soon be met with a
13-foot-tall border wall meant to keep them out of the neighboring
Dominican Republic"
