The Herald: "Ministers have unveiled a plan to help Scotland become a
world leader in hydrogen production which they say could generate up
to £25 billion a year and provide more than 300,000 jobs.

The blueprint, published yesterday, sets out the sets they will take
to help meet the target of producing a sixth of the country's power
needs from hydrogen by 2030, some 5 Gigawatts.

A further goal is to produce 25 Gigawatts of hydrogen by 2045 - the
year the Scottish Government want the county to be net zero"

Smart how they compared different items on a multivariable plot (the
one shared below); each variable is a corner, better/worse numeric
values bring you further or closer to the center, you want the best
item to be on the outside, a connected ring envoloping all the others
in that web, (clearly DBT in this plot).

Compressed H2 is ok for short trips that can be made frequently due to
max capacity I'm reading about, it looks suitable for eg Oz-Japan not
as much for SA-Japan. I made some calcs below for 40 trips / year and
a fleet of 20 ships, using 250 bar H2 having 700 kwh/m3,

```python
capacity = 120000 #m3
print ("Single ship %0.1f MW" % ((ship * 700) / (365*24*1e3)))
ann_trips = 40
print ("Fleet capacity %0.1f GW" % ((20 * ann_trips * capacity * 700) / (365*24*1e6)))
```

```text
Single ship 9.6 MW
Fleet capacity 7.7 GW
```

"@GutoOwenH2

The true test of an energy system is not the easy stuff but the
worst-case scenario. Resilience being the 1ary metric. The Herculean
efforts of the grid engineers is a failure of the system. And the
Pathé News-style spin would be laughable, if it was not so
serious. It's 2022"

"@DickWinchester

This must be nearly a week now and yet there are still some who insist
electrification is the way forward when we know hydrogen can work so
much better for people"

Electric lines, the grid even looks bad, crooked.

BBC: "Still 1,600 Shetland properties without power.. Some homes on
the west side of Shetland's mainland may not have power back until
Monday.. About 150 engineers are now battling snow and ice to rebuild
Shetland's overhead power lines and reconnect properties to the
network"
