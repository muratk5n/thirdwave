@Alstom

\#DYK that our Coradia iLint \#hydrogen fuel cell powered passenger
train fleet has already completed over 200,000 kilometres of passenger
service? That’s nearly equal to five times around the planet Earth!

"@Alstom

Along smoothly on our Alstom Coradia iLint distance record run with
1,077 kms clocked. We can now say that we have established a
\#worldrecord 🏆"

@Alstom

This just in from \#TeamAlstom - We've reached a whopping 970km.. on a
single \#hydrogen filling.

BTW "described statistically as a random process" was done to compute
faster (they surely know the process isn't random). Because for fluid
dynamics we have the equations that describe the whole process.. To
simulate turbulance, need fine detail, and that becomes computationally
costly, in some cases impossible to compute.

What these guys did find patterns within turbulence so it could be
computed efficiently. Every model is a summary, a shortcut, these guys
found a shortcut within the shortcut.

Turbulence is deterministic, of course.. that surprises exactly noone
who took a Nonlinear Dynamics course.

"[P]hysicists [of Gatech] have demonstrated — numerically and
experimentally — that turbulence can be understood and quantified with
the help of a relatively small set of special solutions to the
governing equations of fluid dynamics that can be precomputed for a
particular geometry, once and for all.

'For nearly a century, turbulence has been described statistically as
a random process,' said [scientist]. 'Our results provide the first
experimental illustration that, on suitably short time scales, the
dynamics of turbulence is deterministic — and connects it to the
underlying deterministic governing equations.'"

WION: "As a result of the deepening ties between Russia and China, the
yuan is becoming much more popular as Moscow tries to ditch its
post-Soviet addiction to cash US dollars. On the basis of a 50-50
split between the Russian rouble and Chinese yuan, Putin said last
week that China will pay Gazprom for its gas in national
currencies. After successfully completing its debut yuan-denominated
bond placement worth 15 billion yuan ($2.15 billion), Russia's largest
oil producer Rosneft said it was gradually shifting to foreign trade
settlements in Russian roubles and national currencies of "friendly"
countries. While Russia's largest gold producer Polyus issued bonds
denominated in the Chinese yuan worth 4.6 billion yuan (670 million
dollars), the country's aluminium producer Rusal tapped the yuan bond
market on the Moscow Exchange"
