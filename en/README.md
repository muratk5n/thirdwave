Paper: "Cost of long-distance energy transmission by different
carriers.. This paper compares the relative cost of long-distance,
large-scale energy transmission by electricity, gaseous, and liquid..
carriers. The results indicate that the cost of electrical
transmission per delivered MWh can be up to eight times higher than
for hydrogen pipelines"

H2 Central: "Liberty Hydrogen has launched with development
plans.. [for] an industrial-scale biomass to green ammonia
facility. The global production capacity of grey ammonia is expected
to expand from around 235 million metric tons in 2019, to nearly 290
million metric tons by 2030. For companies to meet net-zero targets,
ammonia production will need to transition to a low-carbon ‘green’
process. Liberty Hydrogen’s green ammonia facility is targeting a
starting capacity of 100,000 tonnes of green ammonia positioning
itself as a leader in the burgeoning low-carbon ammonia sector."

"German oil and gas company Wintershall Dea and compatriot pipeline
operator Nord-West Oelleitung (NWO) have signed an agreement for the
BlueHyNow hydrogen production plant in Wilhelmshaven... Wintershall
Dea plans a plant for producing large volumes of hydrogen using
Norwegian natural gas"

"A second hydrogen production base in Korea is set to kick off
operations in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, next month, to improve
the supply volume of energy to vehicle charging stations in Seoul and
neighboring cities.

The Pyeongtaek base, located at the Asan Industrial Complex, some 60
kilometers south of Seoul, will have the capacity of providing 430,000
hydrogen-fueled vehicles, including commercial ones, with energy per
annum, according to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy"

Haha, UK doc about "electricity storage" is talking about H2 a lot.

That will require massive renewable energy generation

"The global green hydrogen market will expand from $2.14bn last year
to 135.73bn by 2031.. according to a new study from Indian/US firm
Transparency Market Research (TMR)... Similar growth was forecast in
April by US analyst Guidehouse Insights, which forecast that the
global manufacturing of electrolysers — the machines that produce
green hydrogen from renewable electricity..

The study adds that solar energy will be the leading source of power
for green hydrogen over the forecasted period, with PEM technology
dominating the electrolyser market"

That's the German Chancelor standing next to a Siemens turbine for a

I believe the poster below used the words "as of 2020" to report a
cumulative number as in **all** renewable elec generated by 2020, not
the annual number. The cumulative is an odd thing to report - you'd do
it of course to inflate your results...

In year 2020 renewable electricity was at 3146 TWh, half of the number
below. 3146 TWh represents 2% of all energy production of that year.

If China consumes twice as much energy as India with about same amt of
people, that means they are producing something in excess, and that
something is goods for the world. The energy to make that stuff mostly
comes from dirty coal.

It seems to me some developed countries simply shifted their polluting
over to China and think they are scotfree. if they really cared about
the environment they would tariff that pollution. Of course that would
be inflationary and/or could mean less shopping. But let's think about
that - do kids really need that Mr. Potatohead toy? Parents can DIY make
it using regular potato.
