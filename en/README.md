Today Sunday July 10, 2022 I saw a TV commercial on ABC during the
This Week with George Stephanopolous show promoting green
\#hydrogen. This is first time ever I have seen such a thing in the
USA and I have been watching very closely. An inflection point in H2
adoption trajectory"

Times of India: "The Adani Group recently made an announcement that it
has partnered with France's TotalEnergies to create a green hydrogen
ecosystem. On the other side, Reliance Industries will also invest Rs
75,000 crore over the next three years to set up a new clean-energy
business...

The government launched the National Hydrogen Energy Mission (NHEM) in
2021-22. This year, the Ministry of Power notified Green Hydrogen
Policy (GHP) and welcomed industry leaders. The policy will help meet
the target of 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen production by 2030"

I'm sure "pro-bidness" governor is fine with that

Texas Tribune: "Texans face skyrocketing home energy bills as the

Left-wing Catholics aren't much of a Catholic but they cling on to the
title, especially if it is part of a minority ethnic position; it's
like a lastname that is passed down, the thing parents say they are
and the thing others call them that "sets them apart". In cultural
terms it matters little, grander society will assimilate no running
away from it. On top of that they go against the teachings. So why
bother?

Turkist ideology was always useful for the Anglo. Imagine you have
bunch of deluded people in a strategic peninsula who think they are
not from there, that will encourage "frontier" mentality in that
country. Frontier for what? Frontier for the Anglo. That is why the
outer alliance likes Turkist ideology - also useful for them in the
Caucuses, Central As against Russia (if it can peel off a few
countries here and there based on "common ethnicity" the better)-. So
this is the reason especially post 80s the state narrative emphasized
turning Kemal into a deitic figure, citizens were supposed to worship
Kemal, and he looks Anglo, so through Kemal you worship the Anglo
(your alliance with them).

Now that I think about it the "Grand Ancestor" Kemal looks Anglo

"@DanDePetris

Name a period in U.S. history when human rights were at the center of
U.S. foreign policy. I canâ€™t think of any. A lot of presidents insist
that human rights serve as a foundation. Then they realize that, gosh,
working with autocracies is an unavoidable part of the job"
