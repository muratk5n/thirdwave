an investigation over safety concerns after a string of e-scooter
fires, including one in which a man and his daughter died when their
e-bike 'went up in flames'".

George Ellis: "Theoretical physics and cosmology find themselves in a
strange place. Scientific theories have since the seventeenth century
been held tight by an experimental leash. In the last twenty years or
so, both string theory and theories of the multiverse have slipped the
leash. Their owners argue that this is no time to bring these subjects
to heel.

It is this that is strange.

Misery Loves Company

The multiverse is a collection, set, or ensemble of possibly disjoint
universes. They are possible because no one knows whether they
exist. Max Tegmark has contemplated four different kinds of
multiverse, and Brian Greene, nine. Nothing exceeds like excess"
