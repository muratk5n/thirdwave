Newsweek Opinion: "[T]he United States' formal position on the [RU/UA]
conflict has changed markedly little. That overly simplified and
Manichaean position, in short, is one of Ukrainian maximalism: Putin
is evil, Volodymyr Zelensky is noble, andâ€”here is the big logical
leapâ€”the United States will thus support the Ukrainian effort to
retake every square inch of territory in the Donbas and Crimea from
its nuclear-armed adversary, seemingly no matter the cost to the
U.S. taxpayer...

At this stage in the war, virtually all of this pablum is asinine and
counterproductive to the actual U.S. national interest in these
contested areas. Our national interest in the Ukrainian theater is not
coterminous with Zelensky's absolutist stance; our interest is for
de-escalation, detente"

Or.. it's like *Office Space* being filmed inside *Empire Strikes
Back*. There is a Luke and Vader fight going on which we don't see,
this is the cut to an imperial office somewhere inside Death Star
where a buttoned up office guy yelling 'why is this printer not
working!!  [nervously presses the buttons]', 'f--k this
printer!'. Then his boss walks over and asks him about the TPS report
and dude just starts kicking the printer.

*Andor* feels like an SNL sketch in a *Star Wars* backdrop.

Ukraine too, "liberated" in 2014, they'd have to know RU would get
pulled into that situation, just like they knew Iran would be involved
in Iraq after 2003 "liberation".

Even a child with little intl rel knows invading Iraq would have
pulled Iran into that country, creating chaos.

Basically when PH enabled the device he recognized the self-noise was

Paris Herouni built the first (and still the only) radio-telescope in
Armenia (operational 1987 â€“ 1990). Within moments of turning it on it
detected the explosion of a red giant star (Etta star in Gemini
constellation).

Heritage has little effect in defining culture. Behaviour is mostly
shaped by subconcious codes received through osmosis from the larger
society around, burned into psyche before teenage. The process is
automatic, does not need education, stories, or stupid shit being
mumbled in rote, in robes, or funky hats.

US bizarre distant heritage worship is likely part of a psyop.. If
your citizens think of themselves as near-peer to citizens in other
countries, such population would be more open to persuasion for
intervention in those other countries. It's easy to sell deep state
meddling in Italy, Poland, if you have bunch 2nd, 3rd generation fools
as citizens who still think they are intimately connected to people
there.

Insider: "3 people describe the shock of discovering through at-home
DNA tests that they were a different race than they'd thought.. 'A
match had come up on Ancestry.com. My biological father was a Jewish
man named Rick Estrin... Accepting the fact that I'm not Mexican has
been challenging. My Mexican/Hispanic heritage is tightly intertwined
into my sense of self. The culture is paramount to who I am. I'd
cofounded an activism website called Latino Rebels to bring attention
to issues affecting Latinos'"
