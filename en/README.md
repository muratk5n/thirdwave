Some claim this event triggered seismic changes in history; famine
displaced people who displaced others, discredited some existing
religions increased interest for new ones (eg Islam, note Mohammed was
born in 570).

History Channel: "[I]n 536 A.D., much of the world went dark for a
full 18 months, as a mysterious fog rolled over Europe, the Middle
East and parts of Asia. The fog blocked the sun during the day,
causing temperatures to drop, crops to fail and people to die... 

Now, researchers have discovered one of the main sources of that
fog. The team reported in Antiquity that a volcanic eruption in
Iceland in early 536 helped spread ash across the Northern Hemisphere,
creating the fog. Like the 1815 Mount Tambora eruption—the deadliest
volcanic eruption on record—this eruption was big enough to alter
global climate patterns, causing years of famine.

What exactly did the first 18 months of darkness look like? The
Byzantine historian Procopius wrote that 'the sun gave forth its light
without brightness, like the moon, during this whole year.' He also
wrote that it seemed like the sun was constantly in eclipse"

New Scientist: "In the year 536 the sun dimmed and the world shivered,
leading to famine, plague and the fall of empires"

Sounds like bunch of unnecessary pain.. Test based restrictions are
excessive.. Left over from beginning of pandemic.

TDB: "On the day my wife and I were to fly home from London after a
brief visit, we took a COVID-19 test.. My wife’s test was negative. My
test was positive. She flew out.... So I was looking at 10 days of
hotels, which are not cheap in London. It’s not as if I can call a
friend here and say, “Hey, I got covid. Can I crash on your living
room sofa?”

[Gets covid] My symptoms quickly went away, and after four days I felt
fine again... But, now, how do I get back? Here’s the problem. There
is a chance that some little piece of the virus remains in my body. So
if I take another test and it’s positive, I’m stuck here again—with no
symptoms except a bleeding wallet"

CNBC: "Charlie Munger warns Gen Z investors.. 'It’s going to be way
harder for the group that’s graduated from college now ... to get rich
and stay rich,' Munger, 98, said. 'Think what it [used to] cost to own
a house in a desirable neighborhood in a city like Los Angeles.'"

Summary: Mass is an illusion. Proton, neutrons are the shit. Higgs
Boson is not a big deal.

TDB: "IBM’s Watson, who trounced the greatest Jeopardy! players on the
classic game show—but needed to be hard-wired to the show’s
question-posing system. He was incapable of doing an autonomous task
that any three-year-old could do: listening for the host to finish a
question before buzzing in"

Besides the need to provide bed-time stories for their shoddy
nation-building, Asia Minor Turkist propaganda was useful for British
interests; they could use it as a cudgel for the continuation of the
Great Game in Asia, eg if you can create an illusion of ethnic unity
between TR and "the Stans", some of which are "ethnically similar", u
could then be provoke those countries against their immediate
neighbor. 

But the act is getting old.. Plus TR's problems compound whose very
foundation was crooked (that's what you get with second rate
founders). People live in a bastardized world of their true culture
which is incompatible with national narrative that constantly leads them
astray, or at best, stagnant.

Because US was caught doing undemocratic shit, its protests on the
Egyptian coup were ignored. The revelations might have even given Sisi
the PR cover needed for the coup.

Timeline reminder

June 2013: An NSA contractor Edward Snowden starts sharing gov secrets
with the media. Americans learn that their government was spying
broadly on its own people.

July 2013: A military coup in Egypt removes President Morsi from
power, Morsi is of the Moslem Brotherhood movement, supported by
Qatar.

Looking at the map, Philippines would be key for the outers to contain
China.. But what happens after Duterte?

Orban wins again. He is lambasted on immigration, but on process we
have to accept forcing countries to accept people if their
democratically elected government does not agree to do so would be
undemocratic.

FT: "China has reaffirmed its partnership with Russia in the wake of
the Ukraine invasion and says it wants to push bilateral relations 'to
a higher level'"

---

NYT: "Syrian mercenaries deploy to Russia en route to Ukrainian
battlefields Hundreds of Syrian fighters are en route to join Russian
forces in Ukraine, effectively returning the favour to Moscow for
helping President Bashar Assad crush rebels in an 11-year civil war,
according to two people monitoring the flow of mercenaries"

Moldova is NATO-friendly? If they were opportunistic they would
give Russia access in return for Odessa Oblast. 

---

TBH Ukraine had ownership of some prime land that was beyond its
capacity to hold onto. They needed massive deterrence to keep all
that, or major forsight on diplomacy to make self less threathening to
others (RU). Ukraine had neither.

---

Moldova has been screwed good; had zero sea access until 2005, now
have a *tiny* port, reminds me the bitch borders of Iraq drawn up by
Western powers.. And Moldova had to trade land with Ukraine to get
it. Sad.

In a natural evolution of borders Moldova would have the land reaching
to the Black Sea, which currently belongs to Ukraine.

If the areas in the immediate UKR south are closed off Ukraine loses
all sea access. No wonder Odessa is being attacked.

---

The map suggests a next region for attack would be that pocket shown
with arrow, and yes, Severodonetsk, Rubizhne, Lysychansk, Kreminna,
Hirske, Popasna Berezove, Toshkivka - all being shelled. If RU takes
the region and the red block in the map will get bigger.

MSM is not even providing Liveuamap level reporting here. See the red
regions in the map. Those are RU areas; not newsworth? \#liveuamap

Watching the corporate media you'd think Ukraine is winning big, if
there just had some extra hardware, they'd finish the war today

*The Contractor*, not bad
