is prolonged exposure to microgravity - near zero gravity -
which, combined with exposure to damaging radiation from the Sun,
could cause 'fundamental' changes to the body"

"Norway produces 50% of 'energy' with hydropower!!". When you look
closely it is electricity, not just "energy" and elec consump is at
20%. So now the number goes down to 10% - for a country of 5 million ðŸ¤¨
Is this supposed to impress someone?

---

Of overall *energy* the percentage is actually <4%. Electricity does
not represent all energy consumption (a mere 15% in most
countries). That is why most rosy renewable energy numbers are also
false eg Germany, Norway

"Today the US produces just 7% of its energy from renewables, the
majority from hydroelectric schemes"

It looks like generating things that can be interpreted one way or
another problem (some might call that art) was solved earlier by today's
crude attempts at AI.. Didn't scifi shows and movies have us believe
art was the *last* thing to arrive? The android on Trek tried very
hard to make jokes, create paintings after demonstrating excellent
abilities in strong AI, feats today's algorithms can't even touch. I
guess the only thing the super duper android from 24th century had to
do was use some shit neural network code from 21st century, shove
bunch of data in there, and let it "generate art" for him.

See sample GDELT output files [here](http://data.gdeltproject.org/events).
Pick one, and check `Actor1Name`, `Actor2Name`, and `EventCode`
triplets for every record. I guarantee it half the time they will be
wrong. This is one of the best language models. Use SOTA, and forget
80, 95%, if you can surpass 70% I will eat my hat. 

The codes are documented in this [PDF](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf).

When specific answers are required that have to be true, which is the definition
of (strong) AI, deep neural nets have a huge problem. 

---

It can't do shit. It miscategorizes stuff all the time

"GDELT uses some of the world's most sophisticated natural language
and data mining algorithms, including the world's most powerful deep
learning algorithms, to extract more than 300 categories of events,
millions of themes and thousands of emotions and the networks that tie
them together"

It's funny I helped architect the tigger version of Ticketmaster,
which was eventually acquired by... Ticketmaster. Monop is clearly
their thing, at home and abroad.

---

A recent claim is Ticketmaster monopoly caused an absence of choices
when TX systems went awry and "Swifties" went batshit 

LA Times: "[2010] Ticketmaster-Live Nation merger gets Justice
Departmentâ€™s approval"
