url = "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_topline.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url,parse_dates=True,index_col='modeldate')
df = df[df.subgroup=='All polls']
df = df.sort_index()
df = df[df.index > '2021-01-01']

But imo the ideology, its first inception, quickly [fell out of
favor](2020/04/turks-culture-national-narrative.md#estagfurullah),
stayed that way until well into the 20th century when Kemal and his
cohorts utilized, resurrected the same escapist fantasy to handle a
similar trauma. The empire was gone, and the new nation needed
something "different". The founders served up the nomadic Turk from
faraway lands, just like Nazis had dreamt up the Aryan from Atlantis.

---

The claim is the Otto itself started the Turkist ideology partially in
the 15th century, before the "Grand Ancestor" Kemal. Otto had its ass
kicked back then by Temarlane from Central Asia, so historians
(propagandists) were attempting to say "yeah we are kinda like that
guy, we are from that region too".
