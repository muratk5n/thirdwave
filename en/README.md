Construct the math, formulate concepts and code instead of shoving
data into a black box. This is the way.

TU Munchen: "Researchers.. have developed a model that enables a robot
to serve tea and coffee faster and more safely than humans – with no
sloshing... They based their mathematics on a Moroccan tea tray that
applies the principle of a spherical pendulum.. embed[ding] the
dynamics of a spherical pendulum into the robot’s control
software. That also means that the robot’s movements are limited by
the basic principles of geometry. With his team, he also integrates
the correct angles, speeds and accelerations into the model"

Calcium carbonate is sedimentary rock, iron oxide is a component of
igneous rock, and water. Water can certainly seep down from ocean
floor, and combine with the rest.

This means there is no need for 'fossils' for the production of
hydrocarbons, simple compounds present in the mantle at high pressure
/ temparature will do.

"[2004] We present in situ observations of hydrocarbon formation via
carbonate reduction at upper mantle pressures and
temperatures. Methane was formed from FeO, CaCO3-calcite, and water at
pressures between 5 and 11 GPa and temperatures ranging from 500°C to
1,500°C... The study demonstrates the existence of abiogenic pathways
for the formation of hydrocarbons in the Earth's interior and suggests
that the hydrocarbon budget of the bulk Earth may be larger than
conventionally assumed"
