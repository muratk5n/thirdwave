"SGN has secured funding to deliver a nationally strategic hydrogen
transmission and storage project. In early April, it announced that it
had received £29.9mn from Ofgem and gas distribution companies,
allowing it to test the use of high-pressure pipelines for hydrogen
transmission and storage as an option for net zero heating. The
project, based at Grangemouth in Scotland, will be delivered in
partnership with INEOS"

Some question why we need hydrogen pipelines for offshore renewables

That Levy guy too - one shady fuck. He gave bad advice on Libya, and
dabbled in Syrian affairs too according to some.

Bottom of his heart.. How **sweet**.

Wikileaks: "Sarkozy is the French politician who most supports the
role of the United States in the world.. His nickname is 'Sarkozy the
American' and his affinity for America is authentic and comes from the
bottom of his heart"

Sarko was little stupid, an odd duck.. Certainly no Chirac. After his
term he was dragged through the mud quite a bit, had the crap beaten
out of him.

---

He forgot his country's future lies with the inner alliance, not
meddling outers, and went ahead and helped topple the guy who could be
useful for him / Europe, soon after that very same leader had declared
intensions of opening up Libya and sign energy deals with Europe.

"Sarkozy played a role in Libya's destruction"

How does liveuamap determine occupied regions during coflicts? "[It]
has a method to harvest, select, and curate social media
information... Liveuamap assumes control by drawing a polygon around
events and, given the large number of social media events it contains,
is able to generate areas of control"

[PDF](https://acleddata.com/acleddatanew/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/ACLED_Syria-Map-Methodology_Version2_3.2019-1.pdf	)

---

The RU advance is reverse-engineered from Liveuamap images; given two
known pixel-coordinate mappings, can calculate lat,lon from image. In
small areas it's close enough.

---

```python
import simplegeomap as sm, json

clat,clon=48.70665, 37.5; zoom = 0.27

ukr = json.loads(open("ukraine1.json").read())
ru = np.array(ukr['front']['20220430'])

sm.plot_countries(clat,clon,zoom,outcolor='lavenderblush')
sm.plot_line(ru,color='red',linestyle='dashed')

for city in ['donetsk','luhansk','volnovakha','lyman']:
   c = sm.find_city(city,"ukraine")[0]
   plt.text(float(c[9]),float(c[8]),c[1])
```

Yea.. not looking good; Lyman is nearly inside that front line

Just watched Ukranian guy on Al Jazeera, from the town Lyman near RU
front, said he heard from ppl next town mil gave up, so the advance is
now coming for him
