H2 Fuel News: "[Agency] develops new submarine hydrogen fuel cell
technology.. The South Korean.. agency has created a new form of
methanol reforming plant. The hydrogen used by the submarine fuel cell
technology would be produced using methanol reforming within the
vessel itself. Fuel cells in submarines use high-purity H2 to boost
the amount of time they can spend underwater"

Hopefully with pilots?.. Watch for those S-400s.. one of the most

air superiority with these fighter-jets? NATO itself could not fly

Al Monitor: "Arabs fear for wheat supplies after Russia invades
Ukraine.. Russia's invasion of Ukraine could mean less bread on the
table in Egypt, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere in the Arab world where
millions already struggle to survive. The region is heavily dependent
on wheat supplies from the two countries which are now at war, and any
shortages of the staple food have potential to bring unrest. If those
supplies are disrupted, 'the Ukraine crisis could trigger renewed
protests and instability'"

RU is self-sufficient, have meat, grain production, and hell, lots and
lots of hydrocarbons.

TPDCAMAU, again

"RU will be isolated"

They probably don't care as much as assumed

"RU will become a pariah"

Biden is not talking to MBS? Why not? Bcz he is bad? Had a journo

talking to him afterwards.

Apparently they will get together to give US price gaugers a stern
talking to üòÇ 

Barron's: "Members of the OPEC+ oil producers' group will meet
Wednesday to discuss loosening the taps -- just days after Russia's
invasion of Ukraine sent crude soaring past $100 a barrel"

---

Politico: "After just one day of the invasion, Russia effectively
controlled nearly a third of the world‚Äôs wheat exports.. Importantly,
while hydrocarbon production can be immediately surged in different
places to meet shifts in requirements, grain production cannot be
surged in the same way, and even a major expansion cannot make up for
the sheer volume of agricultural output that Russia now controls
either directly or indirectly.

Most of the focus has rightly been on the invasion‚Äôs impact on people
in Ukraine‚Äôs most populous cities ‚Äî but in the background, Russia is
completing a hostile takeover of the country‚Äôs grain-rich regions and
their associated transportation infrastructure...

[T]here are only two points of maritime access that Russia needs to
dominate in order to be in control of Ukrainian grain shipments: the
Kerch Strait that connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov, and the
17 ports in and around Odessa.

As of Thursday, Russia had closed access to the Sea of Azov, and, ...
Ukraine has closed all its commercial ports. Ukrainian grain is now
offline"

Near history:

Aug 2010: Once in a century draught in Russia devastated wheat crops
forcing Russia announce a ban on wheat export. 80% of Middle East's
wheat came from Russia.

occurred in Tunisia, following a street vendor's self-immolation

will boost defense spending and create a strategic natural-gas

If it is not important why are some trying to expand it? It clearly
*means* something to be in it, as well as outside, and it is
potentially against someone, even in defensive form.

"But NATO is not that important, RU is making a big deal of it"

It was the former IMO

Mustache is now saying 'Trump was too buddy-buddy with Putin but we

What more could they occupy? Beyond Belarus and Ukraine there is
NATO. Putin wont attack a NATO country - he is not stupid. On the
other side, NATO already expanded as far it could, reaching its
limit. Right? Otherwise UKR's NATO membership would be
discussed.. That clearly did not happen, not after 6/2021 by this
President, not even after 2014 after Ukraine lost pieces of itself to
Russia. On the downside the current limbo status is not enough to
deter, creates further chaos. It is probably a good idea to finalize
it now.

"But will giving in on UKR neutrality entice RU to attack more?"

Yeah - there are still no Nazis in Ukraine... Barking up the wrong tree son

Luigi Mengele vs Dr. Oz in a debate? I'd watch that.
