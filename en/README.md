Comparing the capacity of that three-dome LH2 carrier to crude; 1
barrel of oil is 136 kg. Energy density of crude oil 10 kwh/kg.  Small
crude tanker size is 100K barrels. Liquid hydrogen has a an energy
density of 2216 kwh/m3, ship carry capacity of 37,500m3 means,


```python
100*1000 * 136 * 10 / 1e6 # gwh
```

```text
Out[1]: 136.0
```

```python
2216*37500 / 1e6 # gwh
```

```text
Out[1]: 83.1
```

136 gwh vs 83 gwh capacity.. It's getting there..
