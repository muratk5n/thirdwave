"As long as the Islamic terrorists remain in Idlib, [ISIS] in the east
and Iranians near the Israeli border, the Syrian civil war will not be
over... Iran wants to repeat in Syria what it has been doing in Yemen
for several years. In Yemen Iran perfected an effective way to attack
Saudi Arabia by arming Shia rebels in Yemen with over a thousand
ballistic missiles and UAVs... Iran is seeking to carry out a similar
campaign against Israel using Iran backed militias in Syria"

Lectures can be viewed at school just as easily as they are viewed at
home. The key is content, and who delivers it.

"Children going to school" isn't preferred bcz it is better for their
education. Parents need it because in a modern setting, school
functions as a day-care center, somewhere they can drop their children
off and go to work, whereever.

If they want better education, they should ask for prerecorded lecture
videos of the experts to teach their children rather than a
parrot/imbecile wildly gestulating (teacher)

I'd seen the actress J. Alexander way before, in a little show called
Kyle XY..  She was great, with that statuesque look.. The only
negative, a bit chubby in places.. But she made an excellent
transition to her next phase, w demanding action, and looks quite
fit. I'm impressed.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
