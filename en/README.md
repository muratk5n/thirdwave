"Consumer prices in [DE] have been increasing for months, fueled by

They need to include this 'energy' in hurricane reporting, as in how
much mass is moving when hurricane makes landfall. Kinetic energy is
$1/2 m v^2$, increase mass increase energy. Would one rather get hit
with baloon or a hammer at the same speed?

"Hurricane Katrina was a 'huge storm' with a 'very expansive' wind
field compared to an average storm.. Hurricane Ida strengthened
rapidly in the hours before it made landfall, whereas Katrina did the
opposite, strengthening to a Category 5 over the Gulf of
Mexico.. 'Hurricane Katrina.. was significantly larger, and had more
energy associated with it'"

came upon the Igel seismology book, he is also diggin the DG[/geek]

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
