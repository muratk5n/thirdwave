H2 View: "JBIC invests $108m in Hy24 to support the â€˜worldâ€™s largestâ€™
clean hydrogen infrastructure investment fund. The Japan Bank for
International Cooperation (JBIC) has revealed plans to invest up to
â‚¬100m (108m dollars) into a clean hydrogen infrastructure fund"

H2 View: "Egypt could be set to grow its hydrogen economy with the
revealing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to assess low-carbon
hydrogen production in the country. Signed by the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the company will support Egypt
in achieving its renewable energy potential with masses of solar
energy production which can then be turned into hydrogen"

H2 View: "100 hydrogen fuel cell cold-chain logistic vehicles have

H2 View: "A major new hydrogen project in the US is set to be
developed in Texas.. Dubbed Hydrogen City, the project is being
developed by Green Hydrogen international (GHI) and will include
integrated green hydrogen production, storage, and transportation
capabilities.. able to produce 2.5 billion kilogrammes of green
hydrogen each year...

Included within the project is the development of a hydrogen storage
facility in the Piedras Pintas Salt Dome. From this facility,
pipelines will deliver the green hydrogen to Corpus Christi and
Brownsville where it will be turned into green ammonia, sustainable
aviation fuel and other fuels... This also opens up opportunities to
potentially be directly transported to hydrogen power plants and other
users around the state"

H2 Fuel News: "Israel to roll out new hydrogen powered trucks.. The
introduction of the vehicles is the result of a new deal among

---

The road towards the conflict was full of images of EU getting cucked
on energy.  "We'll cut your pipeline (NS2)", "we'll find you natgas if
things go awry (from Qatar, while tying them into NATO in the
process)". We'll take care of you boy.. Don't you worry.. Are you
happy now, feel taken care of, BOY?

---

I repeat the scenario. This whole ordeal can still be an answer to a
long-running ploy to cut off EU/RU energy relation.. RU gets tired of
the little blocks, delays here and there, throws down the
gauntlet. 'We either form a good relationship, or there is trouble'

---

And I wonder why...

UK.gov: "Unlike other countries in Europe, the UK is in no way
dependent on Russian gas supply... There are no gas pipelines directly
linking the UK with Russia and imports from Russia made up less than
4% of total UK gas supply in 2021"

---

UK sounds more enthusiastic on banning RU energy

---

I'm glad Germany denied the ban.

---

I really wanted to see RU part of this whole H2/NH3 transition..
Latest events can be a huge bummer on that angle.

All those relations could not stop (allegedly fueled) a World War, one
would assume relatives holding high positions in each country could
act as natural ambassadors to eachother's countries, but no. They failed
and mostly disappeared.

---

They are all related, like inbred probably, everybody's somebody
else's mother, half-brother, father, cousin, they they all have weird
relations, maybe including the royal goat (royalty is a product of
agrarian era, you never know what goes on in there in those palaces).

I first saw this angle in a 2021 movie in all places, *The King's Man*,
pretty well done movie historically.

End of WWI saw the fall of two of those monarchs, and others too in
Europe. Maybe they got what they deserved, paid the price for their
uselessness.

"Was WWI caused by a family feud?

Far from being remote rulers who knew nothing of their enemies, the
heads of state of Britain, Germany and Russia â€“ George V, Kaiser
Wilhelm II and Tsar Nicholas II â€“ were first cousins who knew one
another very well.

A BBC documentary screened in 2018, *Royal Cousins at War*, told the
story of Wilhelm's difficult relationship with his parents and
antipathy towards all things British and argues that this helped bring
the world to the brink of war.

The three monarchs were like 'sleepwalkers stepping towards an open
lift shaft', Richard Davenport-Hines says in his review of Miranda
Carter's book on the subject, *The Three Emperors*. The events leading
pup to the conflict are 'a study in the envy, insincerity, festering
rancour and muddle that only families can manage'.

Unlike many family feuds, however, disagreements between the royal
cousins exacted a geopolitical price. 'As relationships between the
royal cousins waxed and waned, so did the relationships between their
countries,' the Daily Mail's Ruth Styles says"

Jane's Defense: "Russia has established an unprecedented
command-and-control (C2) structure to co-ordinate its multipronged
invasion of Ukraine. For the first time it is simultaneously running a
major operation through the headquarters of four military districts,
which are the equivalent of four-star headquarters in Western military
organisations. These new command arrangements have significantly
contributed to the slow rate of advance of the Russian forces in the
opening phase of the war, according to senior Western intelligence
sources"

Zelensky might have been had by that drone help by Anatolians, which
itself might have been spurred by Brits. They weren't helping you out
of the goodness of their hearts.. If shit hit the fan over there that
would be good for them bcz that would mean less pressure on Idlib
(which Russia/Assad want to take back). Then there is the energy
ploy.. Your war was someone else's gain.
