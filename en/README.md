Produce clean ammonia, it can transmit H2, and be used for
refigration. That is cool - as in refigrator cool.

"HFC refrigerants can be expensive to manufacture and have significant
negative environmental impact. This paper presents the results of a
field demonstration of an ammonia-based process cooling system in a
food process- ing industrial application. The ammonia system is over
20 % more efficient than comparable HFC based process cooling systems"

---

Guess what, ammonia fixes that problem too.. it can replace hydrofluorocarbons cleanly.

Good good..

Politico: "While the Senate is badly divided on most climate issues,
strong backing from the business community to eliminate
hydrofluorocarbons, known as HFCs, aligned with environmentalists‚Äô
agenda to help secure enough Republican support to meet the
Constitution‚Äôs requirement of two-thirds support"

*Andor*.. One Rotten Tomatoes comment says "[it] is slow and boring" -
I agree... It's like watching a *Law and Order* episode in the
backdrop of *The Usual Suspects*. The one positive aspect though is
*Andor* isn't cuck.

Can trade on noise.. Every up has a down, it is known where series is
coming back to. Buy at the mean sell after certain $\sigma$.

---

Noise is mean reverting BTW (noise, as in, eg Gaussian $N(0,\sigma)$)

---

Can create mean-reverting series using eigenvectors (calculated in a
certain way, wont detail here) combining various price data. Dam. \#quant

It's open season on Trump. I am not sure if they are targeting him, or
trying to crowd out coverage for other Reps in general.

There won't be a green transition even with all the lithium mined. The
reserves are insufficient (enough only for 5% of all storage needs).

Exclusive use of clean fuels will however allow a green transition.

I think all the numbers below, except the iStories one, are full of
shit. It reminds me the ailment, Putin body-double

Troop shifting around Kharkiv, Donbas likely had to do trying to cover
a huge area with insufficient forces, and that was true from the
start.

Instead of the other method of fighting they are known for
(sacrificing inordinate amount of men for land) RU actually tried to
conserve forces this time, not sacrificing people for the eff of
it. This is new.
