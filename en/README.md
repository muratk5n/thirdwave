The electric grid loses 60% of the energy it carries FYI

Electrification falls short at nearly everything.. it cant form the
basis of a green infrastructure.

"Green fuel based solutions can help for cases where electrification

Most in the developed world discount the heating issue; for many it is
'just there'; it works, out sight out of mind. But this is the \#1

modern-day mainland United States. Yet when the need to develop a
national history with no discernible connection to Britain arose
during the Revolution, early Americans seized upon him"
