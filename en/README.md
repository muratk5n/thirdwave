This is a real problem with "AI" -the current reincarnation of neural
networks with gazillions of free parameters-.

Paper: "We surmise silent bugs are especially insidious in [deep
learning] libraries and applications built on top of them. The primary
reason is that DL applications.. belong to the family of 'non-testable
program', for which, strictly speaking, oracles do not
exist. Moreover, finding such bugs in DL libraries can be very hard
and tedious. A DL model developed by a user typically consists of many
floating point parameters and operations (up to billions). Even with a
few bugs, the model may still be created, trained, and appeared to
work...  While there are various explanations for an unexpected
behaviour that need to be ruled out, the worst is the fact that the
faulty computation is not explicitly developed by the user, but
implicitly produced by the library. However, little information can be
obtained from the DL model’s internal mechanism and training/inference
due to the 'black-box' and stochastic nature of DL
training/inference. Hence, any bugs in DL libraries may lead to bugs
in the user’s program that the user might not, easily, become aware
of"

Reuters: "Germany's Gascade, Ontras and terranets have agreed to
convert high-pressure gas pipelines to transport low-carbon hydrogen
from the Baltic Sea all the way the south of the country by 2025, the
companies said on Thursday... The plan, dubbed "Flow - making hydrogen
happen" aims to convert existing high-pressure gas pipelines with
feed-in capacity of up to 20 gigawatt (GW), offering the equivalent of
the power capacity of 20 nuclear plants"

HTGR nuclear plants (see Japan, RU) don't have to be near the sea;
they are helium cooled. 

New Statesman: "If key financial investors don’t take up the remaining
60 per cent of construction costs, the planned Sizewell C [nuclear]
plant in Suffolk is going nowhere. The omens aren’t good. Recently Sir
Nigel Wilson, group CEO of Legal & General, one of the UK’s largest
real assets firms, told BBC Radio Four: 'We are not big fans of
Sizewell C.'.. King, the UK’s former chief scientific adviser and a
long-standing nuclear supporter, told LBC that the plant would be
'very difficult to protect from flooding' due to rising sea levels on
the Suffolk coast"

The adventures, horrors depicted in some movies are a throwback to an
era when the nature dwarfed humans. Not the case anymore. The giant 30
meter whale would be conceptually more terrifying when humanity didn't
have 300+ meter 100K ton aircraft carrier.

An entire sea is disappearing. Modern world can do that now. 

"Formerly the fourth largest lake in the world with an area of 68,000
km2 (26,300 sq mi), the Aral Sea began shrinking in the 1960s after
the rivers that fed it were diverted by Soviet irrigation projects"
