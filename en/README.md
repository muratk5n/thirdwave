H2 View: "[With a new] process.. methane pyrolysis is used to produce
hydrogen. The input is methane (or natural gas)... Rather than CO2,
the process creates carbon black as a by-product. Unlike CO2, carbon
black is a solid product and hence easy to capture and use or
sequester. Carbon black in turn is used to produce the rubber for
tires amongst other applications, giving it resale value rather than
being a pure waste product"

AU federal election is near. Current gov did some good on H2 econ.

PAK army is too involved in civilian politics. They "talk too much". I
remember it like yesterday Asia Minor right-wing fascist coup leader
Evren and theirs Zia ul-Haq shaking hands smiling to the cameras and
calling eachother brothers. Overly meddling mil types need to get a
soda and a smile and shut the phuck up. Go to your barracks asshole

The parliament choice on its own is democratic can't deny that. If IK
uses the event to mobilize supporters and come back stronger, great.

"Shehbaz Sharif elected as Pakistanâ€™s new prime minister.. Election by
parliament comes after.. Imran Khan.. lost a vote of no confidence"

"Stranger things have happened". Nope.. I don't think so..

That guy almost became Labor Secretary BTW

Covid and high home prices likely the cause. Rates have been too low for too long..

"[T]here are 11.2 million RV-owning households in the U.S., an

"Canada bans foreign homebuyers for two years in effort to cool
market.. Government under pressure after prices climbed by more than
20% last year, while rental rates have also been rising"

Around 2008 the speculation on real-estate was so excessive, I once
heard a real-estate reference on a military show, *The Unit*
(2006-2009). A housewife was talking about "flipping" houses, and was
actively involved in the market.. This was a show about the life of
government employees BTW.

Inner/outer bickering is not a mere extension of a "post-WWII order".
China was on the winning side then (notice the seat at the UNSC), but
they are now the competition. After the fall of the Berlin Wall Russia
transitioned into free markets, democracy, yet they still had NATO
crawling up their ass. No the reason for the animosity is beyond the
so-called spread of freedom. Russia could be a bastion of democracy
tomorrow, they would still not be accepted as an ally.

The Times: "Finland and Sweden set to join Nato as soon as summer"

Al Jazeera: "Russia says it struck S-300 systems given to Ukraine by EU state"
