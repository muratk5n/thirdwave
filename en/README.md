Reuters: "Rolls-Royce successfully tests hydrogen-powered jet engine..
Britain's Rolls-Royce (RR.L) said it has successfully run an aircraft
engine on hydrogen, a world aviation first that marks a major step
towards proving the gas could be key to decarbonising air travel. The
ground test, using a converted Rolls-Royce AE 2100-A regional aircraft
engine, used green hydrogen created by wind and tidal power, the
British company said on Monday. Rolls and its testing programme
partner easyJet are seeking to prove that hydrogen can safely and
efficiently deliver power for civil aero engines"

Even the bitch car site admits this is big news.

That looks massive. Is there anything CSP folks can learn from? They
structured the whole thing differently, basically an entire building
became a reflector.

3K Celcius is a good chunk of energy to generate clean fuel.

Wiki: "The solar furnace of Uzbekistan was built in 1981, and is
located 45 kilometers away from Tashkent city. The furnace is the
largest in Asia. It uses a curved mirror, or an array of mirrors,
acting as a parabolic reflector, which can reach temperatures of up to
3,000 degrees Celsius.  The place for the solar furnace of Uzbekistan
was chosen carefully, because the sun shines there for 270 days a
year"

BEVs = bloated weight/cost

H2 Fuel Cells = less cost to mass. Anyone reading industry news knows
batteries are losing perceived advantages to fuel cell based EVs from
trucks to ships to rail and yes passenger cars"

TFI Global: "Belgium, a NATO member and a European ally, has blocked
the UK’s AUKUS pact. Despite the fact that both Belgium and the UK are
NATO members, a dispute has developed between the two nations over the

Animated film *Superman: The Red Son*, also known as "the Soviet
Superman", not bad for an anime... There's some (US) propaganda but
not excessive. A good story overall. They had him speaking with a
Russian accent that was amusing.
