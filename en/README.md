H2 View: "In a significant moment for the hydrogen economy, JERA and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) have been given the green light to
carry out a project that aims to develop an ammonia single-fuel burner
suitable for coal-fired boilers [for co-firing with at least 50%
ammonia]"

Li battery tech is shockingly bad for the needs of a green
future. Lithium reserves are limited, can only handle 5% of world
storage needs. Fast charging on par with chemically refueling is a
pipe dream, the best they can do is half an hour, which, when applied
degrades the battery increasing the chance of a blowup (when these
f-ing thing burn BTW, fire fighters cannot put it out with regular
methods). Batteries degrade even with regular charging (see below)
after 3500 cycles they go down to 70% capacity (imagine the effects of
that on a second-hand market for BEVs). Batteries are heavy,
impractical for transportation of energy.  Batteries rely on
rare-earth materials, for which we need to destroy Chile, Bolivia to
get. From a systemic, TCO viewpoint this tech is a complete junk.

GKN H2: "Our state-of-the-art metal hydride storage has been developed
and refined over the last 8+ years.. The standard metals we are using
are 100% recyclable.. The low-temperature metal hydride storage system
operates at the same pressure level as electrolysis and fuel cells..
The metal hydrides can last for decades without any losses. (99%
capacity after 3,500 cycles vs. 70% after 2000 cycles with Li
batteries)"

QFS tech can carry 803 kg at 248 bars in one trailer. H2 is 20 kg/m3
at 300 bars, 33.6 kWh/kg and avg household consumption of elec being
893 kWh per month,

Avg household consumption of elec is 893 kWh per month.

```python
eng = 10 * 33.6 * 803.0
print (eng, 'KWh')
print (int(eng / 894), 'homes')
```

```text
269808.0 KWh
301 homes
```

10 of those trucks can deliver enough energy for 300 homes for a month.

"Duterte wants unvaccinated jailed as COVID rate hits record high"

Sweet. Major planning there with the food.. 

CNBC: "[An] American couple saw the pandemic as an opportunity to
embark on a 3,149-mile hike along the Continental Divide Trail, which
stretches across the United States between the borders of Mexico and
Canada... To ensure they had an adequate supply of food, Miller and
Beissinger dehydrated 100 homemade dinners and mailed them out to the
various towns they planned to pass on their hike"

Employees already forgo some of their freedoms when they join a
company.. A company can require its employees to be present at certain
locations for example as its execs see fit. But then, if everyone at
those locations are not vaccinated, the company could be creating a
health risk for its employees -- a risk which they might not be
willing to take. So it should be within their rights to require all
employees to be vaccinated.

They could create some bizarre convoluted scheme of course, one for
employees with vax, one without vax, but that's just too much of a
pain in the ass. Easier to say "just get the f-ing vax".

It should be within their rights to do so

If you do single-payer, have to do it at scale, the bigger the better,
so California scale would be a good place to do it. If they pull it off,
hopefully it will spread to the rest of the country. 

LA Times: "California would enact a sweeping, first-in-the-nation
universal healthcare plan under a proposal unveiled Thursday by a
group of state Democratic lawmakers, providing health services to
every resident and financed by a broad array of new taxes on
individuals and businesses... The proposal, now laid out in separate
pieces of legislation, faces significant hurdles in the coming
months.. ‚ÄúThere are countless studies that tell us a single-payer
healthcare system is the fiscally sound thing to do, the smarter
healthcare policy to follow, and a moral imperative if we care about
human life,‚Äù Assemblyman Ash Kalra (D-San Jose), the proposal‚Äôs
author, said Thursday"

Yann is so full of shit. With his approach, deep neural networks what
came to be called "AI" today, that is *exactly* what they are
doing. If not in the tiniest detail, certainly in spirit, in the
overall approach to the problem. Implicitly they believe what's known
about the human brain so far is final, X number of neurons are there,
they connect and do stuff somehow, so if we start from these tiny
particles (neurons) and build up in software, we will reach human
level intelligence. This is the belief, yet no cigar. A decade ago
they could be forgiven bcz the hardware "wasn't there yet". Now it
is. Where is Artif. General Intelligence?

NN Expert Yann LeCun: "The cargo cult approach to aeronautics‚Äîfor
actually building airplanes‚Äîwould be to copy birds very, very closely;
feathers, flapping wings, and all the rest. And people did this back
in the 19th century, but with very limited success... The equivalent
in AI is to try to copy every detail that we know of about how neurons
and synapses work, and then turn on a gigantic simulation of a large
neural network inside a supercomputer, and hope that AI will
emerge. That‚Äôs cargo cult AI"

JFK is claimed by the "Irish" as one of their own, but his kinship,
and comparisons to him should be on the grounds of "young and bad
Presidents" rather than an "Irish" President. And as a young and a bad
President he is more like a Bill Clinton, or George W. Bush.

Feynman apparently ignored most of the film, looked at two frames
only, before and right after the event. Eliminating noise, focusing on
the essential.. key.

---

There is footage (the so-called Zapruder film) w jfk moving in ways
suggesting someone shot from the front (Oswald shot from behind), but
that theory has been debunked. They showed the reel to Feynman he
concluded the shot came from Oswald's direction. He knew a thing or
two abt physics right, action-reaction etc.

Yes some reports talk about a second wave of protests which were
probably fueled by the sitting Prez trying to use the protests against
another faction (the previous President).

NYT: "The [Kazakh] crisis coincided with a power struggle within the
government, fueling talk that the people fighting in the streets were
proxies for feuding factions of the political elite. There is also
feverish speculation about Kremlin meddling and a host of other murky
possible causes"

After Rome invaded Gaul, today's France, did the natives people
change? Did they become Italian-like? I dont think so.. no more than
they already are similar due to being around the same region. I
remember one Julius Ceasar observation of the Celts [parahr] "Celt men
are given to frequent displays of bravery".  Isn't that how natives
are still like are over there though? Look at that Spiderman guy
climbing high-rise buildings, or the rope walker P. Petit.

They mixed Catholicism and Vodoo, so it's like Vodoo
Christianity.. Shows many things can mix with many other things, and

The Guardian: "Far from B-movie cliches, vodou is spiritual system and
a way of life.. Haiti, the saying goes, is ‚Äú70% Catholic, 30%
Protestant, and 100% Vodou‚Äù. Vodou is everywhere in the Caribbean
nation, a spiritual system infusing everything from medicine and
agriculture to cosmology and art"
