Gasworld: "FortisBC Energy, Suncor Energy and Hazer Group unveiled
plans for a pilot project at Suncor’s Burrard Terminal site that will
use methane pyrolysis technology to produce hydrogen while storing the
carbon by-product as solid synthetic graphite..

The technology set to be deployed at the Canadian site will be
provided Australia’s Hazer Group and will generate approximately
300,000 gigajoules of clean-burning gas energy that can replace the
equivalent annual natural gas usage of approximately 3,300
B.C. households"

H2 View: "bp, BOC study results set to accelerate hydrogen uptake in
UK road freight.. the joint study found distributing hydrogen as a
compressed gas via road trailer is the best option to stimulate the UK
market to take up hydrogen fuel for heavy-duty transport over the
mid-term..

The companies say the nine-month study has provided important insights
into requirements and options for hydrogen distribution, station
design, and dispensing costs for heavy-duty applications.

In the long-term, the study anticipates that both gaseous and liquid
hydrogen will have a role to play in fuelling the sector"

mushroom packaging.. Magical Mushroom Company, a UK-based firm, mixes
agricultural waste with the ‘root structure of a mushroom’ in order to

single-use or disposably plastic which never breaks down completely –
on our oceans, our soil and our environment are well known"

The Boston Globe: "Two-plus years into the pandemic, many companies
are anxious to get back to in-person work, but find their workers like
hybrid life just fine. There’s a new turf war shaping up at work:
managers who want everyone back in the “real” office vs. employees who
prefer the one at home. And that standoff is leading to some
irreconcilable conflicts"

Al Monitor: "Lapid will go head-to-head against former Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu from the position of prime minister. Lapid will
lead the center-left bloc, while Netanyahu will lead the
rightwing-ultra-Orthodox bloc, with each trying to win the 61 seats
needed to form a coalition. That is why Lapid is targeting all the
Arab parties as partners in his efforts, and not just coalition
partner Ra’am... Lapid even sees the opposition Arab Joint List as a
potential partner. In a television interview this week, Lapid said,
'There hasn’t been an Arab party in the government for the past 74
years. We’re in the process of changing that now.'"

But hey these days bushels of wheat is becoming more valueable, so
maybe soon 20 bushels will buy one iPhone.. Brighter days might be
lying ahead for the wheat country.

If country wants to fix the value of its currency, need to produce
goods, services foreigners are willing to buy, and stop printing
money, handing it to people that will be inflationary.. If all a
country has is bushels of wheat, $10 per bushel 50 of that will buy 1
iPhone, no way around that. Can price the bushel domestically to be 1
punk sterling that don't matter, then country's exchange rate is 1
dollar = 10 punk sterlings.

Looks like US is stalling as much as Iran. \#JCPOA Does this have to
with the fact that all functioning nuke weapon products are ultimately
tied to the original US research, and since noone will give Iran that
res, govs are not afraid of an Iranian nuke? What if the make dirty
bombs with the uranium they have? Not an issue?
