All things considered, has the US been a "force for good" in the
world?

The report card is spotty. Just the other day I read about "Sam the
Banana Man" Zemurray, a US businessman, when his banana business was
threatened in Honduras, he personally organized a coup, created a
small civilian army put them on a ship sent them over to Honduras to
fight the government, contributed to the overthrow of a democratically
elected president (USG mostly stood by and in the end helped
him). That's not all, the newly installed president **paid him** for
the trouble using Honduras' taxpayer money. How is that for money well
spent?
