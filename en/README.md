dogpaddling as hard as it can toward early 4chan but probably isn't
going to make it, people are making blogs again, and everyone wants to
talk to the ELIZA

Is the whole internet swimming back home to spawn and die, what is
happening"

transition needs to advance, fusion or no fusion.

Good analysis here of the internal ramifications of the Associated

Bloomberg: "[Max Reyes] Over the last year have had more events than
FTX. We've had the blow up of the Tera Luna ecosystem that led to the
collapse of Three Arrows Capital, the collapse of Celsius. With the
exposure to crypto, Silvergate, other companies with names like Micro
Strategy that just hold coins on the balance sheet have taken a
beating over the last year because of the anxiety. The blowup of FTX
accelerated and worsened the impact"
