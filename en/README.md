Jane's Defence: "Indian Air Force (IAF) combat jets have been
scrambled several times in the last few weeks in the country's
northeastern borders in response to growing tensions with China, a
defence source confirmed"

Why the rise? The "shitshow" in Libya opened the floodgates (Kaddafi
died 2011), about the same time Syrian civil war started, later we saw
the rise of IS, jihadi mofos everywhere went rabid, some in Africa no
doubt.

I checked GTD (all incidents, all deaths, monthly, ends 2020-06),
there is a spike. I'd call the increases significant. Since 2016
numbers went down now they are lower.

The article seems to downplay the rise of terror attacks in Africa btw
2012-2016, according to GTD counts went "from 114 attacks and 1,944
fatalities in 2006, to 2,051 attacks and 13,182 fatalities in 2016".

I really wanted Russia part of this clean fuel transition; before the
war Putin told the visiting Italian businessman on clean ammonia that
RU could be number one exporter of the stuff; then everything went to
shit. Pity.

TFI Global: "Greece played absolutely smart throughout the Ukraine
war, and now it’s richer than ever.. Greek shipping companies have
devised a smart plan to evade European sanctions. From the Russian
port of Kavkaz which lies on the north of the Black Sea, Greek ships
have loaded oil from the Russian ships. The move effectively
camouflaged Russian oil. Greece ships were also engaged in
ship-to-ship transfers. Greece has earned billions of dollars of
revenue from this exercise"

H2 View: "Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) signed a framework

That would be salt-cavern I assume; apparently the area is rich with
such formations

The Guardian: "The energy company SSE has begun work to develop an
underground cavern in east Yorkshire to store hydrogen, aiming to
stockpile the renewable source of power for when the freezing,
windless conditions experienced in the last week occur in future.

The project will produce hydrogen using renewable energy in a
35-megawatt electrolyser which will be stored in a cavern the size of
St Paul’s Cathedral located a mile deep at an existing SSE site in
Aldbrough on the Yorkshire coast"

Most of the Snyderverse actors were great picks; Momoa, Cavill; maybe
they'll be back in some form some day - JM wants to be a bad guy?
Cavill too, a future, or different version of the character..  DC has
massive cannon, creates options.

Chemistry World: "A combined desalination–electrolysis system that can
produce green hydrogen directly from seawater has been developed by a
team in China...  Following successful laboratory trials, the team
were keen to demonstrate the practicality of this approach at scale
and installed a demo device in Shenzhen Bay. The compact unit ran for
an initial test period of 133 days producing over a million litres of
hydrogen without any evident corrosion of the catalyst or increase in
impurities"
