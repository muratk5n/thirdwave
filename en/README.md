LCOH for salt caverns and LRC are very good (same doc)

---

H2 underground storage using salt cav., LRC, and pipes have capital
cost 35, 51, 386 dollars/KW respectively. That's just crazy
(cheap).

Same paper

"One spherical or cylindrical receiver is used to heat HTF to the
levels needed for the [thermochemical water splitting cycle]... The
optical efficiency of the ASC is high and reaches 91% in practice,
while it is 100% theoretically like the parabolic dish. Since the wind
flows through its conical rings, the wind load of the ASC is about 10%
that of the parabolic dish of the same dimensions"

---

Beam-down is interesting bcz can reach high temperatures easily, and
at that temperature, water can be split just by sheer heat energy, no
need for electricity.

---

"[2021] Recently, Al-Maaitah.. has developed a high flux solar
concentrator with a lower focal point fixed to the ground composed of
nested conical reflective rings resulting in high solar concentrations
and temperatures well above 1,000 C. Since the focal point is fixed on
the ground, then the high-temperature and high-pressure HTF can easily
be conveyed through solid inexpensive pipes to the storage tank
sitting at the ground underneath the receiver or next to it. A 10 m in
diameter concentrator was built and tested in Masdar Institute Solar
Platform in Abu Dhabi (UAE) where temperatures exceeding 1,000 C have
been reached at the fixed focal point even at low DNI"

What is the latest on this tech..? Can it be scaled?

Solar beam-down hardware in UAE - looks scifi

Focusing solar through lenses seem to be somewhat unexplored.

---

For CSP, thermal storage is completely unnecessary in a H2, NH3
generation scenario, bcz renewable fuel itself is a form of backup.

---

That's like saying filling up, and emptying the gas tank degrades the
tank, and after a few thousand fills you can't use half of it.

That ain't  technology - it's a joke.

---

Cycling through bats degrade it? And eventually it's dead. Sad

OMG, cold survival camping! Watched a vid on someone's 'survival'
experience.. It's not exactly roughing it.. I ask; what was the
heating mechanism?  2 KW heater, **and** 3.5 inches (~9 cm) of
styrafoam insulation on the walls, floor and ceiling. That's how u
survive -29C.

1 barrel of oil has 1700 kWh of energy, 7000x1700/(24x1e6) is 500
MW. Half a nuclear plant, and something solar can match, easily.  If
H2 is generated on-site from that crude and clean fuel is shipped as
export, fine.

Oil Review Africa: "Eni, Sonatrach announce oil and gas discovery in
Berkine North Basin in the Algerian desert. Early estimates place the
size of the find at around 140 million barrels of oil... During the
production test, the well delivered 7000 barrels of oil per day"

Indonesia is huge. Covers a lot of land and sea area. They have a half

The Douche and Douchess, failing at PR. Not their fault, the
institution is defunct IMO.. esp in a Brexit Britain, with less shine,
glitter it's harder to sell this lemon.

The Guardian: "It was supposed to be a visit to mark the Queen's
diamond jubilee - a chance to present the modern face of the British
monarchy to a region where republican sentiment is on the rise. But it
really didn't turn out that way.. the tour may have accelerated moves
to ditch the Queen as the head of state"

It's like, we will soon find out about that, won't we, Focker?

Remember the circle of trust ðŸ‘Œ

NYT: "[Peter Thiel interview, 2017] Itâ€™s like, even if you appointed a
whole series of conservative Supreme Court justices, Iâ€™m not sure that
Roe v. Wade would get overturned.. I donâ€™t know if people even care
about the Supreme Court"

Pakistan has great access; and the country is always in a state of
chaos. They want them in constant trouble, turned inward? One
wonders..

---

Apparently the waters until that island chain are shallow so any sub
sailing there would have its ass sticking out, waiting to get hit

---

At first u think 'ah China is doing fine, [look at](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FO3P7q7XsAkh0Wz?format=png&name=small)
all that access".

Then you zoom in and [boom](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FO3P-S2XoAUWn6o?format=png&name=small)!
Notice that island chain is lined up like a f-ing firing squad, with
Okinawa smack in the middle housing one of the largest US bases. No wonder
China wants Taiwan (at the end of that island chain) to break
through the encirclement.

---

Iraq, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE are in abysmal state (same map), for high
seas. Iraq's access to even *Persian Gulf* is terrible... No wonder
Saddam invaded Kuwait.

Saudi Arabia is an 'inner' country. They got'em locked in good, behind
Yemen, Oman, and UAE with a few tiny access points to the high seas,
which can be blocked with ease.

Gravitas Plus: The story of Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky

[[-]](https://youtu.be/Kn2TCq6R8Tw?t=244)

The attack was probably a message to JB while visiting RzeszÃ³w,
Poland, right across the border, very close to Lviv.

"Just when many thought Eastern Ukraine was the focus, there was the
Russian attack on a Western town, Lviv"

F24: "Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden calls Putin a 'butcher'"

My native country is an outer's outpost (in NATO). Been fine with this
alliance personally i.e. it is in homie interest to have a defense
against Russia. We fought these people for centuries; once RU army was
15 km near Stanpoli nearly took the city. It was through major diplom,
'alligianery' that all was saved. Keeping 'future naval powers' at bay
cld be in US citizens' interest too...

But, the system is fraying on the edges.. The alliance arrives with
crass ideology creating unrest leading to ultra-nationalist
movements. The pack leader US doesn't seem to be willing to fight all
the time, so in order to keep the inners "contained", chaos is
created, 'allowed' on the edges e.g. Iraq, Libya, Syria,
Ukraine... The spillover effect is toxic for all, especially the
outposts, one could argue, even for the seat of the empire itself.
