I like red - bypass electricity wherever possible

H2 Fuel News: "The following is how red, pink and purple nuclear
hydrogen are made.. Red hydrogen – This form is made by using the
high-temperature catalytic water electrolysis powered by a plant’s
thermal energy"

H2 View: "Oil major, bp is set to take a 40.5% stake in one of the
world’s largest renewables and green hydrogen energy hubs in Western
Australia, which could produce 1.6 million tonnes of green hydrogen
per year. bp has announced it has agreed to acquire a 40.5% equity
stake in and become the operator of the Asian Renewable Energy Hub
(AREH), in Pilbara, Western Australia from July 1, 2022"

---

H2 View: "Lhyfe and Chantiers de l’Atlantique have partnered to take
large-scale hydrogen production offshore, hoping to develop the
‘hydrogen fuel chain’ at sea and in ports"

---

H2 View: "Rotterdam ammonia terminal to be scaled to three million
tonnes per year"

---

H2 View: "Scottish towns and rural communities are the targets of a
new partnership which hopes to supply sustainable hydrogen gas for
domestic heating"

---

H2 View: "SoCalGas scores $750,000 grant for hydrogen from biogas
development project.. Grant from the California Energy Commission is
to help overcome cost and sustainability challenges"

Gas-fired plants with CCS generating electricity is relatively clean
but inefficient. Electricity as a transmission mechanism has problems;
it is slow, generation has to match demand, exactly, every time. That
causes power plants to unnecessarily ramp-up, ramp-down their
production, and/or complicated mechanisms to try to predict power
usage. Storing electricity is expensive, batteries are too heavy,
based on rare earth materials, and prone to catch fire.

An energy analyst (Bruce Robertson) says Western AU has no power
problems bcz they mandated cheap purchase of gas for power plants

"@MarkOgge

Understand that the 96% foreign-owned LNG gas export companies
currently making windfall profits from gouging Australian customers
for our own gas"

The problem likely is when your domestic resources become part of an
international supply/demand mechanism pricing problems can
ensue. You'd have the resources locally, but essentially be competing
against international customers to get at those resources. No wonder
some countries even nationalized the resource production capacity
outright.

Suspended? Daam

Renew Economy: "[Oz] Energy Market Operator has suspended the National
Electricity Market across all five participating states, saying the
market has become 'impossible' to operate because of the soaring cost
of fossil fuels and generators withholding their capacity from the
market... The extraordinary situation has been triggered by the
soaring cost of coal and gas. Generators who have to purchase coal on
the spot market"

---

Load shedding basically means there isn't enough supply so delivery is
cut (shed). Oz has vast natural resources though, they should be fine.

ABC AU: "In the electricity industry no two words instil a greater
sense of fear or failure as load shedding.. In order to avoid
circumstances where supply and demand become dangerously out of whack
the market operator can cut power to big numbers of customers to
restore balance — it sheds the load"

I wanna see a handshake. A big wide smile.. I wanna see f-ing Camelot
oozing outa that. Do it Biden

Al Monitor: "Biden gambles there's more to gain by courting
Saudis.. Making an about-face by visiting Saudi Arabia, US President
Joe Biden is betting he has more to gain than lose even as rights
activists accuse him of selling his soul to oil"

Al Jazeera: "The Gaza Strip had seven main border crossings giving it
access to the outside world. Only three remain open"

AMLO going after Lyin Ted for some reason - it's funny.

The spread of white collar work did not create smarter people who can
shoot the shit intelligently on any topic; it created parrots who
merely transmit talking points they hear on MSM; they only act
intelligently for show, to look cool by the watercooler, as if in an
episode of *The West Wing*. The Renaissance Man or Woman remains a
distant mirage, people are as stupid as ever. 

---

Need to reflect on the last great American thinker; Mark Twain and why
he was extremely negative on the virtues of the common man. US
founders built the Republic BTW not only against various branches of
power, balancing them against eachother, but also against the people
themselves for a reason.

---

Similar cultures modernize similarly; I look at the history of Greek
military coups I see a similar history to Asia Minor. Greece "the
birthplace of democracy" experienced numerous coups well into the end
of 20th century - the one in 1967 was the worst; it lasted until 1974,
their chief figure was a guy nicknamed "Greek Gaddafi". This guy
helped orchestrate the initial coup, did another coup while inside the
coup, and a seperate one all the way in Cyprus. Characters like that
were dime-a-dozen in homieland during the same era.

I wonder how many suckers lost money in that last bump thinking it was
time to buy the dip.

NYT: "Russia’s Oil Revenue Soars Despite Sanctions, Study Finds.. The
United States has made a dent in Russia’s earnings, banning all
Russian fossil fuel imports. Still, the United States is importing
refined oil products from countries like the Netherlands and India
that most likely contain Russian crude, a loophole for oil from Russia
to make its way to America"

The Independent: "Death sentences of British fighters in Ukraine a
warning to ‘soldiers of fortune’, Russia says"
