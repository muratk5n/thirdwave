NYT: "[A Sicilian town Floridia] is perhaps the most blisteringly hot
town in the recorded history of Europe, offering Italy and the entire
Mediterranean a preview of a sweltering and potentially uninhabitable
future brought on by the globe’s changing climate... [A] nearby
monitoring station registered a temperature of ... nearly 49 degrees
Celsius....  the unprecedented heat rendered Floridia a blindingly
bright ghost town, with its bars deserted, its baroque and
sand-colored churches darkened, its piazzas emptied.In the surrounding
fields, the area’s famed snails burned in their shells. The relentless
sun branded the verdello green lemons with yellow blots and stewed
their flesh within. Everyone holed up in their houses. The
air-conditioning they blasted prompted blackouts"

were on one side, had to be balanced by a big eq on the other side.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
