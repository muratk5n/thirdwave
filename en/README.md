Is *Dune* timely? I dont think so. It's desert mysticism, little
*Lawrence of Arabia*, little *Game of Thrones*.. but no. The time for
that has passed. Now it is time for *Foundation*.

A good actor can make a good script phenomenal. That is true. 

---

"If it ain't on the page, it ain't on the stage". Good saying. A great
actor cannot save a bad script, or bad directing. Movies are mostly
about the story, the camera angles, when to cut etc.

Therefore what we see as successful actors are not just good actors,
but know how to pick scripts (and directors). They have an eye for
it. Otherwise they'd be toast.  Appear in wrong movies a few times you
are done bcz great work is not just about acting, but the overall
production.

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
