Iâ€™m just remembering that my second year in America, someone asked me
to 'validate their parking,' which was my first time hearing the
phrase, and after blinking stupidly in silence for a full five seconds
I said 'Well parking is really hard but Iâ€™m sure you did it really
well'"

just looks so bad.. Imagine amount of copper, steel used in the
construction. A single gas pipeline can replace all of that, *and* perform better.

I see, there have been fluidic space theories, trying to explain
gravity, one including dark matter, dark energy..  Good stuff..

An air bubble in water rises up to surface.. There is more pressure at
the bottom of it than at the top. More pres at the bottom bcz more
fluid there relative to top, more weight, creating pressure
difference.

If space is seen as fluidic, planet gravitational pull can be
explained similarly perhaps?  This fluid is extremely dense (according
to a yet unknown measure), denser further from bodies, and relative to
that planet bodies are like air, so "bubbles", ie other bodies are
pushed towards it, explaining the pull..? ðŸ¤”

Using coffee beans ground into a fine powder, then boiled in a little
[brass pot](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FB9mjc0XMAU_YNS?format=jpg&name=small)
is called different names by countries, with many laying claim on its
invention. But that style of coffee making was first invented in Yemen; so it
should be called Yemenese coffee.

That actually looked funny \#Lenox \#KO
