Osprey aircraft uses tiltrotor tech, very unstable. In recent scifi we
start seeing more and more quadcopter like aircraft, but these are
unstable constructions. Forward thrust, glide are more stable, or
helicopter tech. It takes extreme amt of processing to keep a
quadcopter aloft, as every hobbyst knows.

Once again, tech looks shiny, but not robust.

Remember RR, this is the guy who waved a gun around on the big screen
for a living, then he was *shot* by a real gun, in real life. Also the
founder of modern conservatism.. I think he knew what he was talking
about.

"But guns are a natural con issue". ?? Ronald Reagan was for gun

The rules of the culture war is that it is fought on moral, or stupid,
and usually deadlocked issues where there isn't much movement either
way. That works great, bcz then each side can jump up and down, and
galvanize "their base" wout causing much change, eg guns issue (until
it became seriously serious).. Or the climate.

haven‚Äôt been trumpeting the Supreme Court‚Äôs decision to allow a Texas
ban on abortions to go forward"

Never liked that general area, downtown.. Must have been the the overt
finance-vibe.
