Electricity tech pretty much sucks at everything except in certain
end-products which shaped the experience of an entire generation of
white-collor folk. They see lights go blink-blink and they get all
excited, and want to use that thing that makes things go blink-blink
for everything.. This is unrealistic.

Electricity based heating is incredibly inefficient (surprise).

If green heating takes priority two things need to happen; 1) encourage
production of small, portable, H2/NH3 heating units, provided cheaply to
the world (otherwise they'll just burn wood, coal). Lavo was
[already working](https://revolution-green.com/unsw-develop-hydrogen-storage-renewables/)
on such a tech to power ovens (using a heat-exchange chemical reaction
wout creating a flame) with simple H2 canisters. 2) For home
heating, massive H2 pipeline infra needs to be built which can provide homes
the fuel, they can use that for heating, through CHP.

Fortescue is from AU which has plenty of renewable potential of its
own. Then why go to Jordan..? These guys must be thinking four steps
ahead.. When the whole world wakes up to the potential of this stuff,
everyone will try to grab opportunities from sunny countries; well
Fortesque is in there now, locking in commitments... Europeans are in
North Africa. Saudi Arabia is already working with Japan.

"Jordanian government officials have met with a delegation from
Fortescue Metals Group to discuss investment opportunities in green
hydrogen and ammonia"

Actually it was the academia that discovered GPUs could be used for
common numerical computation. First algorithm to run faster on the GPU
was researched [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220782520_LU-GPU_Efficient_Algorithms_for_Solving_Dense_Linear_Systems_on_Graphics_Hardware).

"GPU coding happened thanks to the company NVidia"

Jon Stew new show is all serious.. During interviews I keep waiting
for that bizarre turn, like, 'you say there is no money for this
bill, but have you ever tried to put panties on your head?', and the
guy giving this blank look.. Yet the moment never arrives..

Chappelle, closed the deal üëç

"Ramped-up domestic production of green hydrogen and ammonia makes
perfect sense for South Korea. Last month a deal was signed between
Australia-based Origin Energy and steelmaker POSCO for the supply of
green hydrogen in the form of green ammonia, produced at Origin‚Äôs
to-be-developed, hydro-powered ammonia production facility in Bell
Bay, Tasmania. Although POSCO is aiming for the import of zero-carbon
feedstock to be only temporary, the sheer scale of their goal to
produce 5 million tonnes of clean hydrogen in South Korea by 2050 is
readily apparent"
