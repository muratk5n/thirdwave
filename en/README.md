"[2020] POSCO Energy, South Korea‚Äôs largest private energy producer,
completed the world‚Äôs largest fuel cell manufacturing plant in
2015..

South Korea‚Äôs priorities are leadership in fuel cell cars and large
scale stationary fuel cells for power generation. According to the
‚ÄúHydrogen Economy Roadmap of Korea‚Äù, the government aims to reach the
production of 6.2 million FCEVs by 2040 with 2.9 million units for the
domestic market and 3.3 million for export. The target for fuel cell
power generation is 15 gigawatts (GW) by 2040, including 7 GW for
export. The roadmap also sets a target for stationary fuel cell‚Äôs
application in buildings (2.1 GW by 2040)...

[South Korea's] biggest car manufacturer Hyundai is betting big on
H2. According to its FCEV Vision 2030.. the company plans to expand
its fuel cell production capacity to 700,000 units per year by 2030"

That. Is. Wild.. Surely ID is good tech but if one rocket gets
through, can make major damage. That is one high-value target.

The Times of Israel: "Israel said preparing to defend new Karish gas
rig from Hezbollah attack.. According to Kan, Navy using vessels
including submarines to protect drilling site; Iron Dome battery to be
placed nearby as well"

I guess the rigs fall under the range of Hezbollah rockets.

"Lebanese Hezbollah yesterday warned that it would not accept Israel
to work in the Karish gas field in the disputed maritime zone.. This
came following the arrival of the Greek floating production and
storage rig, Energean, to the area"

Equivalent to 600 mil boe.

"The Karish and Tanin gas fields [natural gas reservoir located off
the coast of Israel] together are estimated to hold 2‚Äì3 trillion cubic
feet of gas"

Click "Output" for map. Added new fields I hear about to a seperate

AL on Einstein: He did theorize wout checking much with real data but

I read one kid saved himself during a shooting by playing dead. Forget
fortifying schools, arming teachers; learn to play dead. That is the
key skill.

Catchy. That'll do the trick.. Gun problem fixed.

U-oh.. Theory made the calculation assuming there was a Big Bang and
cosmic microwave background is real.. Maybe there wasn't a Big Bang
and the oft-quoted CMB isn't real. It was water reflection

Al Jazeera: "The Israeli government has failed to pass a bill that
would renew and uphold the legal status of illegal Israeli settlers in
the occupied West Bank.. The failure to renew the bill on Monday
highlighted the separate legal systems in the occupied West Bank,
where nearly 500,000 Israeli settlers enjoy the benefits of Israeli
citizenship and law while some 3 million Palestinians live under
military rule that is now well into its sixth decade...

Some 500,000 Israeli settlers live in more than 120 settlements and
outposts across the occupied West Bank that are considered illegal
under international law. The settlements, which are fortified,
Jewish-only housing complexes, are continuing to expand in the
occupied West Bank as well as occupied East Jerusalem. They are seen
as a major obstacle to any potential deal with Israel..

Attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians and their property
are common. Settlers are usually backed by armed Israeli forces when
committing such attacks"
