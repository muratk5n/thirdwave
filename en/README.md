Not bad.. 

BBC: "[Newly elected Japanese PM Kishida] promised to spend billions
of dollars to help the world's third-biggest economy recover from
Covid restrictions.

Unlike another rival .. he has been more critical of the economic
policy of former prime minister Shinzo Abe, known as Abenomics, saying
that only the rich got richer.

With China also high on the agenda for the leadership election, Mr
Kishida has accused Beijing of wanting to export 'its authoritarian
system'"

Right needs to act right, left needs to act left. Else there are
gaping holes in the pol palette others will fill (as Nazis did in
Germany). Post-ideology, TINA world is over. We are now in a
post-post-ideology world.

Need to be careful with overt anti-politician anti-electoral politics
types.. If politics is delegitimized, what are you left with? With the
other source of power: Money. .
