The Novax incident happened while Australia was (is) trying to open
up. The curt denial probably helped to look tough on virus while still
continuing to open - could have been done partly for that
reason. Novax will be fine.. At that level of fame whether they like
it or not, they are part of politics.

Plus we are talking about f-ing tennis, it's not it is football. Who
cares? My third least favorite sport (first being golf).

Such colorful speeches though.. I'd be impressed if the speechmakers
weren't so full of shit.

By its foundation the check on power in US was achieved by having
*seperate* branches balancing eachother, not requiring supermajority
*within* each branch. Appeals to history, customs in this regard have
no basis. SCOTUS works on simple majority. Congress passes laws same
way. President is the singular decision maker within his branch (not
even a minority there). The founders could surely arrange some stuff
to require supermajorities within each branch if they thought that was
important.

---

Simple majority should matter. It already does for pres elections for
instance. An handful more votes in a single key state can make one
President.

If it's good for one branch of gov, why not for another?

Vox: "The filibuster has been around, in some version or another, since
the mid-1800s. But it's never been used as constantly as it is today...

'We have added a new veto point in American politics,' Gregory Koger,
the author of "Filibustering: A Political History of Obstruction in
the House and Senate," says. 'It used to be the House, the Senate, and
the President, and now it‚Äôs the House, the President, the Senate
majority, and the Senate minority.'"

As Bitcoin's energy footprint grows, Democrats are raising climate
change and grid concerns in their attempts to rein in digital assets

Scrutiny from lawmakers is triggering lobbying on behalf of crypto
miners who are using an escalating amount of computing and electricity
to extract valuable digital tokens from the blockchain.

"It is time for Congress and federal regulators to step up and address
the serious risks that crypto poses to our economy and our
environment," @SenWarren said in a statement to Politico"

When you say "it's fake" they get upset bcz it sounds like u r calling
all of the physical exertion involed as fake. That's clearly not the
case. The acts are physical, ppl can get hurt, it just ain't combat,
or even sparring in a competitive way.. It's like shadow boxing, with
two people.

---

I guess it is, the way figure iceskating, gymnastics is a
sport.. There is the aesthetics part, there is the sports part.. It
just isn't a one-on-one competition of course (the winners are known
beforehand, no?). No wonder a few of its practitioners made it in
Holywood.. Ventura, Dwayne J, Cena...

American wrestling? Is that sport? :)

Batteries are too heavy, the train would not move (or catch fire and blow up)

---

As it stands CA railway project is a disaster, will have eaten up over
$100 billion, and as of now it hasn't transported a single passenger.

Buying up land in the path of the project apparenlty cost some delays,
but overall mismanagement was worse, and the choice of going electric
is a major part of that / its symptom. It points to a pervasive
foolishness when it comes to deciding on green tech. Store green fuel
in one car of the train, enough to propel the whole train for an
entire SF/LA trip. No need for electrified lines, simpler design.

AP [2021]: "At the center of the latest [CA high-speed rail
construction] dispute is how soon to electrify the line, which rail
officials say is a necessity to make the train high speed ‚Äî the whole
idea of the project that voters were sold on. They want to enter into
a contract next year for a firm to design and construct an electrified
track and system and to maintain it for 30 years, effectively locking
in the state for the long haul"

An anti-corrosive substance was not added to the water, the lead in
pipes corroded. They switched back to better source of water in 2015.
It was a perfect storm; dirty water, faulty water treatment, lead
in pipes (which is not uncommon btw).

The main culprit was running out of money, and switching to dirty
water source.

---

Why the water problems? Flint MI went broke, had lots of unfunded
pension costs. They started cutting services, switching to water from
Flint river was one solution. But the river water is nasty, ppl
developed health problems. The river is actualy is so dirty once it
[caught fire](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flint-water-crisis-everything-you-need-know).

Current talks on Flint, MI are about who needs to get the blame for
its previous water woes.. There are no more water problems there AFAIK.

"If you work in AI you are most likely collecting data, cleaning

bandwagon. I liked the magical world AI promised and I‚Äôve found a

Yeaa there was no danger of that.. Reps were toast, thanks to W's
dismal approval.

"But the invasion could be a gamble in the case of a McCain Presidency"

He didn't really roll the dice for 2008 Georgia invasion; W approval
was in the shitter, end of term - on the way out. Iraq invasion
aftermath was looking grim. And on top, financial crisis, recession
was starting.. In this env W promises NATO membership to Georgia and
Ukraine and boom! Georgia invasion. Puten scored on when US was down,
calculated a response would not be forthcoming. It worked.
