Woke has history.. Post 9/11 there was Jack Bauer, James Blonde,
Bourne beating up on 'terrorists'.. After Iraq mishaps, crisis, there
was partial return to normality, some backlash, minor Woke - not too
bad. It was after Trump ppl really went batshit, 'oh no it aint over'
kind of realization set it, then we had mega backlash, mega
Woke. Recent commentary here have mostly been on this last phase.
We are in it, sadly.

It's stange how rough, "public" perception works.. Escalating the war
in Vietnam, Agent Prange, general war-mongering behaviour is
associated with Nixon, piece, decisive action, the moon landing with
Kennedy. Yet these events, their originators are completely the other
way around. Nixon ended the war in Vietnam, landed a man on the Moon,
made gutsy calls at home and abroad. Kennedy.. made that one speech on
the Moon, "we go to the Moon because I'm haahd". 🤨

and price stability risks in the West, you could also believe in
unicorns"

Pozsar: "The commodities market is much more financialized and
leveraged today than it was during the 1973 OPEC supply crisis, and
today’s Russian supply crisis is much bigger, much more broad -based,
and much more correlated. It’s scarier"

By CC he means individual comm prices are going up and down in
sync. 

Pozsar: "Commodity correlations are also at 1, which, to stress, is
never a good thing. But that’s precisely what happens when the West
sanctions the single -largest commodity producer of the world, which
sells virtually everything"

I wonder if Russkies left that big fat USD cash so they would be
seized, giving them excuse to demand rouble for gas. 

Pozsar: "Bretton Woods II was built on inside money [as in
