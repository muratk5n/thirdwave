"Seaborg Technologies.. is working ...  to develop a molten salt
thermal energy storage technology that can store large amounts of
intermittent wind and solar power... 'Normally no chemist in their
right mind would look at anything as corrosive as sodium hydroxide,
Seaborg CEO, Troels SchÃ¶nfeldt, told pv magazine. 'However, in the
development of our reactor, we needed to use sodium hydroxide and were
forced to develop these methods.'..

Sodium hydroxide can be produced at low cost from seawater as a
byproduct from chlorine production. Seaborg said this is six times
cheaper that standard salts used for storage"

"Events, constructions sites and off-grid infrastructure could soon run
on quiet, clean power...The EVERYWH2ERE project, funded by the FCH JU,

At the height of US's logistic support campaign to Britain during
WWII, it was building one cargo ship a week, these so-called Liberty
ships, which were these monstreous constructions, quickly put together
but they did the job, carried necessary cargo to Britain. US could do
that for it had the know-how, could creatively speed up a major
industrial process. *That* is power.

Military is a function of a country's underlying economy, and the
economy is a function of its inherent diversity. If a country is
producing nuts and bolts it can put them together for a weapon during
the time of war. If one is producing only bolts, they can't build
shit.. This is why Beckley's power measure is ingenious; it captures
all that through a simple base econ value.

---

It's not entirely correct to judge a country's power by looking at its
military size, its ships, guns. Military power is also a function of
what a country *can build* on demand, when all the chips are
down.. That is deeply related to its industrial, tech capacity, its
economy.

The 'French Trump" is new but if its him against EM, voters will flock
to EM en masse. Say what you will about FR politics, but they have a
long history of giving the far-right the cockblock.

---

Once I heard that "ala KÃ¤rcher" stuff was still a hit in FR politics,
I thought 'they are still regurgitating old stuff from Sarko days over
there?'. That means nothing new is going on... Macron just might win
this thing.

Not sure the Great Game (from the 19th century), the Cold War is
enough to explain the UK/RU animosity.. It is over-the-top in many
ways. They fought against Hitler, Napoleon together. And, ahem,
neither side wants a united, strong Europe. Maybe that's what changed

@mourner is V. Agafonkin, creator of the excellent Leaflet mapping
software. The dynamics maps I share on conflicts, equakes etc were
possible thanks him. LL is open-source, of course.

Some of my friends still consider Vinnytsia as a backup option - as if
far enough away from possible vectors of attacks and at the same time
relatively close to Kyiv"

If as an answer to any Ukraine invasion Japan/US take those disputed
Kuril islands back for Japan, I will laugh my ass off. RU navy wld be
busy near Ukraine, the islands are on the other side of the world
basically, Japan always wanted them back, and I'm sure US would love
to put a big fat base there.

Everyone who lived in US knows, mailboxes would get filled with offers
from credit card companies. X% off! Great opportunity! Hurry now!

---

How do credit card companies end up as villains in a movie?
Easy. Perfectly fits with the stagnating "creditor-paradise" described
before. Stagnant wages, no inflation, low rates.. What does that lead
to? It creates an opportunity for a lender to borrow money cheap and
lending it, adding little interest, to the guy who has a low wage and
wants to buy stuff.
