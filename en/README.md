H2 Central: "Members of The European Parliament Have Decided to
Support a Hydrogen Based Green Transition in The Transport
Sector.. Was another important day for hydrogen economy in Europe and
globally... [The target of a] maximum distance of 100km between each
hydrogen refuelling station, along both the core and comprehensive
TEN-T networks, will mean that by the time the infrastructure is in
place by end of 2027, up to 1,780 HRS could be available across
Europe, suppling up to 1 million ton of hydrogen per year"

What a strange year.. Added this item to [the list](2015/12/1973.html).

Of course, cellular networks also came to being thanks to DARPA, due
to research they pushed in 1973.

Paper: "Can BRICS De-dollarize the Global Financial System?"

Silk Road Briefing: "The BRICS countries are working on establishing a
new reserve currency to better serve their economic interests..  The
new currency will be based on a basket of the currencies of the
five-nation bloc: the Chinese RMB Yuan, the Russian Ruble, the Indian
Rupee, the Brazilian Real and the South African Rand"

Later they fudged QED results six more times

Consa: "With the new experimental data from Franken and Liebes.. [t]he
probative force of QED was upended... It was a fraud, a scandal.  But
the creators of QED refused to accept defeat. QED could not be an
incorrect theory because that placed them in an indefensible
situation. All the developments in the field of theoretical physics
that had occurred in the last decade were based on this theory. All
the privileges they had obtained after the success of the Manhattan
Project were at stake"

---

Dyson reconciled Feynman, Schwinger QED theories, which were
themselves subpar. Infinities are swept under the rug, techniques
Dirac thought illegitimate mathematics were used. The post-war rut in
physics started in the Shelter Island conference, New York.

---

Consa: "According to Dyson, [Physicist Enrico] Fermi also did not
agree with this new way of conducting science.. Fermi asked how many
free parameters he had used to obtain the fit. Smiling after being
told 'Four,' Fermi remarked, 'I remember my old friend Johnny von
Neumann used to say, with four parameters I can fit an elephant, and
with five I can make him wiggle his trunk.'"

---

Oliver Consa: "Something is rotten in the state of [Quantum
Electrodynamics. QED] is considered the most accurate theory in the
history of science. However, this precision is based on a single
experimental value: the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron
(g-factor). An examination of QED history reveals that this value was
obtained using illegitimate mathematical traps, manipulations and
tricks"

When you are ready to switch fields for your Postdoc"

$A^T A$ was surprisingly easy to run concurrently.. 

---

If $A$ is "tall and skinny" ie $A$ is m x n where n is much smaller
than m, there is some trickery using $A^T A$. A can have lots of rows
but $A^T A$ has to be n x n -by definition- which is small. 

---

A lot of linear algebra can be paralelized. Even SVD.
