H2 View: "BP hydrogen team gets a shot in the arm as oil giant bets on
H2.. This announcement has also arrived as the company announced that
it would be purchasing a 40.5 percent stake in an Australian renewable
energy project, which it will also operate. That project is viewed as
one of the largest in the world for the production of green H2"

Bloomberg: "Big Oil Bets That Green Hydrogen Is the Future of
Energy.. The fuel is well suited to the majors’ strengths in project
management and their deep pockets...

This month has seen a flurry of big news about hydrogen..

BP Plc is taking the lead in the $36 billion Asian Renewable Energy
Hub, a project that aims to install 26 gigawatts of solar and wind
farms over a vast 6,500-square-kilometer (2,500 square-mile) stretch
of Western Australia’s Pilbara region, and use the electricity
generated to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. Once
fully developed, each year it would produce about 1.6 million tons of
green hydrogen or 9 million tons of ammonia, which can be used to make
fertilizer...

TotalEnergies SE has joined Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s
conglomerate in a venture that has the ambition to invest as much as
50 billion over the next 10 years in green hydrogen. An initial
investment of $5 billion will develop 4 gigawatts of wind and solar
capacity, about half of which will feed electrolyzers
producing hydrogen used to manufacture of ammonia. The venture could
expand to 1 million tons of annual green hydrogen production by 2030,
driven by 30 gigawatts of clean power.

It's only a matter of time before Shell Plc follows with a megaproject
of its own.. 

US giant Chevron Corp. is ready to spend billions on a mixture of
green and blue hydrogen, which uses a chemical reaction to split
natural gas and capture and store the carbon dioxide... 'Electrons
don't need the type of infrastructure' that the oil majors specialize
in, said Meredith Annex, an analyst at BloombergNEF. But hydrogen is a
molecule and 'these are companies that understand molecules and
infrastructure design around molecules.'

The nature of hydrogen, with its complex processing plants,
pressurized pipelines and storage facilities, and the specialized
tankers required for distribution, makes it 'a lifeline into the
future' for Big Oil, said Annex"

H2 View: "A South-Korean chemicals manufacturer has said it will
establish a plant to produce 50,000 tonnes of hydrogen per year in
Daesan, South Korea, to clean up petrochemical production"

---

DOE: "Currently, most hydrogen in the United States is produced by
large-scale natural gas reforming without carbon capture and
storage. This established technology has been shown to be able to
reach the cost targets; however, the goal is to reach the cost target
via low-carbon pathways.. DOE supports the research and development of
a wide range of technologies [for the goal]"

---

A total transition to clean fuel based infra (generation through CCS,
or renewables where available) can reach Net Zero faster than waiting
for total renewable power generation to catch up hoping one day if all
power generation is clean, all will be clean. Earlier policy made a
huge mistake. First it bet on an inefficient transmision, storage,
end-use solution (electricity) and lived on hope for the generation
part to catch up and 'kill fossil'.

---

Fast is no joke. Standard electric tower can reliably transmit 2.2
GW. An H2 pipeline can transmit over 33 GW with near zero loss.

[[-]](2019/03/wirespipes.html#10calc)

---

Governments can easily mandate (after a transition period) that all
fossil fuel to be used only for H2 generation + CCUS. That guarantees
fast power transmission, plenty of options for storage. Infra becomes
emission-free by default. Put H2 in a car, it's an emission free
car. Use it in houses for heating, it's emission-free heating.

Elections are on the way, but Netanyahu voted against the bill, did a
non-right-wing act just to hurt the government. His opponents from the
right can hit him on the head with it now, possibly steal his votes
and come back stronger.

Al Jazeera: "Israeli coalition fails to pass bill on upholding settler
law.. [the bill] served as a key test of the government’s prospects
for survival, creating a paradoxical situation where some of the
illegal settlements’ biggest opponents in the government voted for the
bill, while hardline parties that support the settlements voted
against the bill in order to weaken the government..

The failure to renew the bill on Monday highlighted the separate legal
systems in the occupied West Bank, where nearly 500,000 Israeli
settlers enjoy the benefits of Israeli citizenship and law while some
3 million Palestinians live under military rule that is now well into
its sixth decade.

The settlements, which are fortified, Jewish-only housing complexes,
are continuing to expand in the occupied West Bank as well as occupied
East Jerusalem. They are seen as a major obstacle to any potential
deal with Israel"

Infoplease: "When the Soviet Union broke up in 1991, the Kaliningrad
Oblast lost its overland connections to Russia, as Lithuania gained
its independence and Poland broke free from the Soviet orbit"

Kaliningrad is RU territory but has no land connection to Russia.
It sits at a tough spot. And Lithuania and Poland are both NATO.
