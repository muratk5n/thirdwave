The restrictions on the gas-fired plants sound fine.

Politico: "EU lawmakers Wednesday voted in favor of a European
Commission proposal to allow nuclear and natural gas-fired power
plants to be marketed as sustainable investments on financial
markets... Under the new rules ‚Äî known as the taxonomy ‚Äî new gas-fired
plants built through 2030 will be recognized as a transitional energy
source as long as they replace a coal- or fuel oil-fired plant, switch
to a low-carbon gas like hydrogen by 2035 and stay under a maximum
emissions cap over 20 years"

"IEA wants surplus nuclear energy to power hydrogen production"

---

This was my worry... focus on pure green sources, while welcome, would
not be enough. All raw sources of energy need to be used, including
fossil. Targeting blue or green H2, we generate clean fuel any way
possible.

"Wind energy is still 25.5 GW short.. EU steel producers are interested
in clean H2 but point to a shortage of renewable energy"

---

H2 Central: "In times of widespread energy crisis, the urgency for
energy independence and need to green the energy system is felt across
Estonia. Anticipating the implementation of European Green Deal
legislation, many organisations and cities have committed to become
climate neutral to future proof their business... Therefore, the first
nationwide Hydrogen Valley ever is now being developed in close
cooperation between three regions, one university and five of the
largest companies in energy and industry in Estonia"

I didn't like a lot of intl actions of the UK gov, but there were some
good moves on domestic energy front.

"@HydrogenCouncil

The new UK Energy Security Bill, introduced to Parliament today, is
set to deliver the biggest proposed changes to energy laws in a
decade. The Bill includes measures to increase investment in
\#hydrogen"

The etimology of the word is com- meaning from Latin, with, together,
and bust as in *busting that ass*, together with the fuel, so you have
com- bust.

H2 View: "Hydrogen heated water set to be trialled in
Australia.. Rinnai Japan has said it has successfully developed a
continuous flow hot water system for the domestic market, using 100%
hydrogen combustion technology, offering zero carbon emissions"

H2 Central: "China Yuchai introduces China‚Äôs largest and highest
horsepower hydrogen engine... With a displacement of 15.93 liters and
a maximum horsepower of 560 horsepower, YCK16H is the largest and most
powerful hydrogen internal combustion heavy-duty engine being launched
in China"

2008-9 was bad, so was 2011-2015.. the new rises are something else.

The show is 'all about revenge'? That's like saying *Fight Club* is
all about fighting.

---

There are some detractors of *The Terminal List*..

---

Description says index shows "durable and nondurable manufacturing,
mining, and utilities", meaning `INDPRO` is the measure of actual
physical stuff being produced in US. It could be useful..

Production hit a ceiling 2008, and it only barely started to surpass
that ceiling recently.

---

Looking at Industrial Production Index from FRED, called `INDPRO`;
interesting.. 

```python
import util; df = util.get_fred(1980, 'INDPRO'); df.plot(grid=True)
```

Trump is all over the news again, getting free publicity.. What does
that sound like? Or when? Sounds like a 2015 to me..

"@behindyourback

Just passed a farm with a big 'no vaccines we trust god sign' next to
the sign advertising that they were selling seedless watermelons"

'People retire too early, we pay too much'; I find such talk
inhumane. A minimum amount should be given to all no matter if they
work, not work, retire, early or late.

Al Jazeera: "US Fed: ‚ÄòMore restrictive‚Äô rates possible if inflation persists"

Politico: "Global hunger figures rose to 828M in 2021, UN says"

Brits also need to reverse this f--king Brexit, it caused nothing but
headaches for you. Join the inner alliance, ditch the outer alliance.

Hahaha.. [just like Thatcher](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-politics-27053536)

"[Earlier, in Jul 6] Asked if he would quit, UK PM Boris Johnson says 'no, no, no'"

Pick someone who is not 'strong on Russia' meaning someone who won't
unnecesarily stir shit up to create trouble for Europe

"Who can replace UK‚Äôs Prime Minister Boris Johnson?"

@JustinTLogan

Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson, out.
