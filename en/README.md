"May offset" is not good enough. Plus only BE from sugar cane is
"carbon neutral". How can you make sure all production of this thing
is made that way? People will cheat. Remember how Volkswagen cheated.

EIA: "Producing and burning ethanol results in emissions of carbon
dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas. However, the combustion of ethanol
made from biomass (such as corn and sugarcane) is considered
atmospheric carbon neutral because as the biomass grows, it absorbs
CO2, which may offset the CO2 produced when the ethanol is burned"

The canisters have bioethanol in them

"Large blue boxes have been popping up across Nairobi in Kenya. They
look like cash machines, but ... dispense a clean cooking fuel [canisters]"

New tech needs to be robust not just shiny.

"@PKovacs7

We have no internet, no power. The mail isn’t delivered. My Amazon
order was supposed to arrive 9/2 but I haven’t seen any of their
trucks. Yet an ancient device for conveying information, relying on
ink & paper, has been sitting on my driveway every morning since
Hurricane Ida"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
