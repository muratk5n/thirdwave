NPR: "477 stranded whales die on remote New Zealand islands.. it
appears their location systems can get confused by gently sloping
sandy beaches. [Scientist] said there is a lot of food for the whales
around the Chatham Islands, and as they swim closer to land, they
would quickly find themselves going from very deep to shallow water.
'They rely on their echolocation and yet it doesn't tell them that
they are running out of water.. They come closer and closer to shore
and become disoriented. The tide can then drop from below them and
before they know it, they're stranded on the beach.'"

[2021] In addition to the U.S., Poland also looks to involve Japan in
their \#nuclear and general #cleanenergy plans, especially eyeing
Gen-IV high-temperature gas reactors (HTGR) for green process heat and

IMO Kwarteng did exactly what was agreed upon with PM but now took the

DOE: "[T]he case for nuclear becomes even more compelling when this
high-quality steam is electrolyzed and split into pure hydrogen and
oxygen. A single 1,000 megawatt nuclear reactor could produce more
than 150,000 tonnes of hydrogen each year. Ten nuclear reactors could
provide about 1.5 million tonnes annually or 15% of current hydrogen
produced in the United States"
