renewable power plant as the company showcased the potential of green
hydrogen production and its exportation"

I read about that; it is an ammonia based combustion engine. 100% clean,
zero emissions.

"Fortescue is undertaking to deliver several key projects... These
projects include:

Developing a ship design powered by green ammonia and trialing that
design in new ammonia engine technology, at scale..

Trialing technology on locomotives to run on green ammonia"

AU, the Middle East, Chile are great places for this tech.

"Stage II [of a Stanwell] facility is expected to produce 4.4
megawatts electric using 17,000 m¬≤ mirrors [in Australia]"

---

At night no sunshine? No problem, there is still gas in the pipeline
network, more than enough for night time usage.

Reflecting, or redirecting sunlight through lenses can give immense
power. Haven't we all used a convex lense to focus sunlight on
something as a kid, and saw it burn? Get sunlight, create heat,
generate fuel. Simple.

---

High-voltage electric grid uses SF6 too.. another reason to
deelectrify, and use H2 pipelines, or ammonia for all long distance
energy transmission, keeping electrification at a minimum. 

---

Wind turbines also use that f-ing [SF6](2019/09/sf6.md), truly disgusting stuff

CSP (Concentrated Solar Power) plants do not require rare earth materials.
All you need is glass and steel to make mirrors which is known tech and
resources for it are abundant. Efficiency at 30% equals solar panel tech.

"Renewable energy development relies upon sufficient quantities of rare
earth minerals, specifically neodymium, terbium, indium, dysprosium,
and praseodymium. These are used in the production of solar panels and
wind turbines"

"[According to climate researcher J. Hansen] After World War II, the
industrial economies of Europe and the United States were revving up
to a level of productivity the world had never seen before. To power
this large-scale expansion of industry, Europeans and Americans burned
an enormous quantity of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas). In
addition to carbon dioxide, burning fossil fuel produces particulate
matter‚Äîincluding soot and light-colored sulfate aerosols. Hansen
suspects the relatively sudden, massive output of aerosols from
industries and power plants contributed to the global cooling trend
from 1940-1970.

'That‚Äôs my suggestion, though it‚Äôs still not proven,' [Hansen]
said. 'There is a nice record of sulfates ..  that shows this type of
particle was peaking in the atmosphere around 1970. And then the ice
core record shows a rapid decline in sulfates, right about the time
nations began regulating their emission.' (Sulfates cause acid rain
and other health and environmental problems.)"

Yes between 40-70s there was a brief cooling in climate; but this
happened partly due to an action hard to replicate. We need to fix the
root of the problem, through green fuels.

---

Got to play with üêç package `netcdf4`. Can be useful later. Lots of
geo data is shared as cdf.

---

Working with raw data is never easy. Berkeley data could be spotty for
earlier years, thx to one suggest from one researcher fixed it through
interpolation.

I said it probably isn't *timely*, didn't say it wouldn't be good! \#Dune

I like the title
