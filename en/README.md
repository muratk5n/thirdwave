TDB: "This Is the Robotic Hand That Could Finally Take Over Your
Job.. [O]ne of the most difficult human parts to mechanically
replicate is the hand. The human hand can accomplish a nearly endless
amount of tasksâ€”not just because of how versatile our hands and
fingers are, but also because we can intuitively determine how much
force to apply. Itâ€™s incredibly challenging, for instance, to teach a
robot how to hold an egg with two fingers firmly without crushing the
shell. A team of South Korean scientists may have just solved this
problemâ€”and perhaps opened the door to robots finally taking over our
jobs"

Note the image of a rich person 200 yrs ago was someone fat (bcz sugar
was rare only the rich could afford it). Now the image of a rich
person is lanky, bcz the wealthy have access to better cooking,
ingredients (through chefs etc), read: less starch, more vegs. The
issue never was the amount eaten, or how much fat.

At the same time typical poor person now is likely to be fat; sugar
and starch has become so prevalent in the market that it is now
feeding (and killing) the poor.

But sugar, starch is bad
