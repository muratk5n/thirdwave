Walmart/Amazon were spending the same amt to generate similar revenue,
then AMZN CapEx started to climb. Now WMT looks better.

Unless.. one is going for diversity in biz (as in AMZN, hasa a cloud biz)

Checking Amazon, Walmart

```python
import yf
ds = ["Revenue  (ttm)", "Capital Expenditure"] 
yf.get_disp("AMZN",ds)
yf.get_disp("WMT",ds)
```

```text
AMZN ['Revenue  (ttm): 443.3B', "Capital Expenditure: ('-52,256,000', '-40,140,000', '-16,861,000')"]
WMT ['Revenue  (ttm): 566.14B', "Capital Expenditure: ('-11,714,000', '-10,264,000', '-10,705,000')"]
```

Makes sense, if you are continuously spending money to make money,
during high inflation u'd need to more of that money to make the same
amount. Sure cld pass the cost to consumers, but that's no fun..

CNBC: "'The best businesses during inflation are the businesses that
you buy once and then you donâ€™t have to keep making capital
investments subsequently,' Buffett said, adding that 'any business
with heavy capital investment tends to be a poor business to be in in
inflation and often itâ€™s a poor business to be in generally.'"

Cerebral sounds too much like my day job.. Some movies try too

Bad review on *Reminiscence* from ABC Oz. "Buckles under the weight of
its own construction in the third act". Darn. Is it like *Tenet*?
"Cerebral"?

Even if there is a single soldier there, that steals valuable
think-time IMO.. Now the country is an "open case", along with other
tasks, you have to worry about it, think about it.. I dont think
central govs have that kind of attn, processing time..

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
