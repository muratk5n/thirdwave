H2 Fuel News: "Is hydrogen fuel the future of California trains? Upon
the announcement of an order of up to 29 H2-powered trainsets, many
wonder if the future is here... The intention is to use the trainsets
to replace the existing state-funded Amtrac California diesel-powered
locomotives that operate push-pull sets... They will be manufactured
in Utah at Stadler’s Salt Lake City factory. The hydrogen fuel cells
will be supplied by Canadian company Ballard. The H2-powered trains
will have a 497-mile operating range"

Beto did ok on gov debate; but staying away from culture war would be
better, circling back everything to econ. Sounded soft immigration
(can be tied to econ) - the line should've been "Abbott is sending one
bus to NE, I will send 10!".

Expl wouldn't have to register to be effective. The carrier Ford

Before the NS sabotage there was talk in Germany to just turn on NS2
damn the consequences - clearly "some people" didn't want this issue
even discussed as an option. But IMO the perps overplayed their

The magic.. I see

"The magic seems to be in the algorithm. Unlike other networks, TikTok
shows you more content based on what's popular and what you're most
interested in, downplaying the accounts you follow. Networks like
Facebook or Instagram show you content based on the accounts you
follow"
