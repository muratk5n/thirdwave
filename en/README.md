Holywood is obsessed with this character.. There is an unending stream
of movies made abt it.. They couldn't even wait for the dust settle on
the last actor (B. Affl), they immediately served a new actor (the
vampire guy).

I suspect propaganda. B. Wayne is rich (BAff version even said as much
in one movie when asked about his powers, answering with "I'm
rich"). BM in the comics is supposed to be an innovator himself, a
detective, but in recent incarnations his toys, BW glamor are more
front and center. The message is this; government is failing (in fact
it always fails, it can't not fail), trust the billionaire to solve
problems for you.

It's true. Wood, which is solid, can be compressed to smaller
size. But water cannot. It is counter-intuitive at first, but actually
makes sense if one thinks about it.

That I could believe.. Anyone studying fluids wld understand. Incompressibility 

"It is well known that underwater explosion cause more damage than the
same amount of explosive detonated in the air"

18 tons teq in the sea caused 3.9. But 1000 tons on land caused 3.3?

earthquake, it was estimated to be 1 kilotons of TNT equivalent.

"The capacity of the German natural gas network is more than 200,000
GWh, which meets the requirements for several months. In comparison,
the capacity of all the German pumped storage power plants only
amounts to about 40 GWh"

The pipeline system itself can be considered as storage; Even when we
are not pumping in new H2, the pipes themselves still have gas in
them. Same is true for natgas.
