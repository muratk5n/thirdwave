in its Southeast, around Montepellier, Marseille, and Corsica. Gigawatt level CSPs
should be possible in these locations.

Actually the truth also has a lot of friends.. Dont knock it.

What does it mean for a hurricane to have 25 GWh energy? Take one of
those 1 GW natgas pipelines that are built to supply *a country*. Line
up 25 of them, and use that massive power to run mega lawnmowers that
just chew through towns, cities, for one hour. Imagine the havoc that
cld be created with that. That is an Ivan, or Sandy.

OK Boomer

"@LeftJaddi

My boomer boss today was talking about how she "worked her ass off to
graduate college with no debt"

I asked her how much tuition was, she said $750 a semester"

"@JHead1984

What kills me about student debt cancellation is the people who would
be angry about it would forget in a week and the people who would be
forgiven would remember it for the rest of their lives. It's such an
easy political win"

The Shat apparently went bankrupt after Trek TOS was canceled (before
syndication made it big), he divorced, lost bunch of money, ended up
living out of his truck for a while, where, one day, on his 4x4 TV he
watched the moon landing live. The contrasts in that story.. The Shat,
his big scifi role (yet unrecognized), but being poor, and watching
actual space discovery taking place on TV.

---

I did watch the Shatner documentary about the events pre, post his
Blue Origin flight into space. Some interesting life stories there..

NFTs seem to have discovered what truly matters in owning content of
any kind -- a proof of connection to its creator. So now rich guy can
show off to his other rich friends "here is art piece content xyz and
its creator gave it to ME". Owning a Picasso was never about the art
for them, it was having a piece of art FROM Picasso. In painting the
art piece assured that connection, NFT offered the same thing for
digital media.
