If all lithium on Earth was mined and turned into batteries, it could
only handle 10% of todays energy requirements. H2, ammonia storage can

"The most worrisome factor is that China's delay might reflect not a
holdup in the preparation of its NDC, but a well-rehearsed plan to
leverage its climate change commitments into other areas where the
Biden administration has increased pressure on Beijing...

First, the weaponization of climate change measures might be seen by
the Biden administration as cutting off the last possibility of
cooperation with China, making the bilateral relationship much more
hostile. This is also a possibility in the case of Europe, given the
increasing importance of climate change in European citizens'
priorities"

There was a manager at DARPA in 2013 who took a chance on mRNA tech;
lined up bunch of research deps for that goal... Who is that guy?
What is his background? In which setting could he do what he did?

Private companies can be vehicles for delivering end-products based on
existing fundamental research, fine. But for orig research, they are
not the right address. Look at all the innovation originating from
DARPA.. They funded, managed so much.

A lot of the gadgets we think we need, we really don't.. Take the
coffee brewer, or the French press; any coffee fine enough for FP can
also be "brewed" in a cup. That's what FP does in fact. Add coffee,
boiling water, wait, pour into another cup through a sieve.
