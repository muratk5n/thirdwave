Slate: "The Clinton-Era Adoption Law That Still Devastates Black Families
Today.. Promoted as a way to rescue childrenâ€”especially Black
childrenâ€”languishing in Americaâ€™s overloaded foster system, ASFA has
had the opposite impact. By speeding up termination of parentsâ€™
rights, it has dramatically increased the chances that Black families,
which are disproportionately separated by state child welfare
authorities, will be permanently torn apart"

From Ignatius Donnelly to Graham Hancock, pseudoarchaeologists claim
an 'advanced Ice Age civilization' spread agriculture.. But
archaeologists actually know a lot about the spread of agriculture!

I hear that on the polls but some say Trump people are not talking to
the pollsters, or giving false data when they do, for fear of being
labeled, since Jan 6.

Slate: "The Bad Bet Tech Companies Made That Got Them Into This
Mess.. companies understood their lockdown-augmented growth curves
might not last forever, but they planned as if they would. Because
while being wrong would mean cutting staff and missing earnings
expectations, not attacking the opportunity would mean losing a market
if COVID-inspired behavior *did* persist. So they took the risk"

If Iger decides to fix cuck, he would have the political capital to do
it. Not likely based on past perf, but just saying..

DIS CEO Chepak is out. He tried to change some stuff but he didn't
have enough political capital.. Add to that recent losses, he was
done. Much of the Woke junk started during (returning CEO) Iger's time
anyway, but maybe he was clear on where to go cuck and how much, and
was steady about it. News says he will chose a successor, if he choses
well, he will leave on a high note next time.
