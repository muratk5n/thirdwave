"@AusGov_OSALET [Feb 2022, Alan Finkel]

Good news from the fourth India-Australia Energy Dialogue!
@AngusTaylorMP and @OfficeOfRKSingh have signed the Letter of Intent
on New and Renewable Energy Technology. The focus is on ultra low-cost
\#solar and clean \#hydrogen"

"Suncor getting out of wind and solar; will shift focus to hydrogen and
renewable fuel..  the Calgary-based company says it still intends to
be net-zero emissions by 2050, but will accelerate progress towards
that target by focusing on hydrogen and renewable fuels instead..

[They will replace] coke-fired boilers at its Base Plant oilsands
project near Fort McMurray, Alta., with lower emission cogeneration
units, as well as accelerating commercial-scale deployment of carbon
capture technology...

It also notes it’s partnering with ATCO on a project to build a
world-scale hydrogen project in Alberta and deploying next-generation
renewable fuel technologies like LanzaJet’s sustainable aviation fuel
technology and Enerkem’s waste-to-fuels technology"

Some claim the dimming event triggered seismic changes in history;
famine displaced people who displaced others, discredited some
existing religions increased interest for new ones (eg Islam, Mohammed
was born in 570).

History Channel: "[I]n 536 A.D., much of the world went dark for a
full 18 months, as a mysterious fog rolled over Europe, the Middle
East and parts of Asia. The fog blocked the sun during the day,
causing temperatures to drop, crops to fail and people to die... 

Now, researchers have discovered one of the main sources of that
fog. The team reported in Antiquity that a volcanic eruption in
Iceland in early 536 helped spread ash across the Northern Hemisphere,
creating the fog. Like the 1815 Mount Tambora eruption—the deadliest
volcanic eruption on record—this eruption was big enough to alter
global climate patterns, causing years of famine.

What exactly did the first 18 months of darkness look like? The
Byzantine historian Procopius wrote that 'the sun gave forth its light
without brightness, like the moon, during this whole year.' He also
wrote that it seemed like the sun was constantly in eclipse"

New Scientist: "In the year 536 the sun dimmed and the world shivered,
leading to famine, plague and the fall of empires"

Hey I like this "neomodernism"

Wiki: "Neomodernists maintain that truth still exists in a universal
form and directly refute existentialist and postmodern viewpoints that
the essence of an existent is formed in the observer's
bias. [N]eomodernism rejects postmodernism as:

Unscientific: the ability of science to generate useful knowledge
cannot be waved away as "scientism".

Journalism: as not giving any explanation as to how or why things
happen.

Local: as being unable to recognize patterns that occur across time or
location.

Unverified: as lacking any validation process, and therefore
proceeding by fad and hierarchy"

FT: "The UK government says it is ‘unsustainable’ to continue to spend
£2bn a month on free Covid testing for the general public"
