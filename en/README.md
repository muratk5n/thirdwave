"higher aspirations" tho.

"New York City to require proof of Covid vaccination for indoor
activities including restaurants and gyms"

I hear some of this "keep it local" talk in some leftist circles as
well.. there the emphasis is in more "social", like they want to
"socially" talk about funding each streetlight, and "socially"
decide. Still professional politician is still better IMO

"The Short, Unhappy Life of a Libertarian Paradise.. *This American
Life* did a segment portraying Springs citizens as the ultimate
anti-tax zealots, willing to pay $125 in a new 'Adopt a Streetlight'
program to illuminate their own neighborhoods, but not willing to
spend the same to do so for the entire city. 'Ill take care of mine'
was the gist of what one council member heard from a resident when she
confronted him with this fact...

From disruption came, well, too much disruption. And from that came a
full-circle return to professional politicians. Including one.. who is
so persuasive he has gotten Colorado Springs residents to do something
the outside world assumed they were not capable of: Five years after
its moment in the spotlight, revenue is so high that the same voters
who refused to keep the lights on have overwhelmingly approved ballot
measures allowing the city to not only keep some of its extra tax
money, but impose new taxes as well"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
