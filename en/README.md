Someone told the crew "get me some code!" they got it, but to make it
look dense, "hi-tech" they removed the indentation. It's all for the
looks right? This is Holywood.

indentation.

AP: "The phrase 'Let‚Äôs go Brandon' refers to a meme that emerged
earlier this month from a video of an interview with NASCAR driver
Brandon Brown after he won an Xfinity Series race at Alabama‚Äôs
Talladega Superspeedway.

A reporter said on air that fans behind him were chanting 'Let‚Äôs go
Brandon,' when video footage indicates the actual chant was 'F--- Joe
Biden.' Some people have suggested the reporter purposefully
misinterpreted the crowd‚Äôs chant and the quote has become a
catchphrase among critics of Biden"
