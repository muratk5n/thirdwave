kind damage, the kind that kills jobs)

"Although machines like [the sorter below] look incredibly complex,
[manager] says that they are actually pretty simple. The decision to
whether or not to reject a piece of produce (or stone, or clod of
earth, as often happens) is a yes/no question that can be answered
without much calculation. Likewise, because the rejectors are spread
out in line, it's just a matter of timing to pick the right one to
knock out the offending article. And over the years the machines have
gotten good"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
