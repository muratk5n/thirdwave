I see.. now that I think about it the attack came across as bizarrely
assertive in an ill-timed kind of way..  was that the hallmark of the
previous administration? (remember the tax cut debacle). Then possibly
Tory members got wind, plus the tax thing, MPs got rid of gov in a
jif.

Putin: "The so-called 'cancel culture' and in reality is the
cancellation of culture, is eradicating everything that is alive and
creative and stifles free thought in all areas, be it economics,
politics.. Today, liberal ideology itself has changed beyond
recognition. If initially, classic liberalism was understood to mean
the freedom of every person to do and say as they pleased, in the 20th
century the liberals started saying that the so-called open society
had enemies and that the freedom of these enemies could and should be
restricted if not cancelled"

self-oxidizing.. Extremely stupid tech.

AccuWeather: "Electric vehicles catch aflame during Ian aftermath..
in the wake of the Category 4 hurricane that hit the state last month,
these vehicles have been more akin to a time bomb. Saltwater flooding
in the state’s coastal areas caused the lithium ion batteries in
electric vehicles to combust, catching fire.. Eric Wachsman, director
of Maryland’s Energy Institute, stated that the qualities of lithium
ion battery cells.. make these cells vulnerable to ignition, due to
the cells having closely placed electrodes that are filled with a
flammable liquid electrolyte.

Apparently Rust has some memory check features, better than C (current
language suppored by the kernel). Memory management is the source of a
lot of bugs, security issues, especially at that low-level coding a
kernel requires.

Politico: "Gavin Newsom has quietly constructed one of the biggest
digital forces in politics.. The governor has 6 million emails and 1.5
million phone numbers. It’s a massive tool, and it’s led to a logical
