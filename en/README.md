Mfkers dont know how to demo stress analysis, fracture mech.  Build
the math mod for a structure, make sure it is little funky, apply
stress, watch it break in an unexpected way; then compute model which
shows breakage in the same place. Now that's teaching...

FCE's carbon capture *generates* energy? Awesome if true.

"FuelCell Energy’s platform can run on natural gas or biogas. Natural
gas and biogas both contain methane, a chemical compound with one
carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms (CH4). Fuel cells use an
electrochemical process to convert hydrogen-rich fuels into electrical
power and heat. Inside the fuel cell, methane is steam-reformed at 600
degrees Celsius and converted into hydrogen and CO2. The fuel cell
produces electricity, heat, water, and CO2, which can be exhausted or
captured...

[FCE] plants produce additional power rather than consume it during
the carbon capture process. By comparison, conventional carbon capture
technologies consume about 20 percent of a plant’s overall power
output"

H2 Central: "[US] FuelCell Energy, sees momentum in South Korea clean

capture and concentrate carbon dioxide from industrial sources and
produce hydrogen"

Reshare on sub analysis by [Beckley](2021/03/unrivaled-beckley.md#sub).
In regional terms CH is on a more equal footing, but the other side will
be full of surprises, if things go that far.

Do we know all the details of this incident? US wasn't performing
anti-sub exercise at the time. They might also have seen the sub but
kept it to themselves to hide their own detection capabilities.. 

"In 2006 A Chinese submarine came close to the USS Kitty Hawk carrier
group, they beat their defenses"

From now on assume shared code has `import util as u`

It looks fine, will check later versions

Some other dude DIY publishing UA-RU border data

---

This data is not curated, so not 100% reliable. I see a town called
Pisky occuring a few times in the file, all of them seemingly under UA
control... But latest news suggest RU has this town.

```
695980,Pisky-Richytski
695981,Pisky
695982,Pyaski
695983,Pisky
```
