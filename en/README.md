Note the policy-fu.. Could we "poll bunch of people" on the street and
create equally significant policy? I don't think so.

Hydrogen Europe: "Following the plenary vote on the Renewable Energy
Directive II (REDII), Hydrogen Europe wholeheartedly welcomes the
historical European Parliament (EP) decision to commit to ambitious
binding renewable targets and to simplify the regulatory framework...

Further good news from the parliament today is the return of the
additionality principle to legal regulation, rather than delegating
this to the European Commission via the Delegated Act of RED II. This
will ease the implementation of the additionality principle for
renewable hydrogen. MEPs have listened to the sector‚Äôs concerns that
overly strict regulations would hinder the development of this crucial
market. Hydrogen Europe fully recognises the importance, and supports,
the principle of additionality but has expressed concerns regarding
the practical implementation of the proposed criteria, not the
principle itself. The task at hand is to find a balance between
ensuring green hydrogen is produced from new renewable energy capacity
and avoiding excessive constraints on a nascent market"

For the Py interface had to go to sources, run `configure` and `make`.
Do people still know how to do that, or do you go to TikTok and
just dance about it?

A lot of the black cultural artifacts have Southern flavor (ie
American), repackaged. The showy parts were created so mainstream
could play Dances with Wolves with it. It is hilarious I refer to it
but may not be beneficial for its supposed owners.

A black kid born into the culture, same way.. Everyone gets culture,
by merely being in it.

That means first, second generation "Irish" doesn't become 100% of
what their ancestors were, they [assimilate](2014/06/the-culture-code.html#imprint),
into a culture that is only 10% of that. They will never be 100% Irish. 

---

Immigrants contribute to culture prop to their size... 10% of United
States is of Irish desc, that makes them 10% Irish in culture.
