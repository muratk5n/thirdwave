H2 Fuel News: "First hydrogen fuel cell car in India is the Toyota
Mirai"

---

H2 generation from NG using steam-methane reforming + CCS is one of
the cheapest methods. Both of those suppliers should be able to
produce the needed supply. They obviously also have some mad solar DNI.

Al Jazeera: "Germany courts Qatar and UAE for alternatives to Russian
gas.. Habeck, before the trip starting on Saturday, said the goal was
to 'establish a hydrogen partnership in the medium term'"

---

H2 Fuel News: "A state-of-the-art coating facility [for the generation
of cost-competitive green hydrogen] is being developed by TFP Hydrogen
Products in North America"

Movie backdrop is the 80s.. Ancient history!

---

Panama (2022), good movie.. the rhythm feels different, un-Holywood,
but that's fine.

The show on WeWork called *WeCrashed* should be named WeSuck. Thumbs down.

Two words: Indo-China

Jane's Defense: "DARPA sets goals for Liberty Lifter heavy-lift
seaplane.. The US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
has revealed ambitions to develop and flight test an experimental low
cost, wing-in-ground effect-capable seaplane for long-range, low-cost
seaborne strategic and tactical lift"

RU is a weapons exporter would not have urgent need for weapons from
others. This is a mudslinging move to shame China into their corner.

NDTV: "Amid Flack, China's US Envoy Says Beijing Now Not Sending Arms To Russia"

---

RU invades UKR, an outer outpost on its border, the most fervent
denials come from US, UK, Oz. Distance-wise these countries are far,
far away, the feverishness of the protest makes no sense; but from a
larger view it does.

---

France has been active on the high-seas, a seafaring nation, but its
history and strategic needs is too tied to the greater Eurasian
landmass, so it mostly behaves like an inner. That is why FR is never
accepted to "the club", the "Five Eyes"; see the recent AUKUS debacle.
They didn't just kick out France, they reveled in it.

---

It might make sense to look at the broad IR landscape through a inner
vs belter (outer) lens, using terminology of *The Expanse*. China,
Russia, Europe are the "inners", US, Oz, UK the outers. Outers want
the inners to stay where they are, contained. 

---

Interesting to note during WWII when Japan was attacking Soviets, and
China, the US was fine with that. After the northward attack stalled
though, and Japan changed focus to the south, the islands, then US put
sanctions on Japan cutting its oil (which triggered a Japanese gamble
on Pearl Harbor to cripple US while it could take all those resources,
US responded).

But US priority was clear, attack the land-based powers, keep them
locked in their places, that's fine.. If you try to be a naval power
yourself, you are in trouble. When Japan tried that it was nuked,
firebombed into submission.

Guy sets up an entire heating/cooking system with chimney at camp, in
a tent. Extremely wasteful IMO.

Beans are high on fiber. Cheese, eggs; low.

.. which means high food-to-poop ratio (or low poop-to-food). Less
