NDTV: "Peru's leftist president Pedro Castillo was ousted by
lawmakers..

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, one of Castillo's
staunchest allies, blamed 'economic and political elites' for a
hostile environment since the beginning of his 'legitimate
presidency.'

The government of Gustavo Petro, Colombia's first left-wing president,
called for dialogue involving 'all political actors,' adding that
'democracy requires the recognition of the popular will expressed both
in the elections for president and for Congress.'

Brazil was more critical of Castillo's actions, calling his attempt to
dissolve Congress a 'violation' of democracy and the rule of law"

H2 Fuel News: "U.S. researchers [from UofSC and FSU] created hydrogen
fuel by mimicking [a process that is referred to as the Z-Scheme in
natural photosynthesis].. In their study, the scientists combined two
molecules. One was a photoredox catalyst, for instance a catalyst that
can move electrons with light. The other was naphthol, which is a
fluorescent organic compound.. These combined molecules were exposed
to light and each molecule absorbed a photon and then worked together
to produce hydrogen fuel."

Investor: "A whole generation has forgotten about the late 1990s, and
so a lot of people who are buying these stocks or the Bitcoin
craziness never saw these things go down 90 or 99 percent like my
generation did. We saw a bull market phenomenon in the late 90s, and
when the market turned down and the glasses became half empty and not
half full, the access to capital dried up overnight. If you have
positive cash flow you can survive, but if your burn rate is really
high and capital markets shut down for six months, you’re dead"
