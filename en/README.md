Water shortage worries? Clean water will be all about
energy. Desalination is getting cheaper.. Energy consumption of
seawater desalination reached as low as 4 kWh/m3. If we can increase
energy output, especially green energy output, we can heat, cool,
desalinate to our heart's content.

House prices were (are) up because FED rates were low (2 yrs ago was
start of covid). In low rate environments too much speculative money
chases housing, raising the price.. If two years ago the rates were
higher, US would not be in this situation today.

---

Time shift housing (2 yrs back) and check against rent, to see if
house price changes in the past caused rent increases,

```python
df.incrent.corr(df.inchouse.shift(24))
```

```text
Out[1]: 0.612
```

Not a small effect there.. since we time shifted, hint at causation

That means it takes ~2 years for house price changes to effect rent changes.

If there is mega rent increase now there was mega house price increase
2 years ago

YoY rent and house price % increases below,

```python
import urllib.request as urllib2, time as timelib
import pandas as pd, datetime
from pandas_datareader import data

today = datetime.datetime.now()
start=datetime.datetime(1970, 1, 1)
end=datetime.datetime(today.year, today.month, today.day)
cols = ['CUUR0000SEHA','MSPUS']
df = data.DataReader(cols, 'fred', start, end)
df = df.interpolate()

df['incrent'] = (df.CUUR0000SEHA-df.CUUR0000SEHA.shift(12))/df.CUUR0000SEHA.shift(12)*100
df['inchouse'] = (df.MSPUS-df.MSPUS.shift(12))/df.MSPUS.shift(12)*100

plt.figure()
ax1 = df.incrent.plot(color='blue', grid=True, label='rent inc %')
ax2 = df.inchouse.plot(color='red', grid=True, label='house price inc %',secondary_y=True)
h1, l1 = ax1.get_legend_handles_labels()
h2, l2 = ax2.get_legend_handles_labels()
plt.legend(h1+h2, l1+l2, loc=2)
plt.savefig('out.png')

Paper on long-run relation between housing prices and rent. Says there
is causality with a delay. Let's check.

Rent, one of the most basic payments that many millions of Americans
have to pay monthly, is just one of the things that has exploded in
cost lately"

Oz deputy PM too said some mild things about Assange, that he is an
Australian citizen -which is true- and should not be tried abroad, and
some odd stuff (!) happened afterwards.. His SMS some time ago talking
shit on the sitting PM, his coalition partner, were leaked. Weird.

Pak PM Imran Khan is in trouble? IK isn't exactly pro-establishment,
world-order kind a guy.. I heard him defend Julian Assange once.
