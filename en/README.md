Nathan Lewis: "Everything needs to be decarbonized. My passion, our
research, is to do that by the silver bullet, which is to take the
biggest resource known to mankind, the Sun, and store it in the most
dense form known to man other than the nucleus of an atom, chemical
bonds.. Our job is...  to do photosynthesis with the Sun to make
chemical fuels that can be used to power our grids, store our
energy, work as our transportation fuels"

That is fantastic. Prof Nathan Lewis, eh?

Why did Rudolph Diesel not continue with ammonia engines? Production
of NH3 at huge amounts was probably a factor. Refining crude oil,
especially of a certain kind, isn't too hard.  But that was a long
time ago, we had a long time to work on ammonia production tech, plus
there is new urgency around the issue.

I read about that; it is apparently an ammonia based combustion
engine. 100% clean, zero emissions.

"Fortescue is undertaking to deliver several key projects... These
projects include: Developing a ship design powered by green ammonia
and trialing that design in new ammonia engine technology, at
scale.. Trialing technology on locomotives to run on green ammonia"

Global conflict [stats](2019/05/confstats.md) for September.

Afghanistan deaths way down (surprise), from over 4000. Incident count
too high for Mexico, though deaths not much.. drug related attacks,
sabotage, explosion maybe, but not direct homicide? Yemen, Nigeria
were at the top.
