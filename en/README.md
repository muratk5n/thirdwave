True on Bay right? Bland stories but his movies just grind it out,
scene after scene, explosion by explosion..  Every scene is visually
pleasing, feels like they need to be paid attention to, but
underneath.. there isn't much.

Kosinski directed *Top Gun Maverick*? *Oblivion* was a great movie.

Good story with good directing is Hitchcock.

Good directing without good story is Michal Bay.

Couldn't they cut them in? Russia I mean; somehow make them part of
the process, so they would have less of an incentive to invade?

Energy will always find customers.

Even Europe can get that same energy they boycott eventually as
"Hungarian blend", or "Latvian Blend" one day.

"Putin scored an own goal by invading Ukraine it will put his Europe
energy exports at risk"

"The Russian sniper is a specially selected and skilled soldier
who.. is part of the target acquisition system... Objectives of a
sniper team during en masse employments are to hinder or channelize
movement of tactical formations and then direct artillery fire on
prioritized targets...

In Russian Military culture, artillery is called the 'God of War.'
Whereas U.S. forces rely on artillery to support maneuver, the
Russians take the opposite approach: maneuver supports artillery.
Artillery is the decisive finishing arm for the Russian Army..

The employment of UAS by Russian Forces adds another dimension to
their fires capability.  In Eastern Ukraine, Russian Forces have
demonstrated their ability to direct and adjust fires with their
drones. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly seen a systematic approach by
the Russians to acquire a target with a UAS. A high level UAS will
identify a Ukrainian target. It will then pass off that target to
another lower level UAS to determine the target coordinates. Then the
Russians will adjust their fire with the UAS based on the initial
artillery strikes. The total time for this process can be as little as
10-15 minutes...

One thing noticeably absent from Russian UAS employment is the kind of
surgical drone strike that the U.S. has used to great effect in the
past 15 years. Russia does not currently possess a weaponized UAS
similar to a Predator"

Look at the potential new gas fields; all areas being invaded right now

That translates to approx 12 gboe (gigabarrels of oil equivalent),
about one tenth of largest known oil field. Not bad. That'll push a
man to invade combined with all other insecurities building up at
those borders.

Wiki: "The Yuzivska gas field is a Ukrainian natural gas field that
was discovered in 2010. It was expected to begin production in 2017,
but development was halted because of the outbreak of the 2014 war in
the Donbas region. The total proven reserves of the Yuzivska gas field
are around 70.8 trillion cubic feet"
