People vote on their well-being, will oscillate between choices, to a
certain extent guided by a rough ideology -- formed by what see in
front of them. They can choose, but they can't create choices. Like a
customer can choose between iPhone, or Android, or this car or that
car, but they can't create car. In the absence of a car, if you asked
them, they would want a faster horse carriage.

Thought leaders, then, must take steps to represent, politically, all
possible choices in the political sphere. These choices will naturally
emerge within the leading group, modernity allows only so many anyway,
and eventually a suitable palette is found.

Instead of traveling to the space for a few minutes, how about all the
billionaires buy Elsevier and make it a nonprofit organisation towards
making research accessible to everyone?

Or,
Can we crowd-fund and do it on our own?"

Sometimes they recall, then they don't want to recall..

They should've never had this ability in the first place.

"A majority of California likely voters would support overhauling the
state's recall process to make it harder to remove elected officials
mid-term, according to a poll released Wednesday"

Industrial Age society, the Second Wave began in Western Europe with
the Industrial Revolution, and subsequently spread across the
world. Key aspects of Second Wave society are the nuclear family, a
factory-type education system and the corporation. The Third Wave is
the post-industrial society based on hi-tech with all its benefits and
adverse effects causing major attitude shifts in society. Institutions
are built around methods of production, so when a new wave arrives,
older structures around governance, education, health start to crumble
despite the best efforts of people working in them.
