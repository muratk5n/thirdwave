Zuboff: An analogy could be Henry Ford, who produced his Model T, not realizing that he had just invented mass production. In such a situation today is Apple. [..B]ecause it is clear that [..] the importance of the Model T was not the Model T. The importance of the iPod is not the device, but the logic underlying it.

The Model T was the beginning of mass production. This era meant much more than all existing cars or machines or factories. This arose entirely new legal, economic and social institutions. From the highways to the unions, contracts, wage structures. The iPod is the beginning of our new information age. We are at the beginning of the beginning of the beginning. Let's make no mistake here. In forty, fifty years we will have completely new structures and institutions.

Because [Apple] took what the people wanted, songs, music from the old hierarchical structures of the music industry, secured the whole digital music and handed the individuals [the music] when and how they wanted. [That's what people] want today. We feel as individuals and want to be networked and connected. We want to [have a ] voice, we want community, but on our own terms. Apple said, "Andrea, [tell us] who you are, what you like. How can I help you?" Which is the absolute reverse, mirror for mass production [v true, Henry Ford famously said 'you can have your car in any color you want as long as it's black']. Said: "Sorry, dear customer, you have to accept what we offer to you already you want it cheap, so it can only be standardized!." 100 years ago, we wanted everything cheap. Today the product needs to be affordable, but [also] it should be for me. Just for me.
