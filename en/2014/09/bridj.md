# Bridj

There are a number of startups trying to change the way passengers get
around urban environments [..] Boston-based Bridj [r]ather than
launching another single ride-hailing service [..] is building a
series of dynamically generated bus routes [..]

From a user point of view, customers sign up, identify their origin
and destination points, and then Bridj tells them where to go to meet
one of its minibuses. Rather than use the same static routes as your
usual city bus routes, Bridj dynamically designs routes that aggregate
commuter pickups where demand is highest.

That leads to sub-10 minute wait times, as well as much faster
commutes than its passengers are used to.

generated bus-routes, perfect example.
