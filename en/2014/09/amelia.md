# Amelia

IPsoft today announced a new artificial intelligence platform named
“Amelia” that makes it possible to automate knowledge work across a
broad range of functions. Exposed to the same information as any new
hire, she can quickly apply her knowledge to solve queries in a wide
range of business processes. With Amelia able to shoulder the burden
of tedious, often laborious tasks, she partners with human coworkers
to achieve new levels of productivity and service quality.

Whereas many other technologies demand that humans adapt their
behavior in order to interact with ‘smart machines’, Amelia is
intelligent enough to interact like a human herself [...]

Amelia learns using the same natural language manuals as her
colleagues [..]. She understands the full meaning of what she reads
rather than simply recognizing individual words. This involves
understanding context, applying logic and inferring implications.

There are big claims, I hope they are true. More automation is a good
thing.
