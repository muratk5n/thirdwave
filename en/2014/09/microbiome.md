# Microbiome

You could be sitting alone and still be completely outnumbered for your 
body is home to trillions upon trillions of tiny passengers – bacteria. 
Your body is made up of around ten trillion cells, but you harbour a hundred trillion
 bacteria [...] This is your ‘microbiome’ and it has a huge impact on your health, your 
ability to digest food and more. We, in turn, affect them. Everything 
from the food we eat to the way we’re born influences the species of 
bacteria that take up residence in our bodies.
