# Holy Frack

After California state regulators shut down 11 fracking wastewater
injection wells last July over concerns that the wastewater might have
contaminated aquifers used for drinking water and farm irrigation, the
EPA ordered a report within 60 days [..] The letter, a copy of which
was obtained by the Center for Biological Diversity, reveals that
nearly 3 billion gallons of wastewater were illegally injected into
central California aquifers and that half of the water samples
collected at the 8 water supply wells tested near the injection sites
have high levels of dangerous chemicals such as arsenic, a known
carcinogen that can also weaken the human immune system, and thallium,
a toxin used in rat poison [..].

Adding insult to injury, fracking is a water-intensive process, using
as much as 140,000 to 150,000 gallons per frack job every day,
permanently removing it from the water cycle.

Some in Germany wanted to try this new oil exploration thingy, but then the beermakers came out and said: No you are not. And the whole thing stopped dead in its tracks. That was very cool. Thanks to beermakers.
