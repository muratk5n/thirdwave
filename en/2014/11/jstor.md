# JSTOR

[The image] is from page 4 of more than 3K pages of internal emails 
from ITHAKA.org, which is the non-profit responsible for the JSTOR 
digital library (whose mission is “to foster widespread access to the world’s body of scholarly knowledge”).
 It’s a couple of systems administrators communicating in the context of
 high download activity going on at MIT (which we later learn was Aaron 
Swartz downloading academic papers).

Sadly, despite its mission, JSTOR  believes it is no longer capable 
of sustaining itself in the digital era without resorting to restricting
 access to knowledge [..] 

For its part, JSTOR settled a civil suit with Aaron Swartz out of 
court, and later told the US Attorney’s office in Massachusetts that it 
no longer had an interest in further proceedings. The US Gov’t didn’t 
stop, however [..] The FBI
 had much worse in mind for him (and succeeded in doing) for the act of 
downloading PDFs. It culminated in the unnecessary loss of his life.
