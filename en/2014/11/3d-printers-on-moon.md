# 3D Printers, On the Moon

Mankind has taken one small step closer to colonising the Moon after
the European Space Agency (ESA) revealed its latest plans to provide
affordable housing – something we can’t even manage in London
[..T]hanks to the magic of 3D printing, experts say the first people
could be living on the Moon in as little as 40 years. The ESA’s latest
video briefing shows more fleshed-out plans for how robotic 3D
printers on wheels would, with a single unit, collect material from
the surface of the Moon and convert it into a radiation- and
meteor-resistant coating for human accommodation.

This must be the equivalent of "sharks with frickin laser beams
attached to their heads", in space exploration... Very cool.
