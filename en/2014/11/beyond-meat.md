Meat. For many of us, it’s what’s for breakfast, lunch and
dinner. It’s been that way since the prehistoric age. And thanks to a
growing middle class, worldwide demand for meat is exploding. By 2022,
meat production in China and India is expected to grow by 80 percent.

But plenty of obstacles exist. Raising cattle is expensive and hard on
the environment. And meat is high in fat and cholesterol.

Game Changers all over the world are trying to come up with viable
meat alternatives. In the Netherlands, scientists developed the
world's first in-vitro hamburger.

And the Missouri-based company Beyond Meat thinks it has the solution
to satisfy our cravings: food that looks and tastes just like meat —
but is made of plants.  It is such a good imitation, in fact, that
Whole Foods customers couldn't tell the difference when a brief mix-up
occurred last year.
