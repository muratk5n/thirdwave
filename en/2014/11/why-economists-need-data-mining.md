# Why Economists Need Data Mining

http://ineteconomics.org/video/30-ways-be-economist/cosma-shalizi-why-economics-needs-data-mining

Interview with the statistician Cosma Shalizi; I read his book on data
analysis and I like his style: Based on real statistics, empirical,
supported with code, geared towards misconceptions and also aiming to
complement existing knowledge with experience. Excellent.

I'd also suggest the Nobel prize for economics to be suspended until the economists get this right, but that'd be too inflammatory. So I wont say it.
