# More Demand, Less Load

Imagine if we lived in a world where more demand meant less load for a
webserver. Imagine if we lived in a world where no organization could
take down a website, and everyone could publish a site with no hassle
or upfront cost. SyncNet is a first step into that world.

SyncNet is an experimental new browser built on top of BitTorrent Sync
and (soon) Colored Coins. Every time you access a site, you store all
of its contents on your machine. The next user to request the site can
get the contents from both your machine and the original server.

This is in line with 3W. Less centralization, less
concentration. Great!
