# More Sy for Fy

This has to be good news to any fan of Stargate or quality science
fiction: Syfy Channel, the cable network that took a lot of heat for
changing its name and effectively walking away from the genre a few
years ago, wants to get back in the game. The network wants to do
fewer procedurals and B-movies and more traditional, scripted science
fiction drama â€” be it regular series or high-profile mini-series
events.
