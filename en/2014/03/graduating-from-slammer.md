A recent report found that jailing an inmate in New York City for one
year costs more than four years of tuition at an Ivy League
university. The Independent Budget Office found that in 2012 it cost
the city $167,731 to hold each of its daily average of 12,287 inmates,
or about $460 per inmate per day.

Undergraduate tuition at Harvard University is $38,891 annually, or
$155,564 for a four-year degree. Of those inmates, more than 2,000
were being held for drug offenses, surpassing the number for murders
or robberies.
