# Your Facebook Worth: $100

Doug Laney, vice president of research at Gartner, a market research
firm, crunched the numbers during the period before the initial public
offering (IPO) and reckoned that Facebook had collected 2.1 trillion 
pieces of “monetizable content” between 2009 and 2011, such as
“likes,” posted material, and comments. Compared against its IPO
valuation, this means that each item, considered as a discrete data
point, had a value of about five cents.  Another way of looking at it
is that every Facebook user was worth around $100, since users are the
source of the information that Facebook collects.
