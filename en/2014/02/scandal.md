# Scandal

Land of Kebab is in disarray. There are allegations PM stashed tens of millions at a home, in cash, which would naturally be as a result of kickbacks from businessmen; there is a recording between PM and his son discussing how to move this cash to somewhere else. Are these recordings genuine? Naturally noone believes the other side's audio analysis, in this case, individuals with skills and with no axe to grind can be the best source of information. An audio sound engineer analyzed it and decided that the conversation is genuine. In that case, it is bad juju for all involved.
