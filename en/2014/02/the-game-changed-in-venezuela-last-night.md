# The Game Changed in Venezuela Last Night

The game changed in Venezuela last night [..] What we have this
morning is no longer the Venezuela story you thought you understood.

Throughout last night, panicked people told their stories of
state-sponsored paramilitaries on motorcycles roaming middle class
neighborhoods, shooting at people and  storming into apartment
buildings, shooting at anyone who seemed like he might be
protesting. People continue to be arrested merely for protesting, and
a long established local Human Rights NGO makes an urgent plea for an
investigation into widespread reports of torture of detainees. There
are now dozens of serious human right abuses: National Guardsmen
shooting tear gas canisters directly into residential buildings. We
have videos of soldiers shooting civilians on the street. And that’s
just what came out in real time, over Twitter and YouTube, before any
real investigation is carried out.

Sounds pretty bad.
