iversity, a Berlin-based MOOCs platform that’s hoping to become the Coursera of Europe, has managed to pull in nearly 500,000 course sign-ups in the four months since its first massively open online courses went live.

iversity launched its first batch of 24 course in mid-October – noting at the time that it had clocked up initial student sign-ups of more than 100,000. Four months on, it’s bolstered that figure to half a million. Not bad going for a newbie on the MOOCs scene.

Awesome
