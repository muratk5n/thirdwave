# No More Excel Sheets for That Man

Some on the Net created a Github project called "Capital in the 21st
Century in R", the contributors are attempting to reproduce all graphs
and computations of Piketty's book in R language (the author
apparently used Excel). To Piketty's credit, his sheets were shared
and data is (somewhat?) accessible; but sharing reproducible code /
data written in a sane programming language, through Github,
preferably displayable in an ipython noteebook (which also allows
running R code BTW) is much better. One post here shows how using
equally spaced x-axis (which is a quite normal thing to do), changes
the shape of the graph.
