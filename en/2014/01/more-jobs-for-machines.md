# More Jobs for the Machines

Howard talks about the dangers of better AI which is human joblessness. This can be mitigated by creating a digital currency that has "social support" built in; It should be easy to mine this e-cash (a variant of Litecoin perhaps), and IMO, the quota for this money should grow proportional to the people in the system, and "old money" is aged --  taken out of the system. This way mining goes on indefinitely, and people have incentive to spend it rather than collect it.

Giving people money directly (or letting them to mine it themselves) rather than indirectly through a government program is much better because people will make better decisions on how to spend it. This money would never be in huge amounts that would stop people from creating value (which is not the same thing anymore as "working" or "having a job"), and gaining more money through the value they create in the society. Yes, we can lose lower tier service jobs because of this, even before AI arrives that'll do all jobs, but that is actually a good thing. I dont need a barista to get my coffee, or a guy "flippin burgers" to eat my burger.
