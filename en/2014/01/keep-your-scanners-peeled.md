This year will mark another key milestone in self-driving 
technology. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) 
is widely expected to announce standards and mandates for car-borne 
beacons that will broadcast location information to other vehicles on 
the road. The beacons will warn drivers when a collision seems 
imminent—when the car ahead breaks hard, for example, or another vehicle
 swerves erratically into traffic. Automakers may then use this 
information to take the next step: program automated responses.
