A few weekends ago it was time for my kids to choose how to spend the two hours of "screen time" they‘re allowed on Saturdays and Sundays. I suggested that it was a great day for Star Wars and gave them a choice. They could watch any of the six movies on magnificent DVD, on a huge hi-def projection screen with surround sound audio and popcorn. Or they could go on YouTube and watch Lego stop-motion animations of Star Wars scenes created by nine-year- olds. It was no contest—they raced for the computer. It turns out that my kids, and many like them, aren‘t really that interested in Star Wars as created by George Lucas. They‘re more interested in Star Wars as created by their peers, never mind the shaky cameras and fingers in the frame.
