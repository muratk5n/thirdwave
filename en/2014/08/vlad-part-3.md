# Vlad - Part #3
And, "coupled with sensationalism, a turbulence of emotion can be experienced which they are advised to protect against because it can easily overwhelm their minds".

Under stress they are  prone to be nebulous, dreamy, and irrational. 

Another. Attribute #281.

They have big egos, and, in an odd kind of way,  their identity rides on a sense of personal freedom. In degenerate cases they dont want to do anything others want them to do because they wont be "free" that way and their identity is stulted -in their mind- if they go along.

They question authority, tradition [fine] but paradoxically they are quite set in their ways. 

They also have a love-hate relationship with their own uniqueness. Most of the time they will be very proud of their original personalities. Other times, they feel a bit left out for being "different". So I guess the incoherent nonsense Vlad mumbles about the West can be tied to this attribute more than any other. Guy  wants to be unique, be free ... to mess up a neighboring country for example, while claiming to have a New Russia (new identity, different) which is actually Old Russia, Soviet style. He is like "treat us as if we are unique". But not too different either. It's like, understand us even when we dont know what we mean.

Errr - grow up.. or something? 

Attribute #270.

In his youth he was humbled in some way, he could not express his free will, in a direct way; the expression of their ego was thwarted, he was painfully aware of they wanted but did not always get. The biggest advice to people with #270 is three words: control your impulses. 

Brother.
