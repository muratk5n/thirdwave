# Peak Vinyl

Link

This year is the first time that more than a million vinyl albums have
been sold since 1996. This was based on Official Charts data released
by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), going back to 1994, which
was when they started keeping count.

There was nothing particularly wrong with the figures, except that
1994 is quite a bad year to start looking at vinyl, as the graph
[below] shows.

Similar arguments are made about the price of oil, looking at only few years of data. Ppl keep calling curr price cheap -- price was~$30 during  90s, now it is over $70. When price reaches $200/barrel there will not be a globalization as we know it / as the term was  coined during 90s. And we are either at or past peak according to our calculations.
