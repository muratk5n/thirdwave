# Open Loop University

At Stanford, where I teach, an idea still in the concept phase
developed by a student-led team in the university’s Hasso Plattner
Institute of Design calls for the replacement of four consecutive
college years in young adulthood with multiple residencies distributed
over a lifetime. What the designers call Open Loop University would
grant students admitted to Stanford multiple years to spend on campus,
along with advisers to help them time those years strategically in
light of their personal development and career ambitions. Today’s
arbitrarily segregated world of teenagers and young adults would
become an ever-replenished intergenerational community of purposeful
learners.This utopian ideal is admittedly quite a distance from the
institutional arrangements we have inherited, which encourage the
nation’s most privileged young people to enter and finish college by
the ripe old age of 22. But the status quo is not
sustainable. Unrelenting demand for better-educated workers, rapidly
developing technological capacity to support learning digitally and
the soaring costs of conventional campus life are driving us toward
substantial change.
