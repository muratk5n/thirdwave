# Not So Loony After All

[A]s you read this, some 75 [solar powered] Google balloons are
 airborne, hovering somewhere over the far reaches of the Southern
 Hemisphere, automatically adjusting their altitudes according to
 complex algorithms in order to catch wind currents that will keep
 them on course. By next year, Google believes it will be able to
 create a continuous, 50-mile-wide ring of Internet service around the
 globe. And by 2016, Project Loon director Mike Cassidy anticipates
 the first customers in rural South America, Southern Africa, or
 Oceania will be able to sign up for cellular LTE service provided by
 Google balloons.

Great news, both for of access in areas with no Internet, but also for
competition in areas where there are already companies "serving"
customers.
