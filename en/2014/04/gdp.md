# #GDP

Continuing from here: Andreessen says "What would have been the cost
to a consumer of the equivalent to access to Google 20 years ago? And
how is that accounted for in economic statistics such as GDP,
productivity, and income levels?". The problems dont just end
there.. Some activities, not even related to software, contribute to
economy in a major way but not measured properly. This viral video
started by a greeting card company makes the point clear. A mock
interviewer (who is actually an actor) describes an open position to
unsuspecting interviewees - this role would require them to work
continuously throughout the year without any breaks, the pay is zilch
and the workload will increase during holidays such as Christmas and
New Year. As for qualification, the candidate should be able to
multitask and should be equipped with crisis management skills. The
joke is that this is exactly the job description of a mother. It was
hilarious to watch the responses of the candidates; one actually said
the role described is "inhumane and insane". I lost it there.

Anyway - so we all know the unmeasured effect of tech things, i.e. the
immense reach and influence of open source (this fact is clearer now I
assume after the heartbleed bug). How about the contribution of a
mother to an economy? Or parents in general?
