# @Conversnitch

Meet Kyle McDonald and Brian House: They’re an artist duo who put
Wi-Fi-enabled recording devices in lamps, and installed them in a
McDonalds, a library, Washington Square Park and a private
bedroom. For seven months the lamps picked up and recorded
conversations, which were subsequently sent to Mechanical Turk
workers, who transcribed the conversations and posted them to the
twitter feed @Conversnitch. Wired broke the story this morning, and
the two artists released a video, which can be viewed below:

Watching the video or scrolling through the Twitter feed leaves one
feeling disturbingly exposed and violated — especially in a city where
small apartments mean much of some New Yorkers’ lives are lived in the
public sphere. This feeling of unease was the aim of the project, with
the express goal of making the public think more about the NSA and
mass surveillance.
