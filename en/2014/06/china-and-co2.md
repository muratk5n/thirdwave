# China and CO2

China, the world's biggest emitter of climate-changing greenhouse
gases, will set an absolute cap on its CO2 emissions from 2016, a top
government adviser said on Tuesday.Â  The target will be written into
China's next five-year plan, which comes into force in 2016, He
Jiankun, chairman of China's Advisory Committee on Climate Change,
told a conference in Beijing."The government will use two ways to
control CO2 emissions in the next five-year plan, by intensity and an
absolute cap," he said. The move will be the first time China puts
absolute limits on its CO2 emissions, which have soared 50 percent
since 2005.
