# UKIP: White face, blue collar, grey hair

Nigel Farage's core voters are not EU-obsessed Tories, but
working-class men [..]. To truly understand Ukip's appeal you need to
go much deeper.  The roots of this revolt can be traced back over
decades. Divides in the social and economic experiences of voters have
appeared, their values and priorities have been widening, and a new
electorate of "left behind" voters has grown up. These voters are on
the wrong side of social change, are struggling on stagnant incomes,
feel threatened by the way their communities and country are changing,
and are furious at an established politics that appears not to
understand or even care about their concerns. And it is these
left-behind voters who have finally found a voice in Farage's revolt.

Farage is no catch-all populist; his appeal is concentrated in
 specific groups and is utterly alien to others. Ukip has virtually no
 support among the financially secure and the thirty- and
 fortysomething university graduates who dominate politics and the
 media. Support is weak among women, white-collar professionals and
 the young. Ethnic-minority voters shun the party totally.

[..T]his is a revolt dominated by white faces, blue collars and grey
hair: angry, old, white working-class men who left school at the
earliest opportunity and lack the qualifications to get ahead in
21st-century Britain.
