# Heavy patent litigation scared off about $22 billion in VC funding over 5 years

Turns out there is a very real, and very negative, correlation between
patent troll lawsuits and the venture capital funding that startups
rely on. A just-released study by Catherine Tucker, a professor of
marketing at MIT's Sloan School of Business, finds that over the last
five years, VC investment "would have likely been $21.772 billion
higher... but for litigation brought by frequent litigators."
