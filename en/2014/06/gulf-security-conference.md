# Gulf Security Conference

What America could meaningfully do in the Middle East, with its unique
diplomatic convening power, is to support the creation of a genuine
regional security order, one that outlasts America’s commitments in
the region (which should decrease commensurate with the ebbing of its
reliance on Mideast energy supply) and remains robust in the face of
Chinese encroachment. This would require bringing Turkey, Iran, Saudi
Arabia, and Israel into the same institutional fold.This proposal,
known presently as the “Gulf Security Conference”, has been widely
discussed in inter-governmental fora such as the IISS Manama
Dialogue. It has never been taken seriously by U.S. officials,
however, on the grounds that neither Israel nor the Arabs trust
Iran. But the time for these neighbors to pretend they inhabit
different continents has passed. “Balancing” Iran has been code for
attempting to freeze time, yet it has merely meant wasting it—decades
of it. No state should rely permanently on America as a crutch, nor
should America endlessly drain its treasury in the name of an offshore
balancing policy that incentivizes belligerence. Geography is still
destiny. These four regional anchors should be urged to encourage
organic bridges to form across the region [..] But they won’t do it
without American prodding.

This is a good idea.
