The hilariously named "Commission on the Theft of American
 Intellectual Property" has finally released its report, an 84-page
 tome that's pretty bonkers. But amidst all that crazy, there's a bit
 that stands out as particularly insane: a proposal to legalize the
 use of malware in order to punish people believed to be copying
 illegally. The report proposes that software would be loaded on
 computers that would somehow figure out if you were a pirate, and if
 you were, it would lock your computer up and take all your files
 hostage until you call the police and confess your crime. This is the
 mechanism that crooks use when they deploy ransomware.

It's just more evidence that copyright enforcers' network strategies
 are indistinguishable from those used by dictators and criminals.
