# Class Of 2013 Student Debt Reaches New Heights

In what is now an annual ritual, a new crop of college graduates has
been crowned the most indebted class in American history.

Students in the class of 2013 graduated with an average debt load of
$30,000, according to an analysis by Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of
FinAid.org. Adjusted for inflation, that's roughly double the average
amount of debt students graduated with 20 years ago [..].

Outstanding student loan balances increased to a total of $986 billion
as of March 31, the New York Fed reported. Total student debt nearly
tripled over the past 8 years.

So let me try to understand this: Student debt breaks records every year.

College tuitions are rising.

Median income is flat.

At the same time, hi-tech employers cannot find enough qualified workers.

Is there anything, anything wrong with this picture?
