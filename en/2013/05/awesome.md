Two years ago, PayPal founder and libertarian futurist Peter Thiel
declared higher education "a bubble" [..] this Yearâ€™s Thiel Fellows
Include A Fashion Designer, A Poet, And A Harvard Dropout. The 22
teens were awarded $100,000 each to quit school and start a business.

Go Peter Thiel, WooHoo! :) Seriously - organized education, just as
organized crime needs to be battled with at every turn. The old system
fails to deliver quality or quantity -in the Web scale-, is too
syncronized to a time, to a place which makes it almost useless in the
post-industrial world where education and learning needs to be
continuous.
