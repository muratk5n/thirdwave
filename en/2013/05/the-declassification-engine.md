# The Declassification Engine

A group of historians, computer scientists, and statisticians at Columbia University is trying to [.. build] The Declassification Engine. This groundbreaking partnership aims to create an intelligent virtual archive of our nation’s former secrets.

The Declassification Engine discovers patterns in 
government documents and cables using natural language processing and 
machine learning [..]. There are plenty of [..] useful things we can do 
when we have a huge archive of declassified textual data to work from. 
One of the coolest: we believe we’ll be able to predict the content of 
blacked-out, redacted text in declassified documents. We can literally 
put the secrets back in, and even identify anonymous authors.
