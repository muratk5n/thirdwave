# Reproducible Science

We talked about ipython notebooks here. The technology allows markup,
math formulas and live code to be transmitted / published. As most
science relies on numeric analysis these days, a medium that allows
such authoring / editing offers a huge advantage. The recipient of a
notebook can rerun the code whose data can be pulled from any URL on
the net.

With the help of notebooks, snafus like this one can become less
likely.
