# Do the Massacres in Bayda and Banyas Portend Ethnic Cleansing to Create an Alawite State?

This question is taken up in two thoughtful articles by Hassan Hassan 
and Michael Young. Hassan Hassan argues that “sectarian cleansing is not
 being conducted for the purpose of establishing a potential state, but 
rather for other strategic purposes, including recruitment of Alawi 
fighters, deepening sectarian tensions in Assad’s favor, and ensuring a 
popular base of support,” (see Elizabeth O’Bagy). Michael Young sees 
them as a possible prelude to what may be coming if the Alawites begin 
to lose, but for the time being, he suggests that “ethnic cleansing” may
 not have been the intended result, but the massacres did serve as a 
shot across the bow of the Sunni population of the coast.

Turkey’s Foreign Minister Davutoglu claimed that Syria’s army has
begun ethnically cleansing Banyas because it is losing elsewhere in
the country. But Assad’s forces are not losing. According to both Liz
Sly of the Washington Post and Reuters reports Assad’s forces are
gaining ground in Syria, at least for the time being. This can only be
cold comfort to the Sunnis along the coast who speak of their fear of
ethnic cleansing.

The fighting in al-Bayda began when a bus carrying pro-regime 
militants, or Shabiha, was attacked, by rebel militiamen, killing at 
least seven and wounding more than 30, according to activists quoted by 
DPA. After the rebels attacked a bus, the village became “the scene of 
fierce fighting between the army and rebel battalions.” The brutality of
 the shabiha revenge on both al-Bayda and Banyas was depicted in a 
series of photos and videos that even by the standards of this war were 
shocking. The religious passions that have now colored every aspect of 
this fight ran out of control.

How likely is ethnic cleansing along the coast?

The likelihood of ethnic cleansing in the coastal regions is high. It 
will rise even higher should Assad’s troops begin to lose. The Sunni 
populations of the coastal cities will be the first to be targeted by 
Assad’s military, if it is pushed out of Damascus. Should the Alawites 
be compelled to fall back to the predominantly Alawite region of the 
mountains stretching along the western seaboard of Syria, the Sunnis of 
the coastal cities and eastern plan will be the first to suffer. Should 
Sunni militias, which are perched only kilometers from Latakia, 
penetrate to the city itself, Alawites may turn against the region’s 
Sunnis fearing that they become a fifth column. There are many 
precedents for this sort of defensive ethnic cleansing in the region. 
Zionist forces in Israel, cleared Palestinian villages of their 
inhabitants in 1948, rather than leave them behind Israeli lines. 
Armenians were driven out of Eastern Anatolia by Turks and Kurds, who 
claimed self-defense in their struggle against Russia in WWI. The Greek 
Orthodox Anatolians were driven out of Anatolia following the defeat of 
Greek forces which sought to conquer Anatolia in the early 1920s in an 
effort to resurrect the Byzantine Empire [..].

Ethnic cleansing may turn against the Alawites, as easily as it may
against Sunnis. If Sunni militias win in their struggle against the
regime and penetrate into the Alawite Mountains, Alawites will flee
before them, rather than be vanquished [..]

Western policy planners have gamed out these possibilities, making
them reluctant to arm rebel militias for a total victory. Although
opposition leaders plead for more and better weapons to bring them a
speedy victory, Western leaders have held back. The fear that three
million Alawites could flee into Lebanon, destabilizing the country
for decades, undoubtedly plays a role in Western reticence.  This sort
of population transfer could be as disruptive to the region, as was
the expulsion of Palestinians in 1948. Just as the Palestinians have
not been permitted to return to their ancestral land, neither, in all
probability, would the Alawites.
