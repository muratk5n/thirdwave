# Trouble in Paradise

It is crucial that we don’t see the Turkish protests merely as a
 secular civil society rising up against an authoritarian Islamist
 regime supported by a silent Muslim majority. What complicates the
 picture is the protests’ anti-capitalist thrust: protesters
 intuitively sense that free-market fundamentalism and fundamentalist
 Islam [..]

You don't know what  you are talking about

.. And this guy is supposed to be the preeminent philosopher of this age? Dude.  

Yes - like we were  saying, Sjeoijaoij Ziekajlsdi does not know what the hell is going on. The shitstorm in Turkey started with the Reyhanli attack, and AK with its infinite wisdom on dealing with such matters "tactically", tried to "change the topic". The insect calculation says "if you do some obnoxious stuff over here, people will forget that other garganteous misstep you made over there". It almost  worked, if it werent for the plans to abolish Gezi Park. But because of Gezi Park, now you have an actual act, a physical misstep this time, with its imp level idioacy all in plain sight, taking place live. This is not bunch of useless barking, and farting on some delusional view of the Ottomans, or harmless alcohol regulation. This is green being destroyed. AK missed this point entirely and overplayed its hand [1]. People are smart enough to distinquish between the talk, and the act. They dont care much about the idiot in the corner mumbling to himself, talking crazy shit. They do care about when the idiot starts shitting on everyone's front porch. 

Of course, the backdrop, zeitgeist needs to be mentioned, the mechanics of the protests, and the sensibilities of the people, is in synch with the 3rd Wave. In both cases the main ingredient is post-modern frame-of-mind, hi-tech vs. the old-tech and old institutions. Representative system (not democracy -and certainly not in Turkey-) is creating more problems than it can solve.

Capitalism, only as it relates to industrialism is a factor here, nothing more. People taking role in protests might not have the right words to express these things,  it's the job of the analyst to figure out what really went wrong. The root cause, if you can see it, is something that has been steadily increasing with time, and it is systemic.

One more thing: 

Because so many people equated the recent protestors with generation of 68, I did some checking. Our statistical tool lets us to look at certain profile attributes of entire generations as well as individuals, and yes, Gen68 had a lot of rebellious attributes, so much so that it can be seen directly in their profile at specific items.

The Gen2013 however has no such marker in their profile. I repeat - no such energy is present with these kids. 

That actually spells more  trouble for The Integrators. What that means is that the protests cannot be chalked to some "inherent energy" that is part of the generations make-up and would have found itself a channel it only happened to find this one. No such luck. These kids are quite normal, and, pissed off by what they see around them. By the same token, since the "disturbance" is not emenating from within, they will not go through the self-reflection, and sometimes the reversals the 68ers lived through.

[1] The point of the polemic is that it has to be / sound obnoxious,
rubbing certain people off the wrong the way, in the right
direction. But Gezi went beyond that, was an actual act, became the
last drop that brought all the other stupidity in focus. The rest is
snowball effect (more insect calculation) through police brutality.
