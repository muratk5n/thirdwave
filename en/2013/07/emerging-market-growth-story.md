# Emerging market growth story

An uncomfortable truth is making itself felt around the world of emerging market investors: the emerging market growth story is dead. 

This is not to say that emerging economies will no longer grow. Nor even that emerging market assets will no longer deliver attractive returns. But the days are long gone when “emerging markets” could be seen as a single asset class [..].

Mr Lubin says the recent street protests in Turkey, Brazil and elsewhere show that growth in those economies can no longer keep pace with popular aspirations that were raised during periods of rapid growth before and after the 2008-09 crisis.
