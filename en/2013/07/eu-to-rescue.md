# EU To The Rescue

Has Europe just discovered a previously unused muscle that can be flexed a little in the interest of Middle East peace? The leaking of European Union guidelines barring E.U. support for projects based in [Israeli] occupied territories has generated high political drama [..].

Most significantly, however, the reaction suggests that both supporters and opponents of Israeli policies believe the Europeans might be on to something — namely that the lack of consequences for Israel has been a key enabler of the ongoing occupation and denial of Palestinian rights [..].  Far from derailing peace, Europe’s move [one day] might be remembered for its contribution to resuscitating the two-state project.

The EU has done a great thing here, congradulations. As the final arbiter in most regulations, is the EU becoming the arbiter of political legitimacy now as well? Very interesting.
