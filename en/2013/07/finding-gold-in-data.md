# Finding Gold in Data

Interesting talk: So this gentleman (along with his team) won top prize in a data analysis contest; trying to predict existence of whales from few seconds of audio. Few interesting things happen here - first of all, Kridler (the winner) tries to access some academic work related to the subject, but is blocked by paywalls. Then he basically says "f--k domain knowledge" and uses data as is, extracts some key features, and runs machine learning algorithms on it. The result: detection model accuracy jumps from 72% to 98%, where the former number belongs to existing / older models. More interesting point is, existing models were surpassed within the first few days of the challenge. Oh, and Kridler does not even make use of basic audio processing / speech recognition research. This is where a lot of success in data mining comes from - just communicate with your data, create features, tune your model (beware of overfitting however), turn the crank, and iterate.
