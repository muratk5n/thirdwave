# The Seven Lesson Schoolteacher

Call me Mr. Gatto, please. Twenty-six years ago, having nothing better to do at the time, I tried my hand at schoolteaching. The license I hold certifies that I am an instructor of English language and English literature, but that isn't what I do at all. I don't teach English, I teach school -- and I win awards doing it.

Teaching means different things in different places, but seven lessons are universally taught from Harlem to Hollywood Hills [..]

1. CONFUSION: [..] The first lesson I teach is confusion. Everything I teach is out of context. I teach the un-relating of everything. I teach disconnections. I teach too much: the orbiting of planets, the law of large numbers, slavery, adjectives [..] What do any of these things have to do with each other? [..]

The logic of the school-mind is that it is better to leave school with a tool kit of superficial jargon derived from economics, sociology, natural science and so on than to leave with one genuine enthusiasm.

2. CLASS POSITION: The second lesson I teach is class position. I teach that students must stay in the class where they belong. I don't know who decides my kids belong there but that's not my business. The children are numbered so that if any get away they can be returned to the right class [..]

3. INDIFFERENCE: The third lesson I teach kids is indifference. I teach children not to care about anything too much, even though they want to make it appear that they do. How I do this is very subtle. I do it by demanding that they become totally involved in my lessons, jumping up and down in their seats with anticipation, competing vigorously with each other for my favor. It's heartwarming when they do that; it impresses everyone, even me. When I'm at my best I plan lessons very carefully in order to produce this show of enthusiasm. But when the bell rings I insist that they stop whatever it is that we've been working on and proceed quickly to the next work station. They must turn on and off like a light switch. [..]

4. EMOTIONAL DEPENDENCY: The fourth lesson I teach is emotional dependency. By stars and red checks, smiles and frowns, prizes, honors and disgraces I teach kids to surrender their will to the predestined chain of command [..]

5. INTELLECTUAL DEPENDENCY: The fifth lesson I teach is intellectual  dependency. Good people wait for a teacher to tell them what to do. It is the most important lesson, that we must wait for other people, better trained than ourselves, to make the meanings of our lives. The expert makes all the important choices; only I, the teacher, can determine what you must study, or rather, only the people who pay me can make those decisions which I then enforce [..] Successful children do the thinking I appoint them with a minimum of resistance and a decent show of enthusiasm [..]. Good people wait for an expert to tell them what to do. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that our entire economy depends upon this lesson being learned.

6. PROVISIONAL SELF-ESTEEM: [..Y]ou know how impossible it is to make self-confident spirits conform. Our world wouldn't survive a flood of confident people very long, so I teach that your self-respect should depend on expert opinion. My kids are constantly evaluated and judged. A monthly report, impressive in its provision, is sent into students' homes to signal approval or to mark exactly, down to a single percentage point, how dissatisfied with their children parents should be.

7. ONE CAN'T HIDE: The seventh lesson I teach is that one can't hide. I teach children they are always watched, that each is under constant surveillance by myself and my colleagues. There are no private spaces for children, there is no private time [..].

The current debate about whether we should have a national curriculum is phony. We already have a national curriculum locked up in the seven 
lessons I  have just outlined. Such a curriculum produces physical, 
moral, and intellectual paralysis, and no curriculum of content will be 
sufficient to reverse its hideous effects. What is currently under 
discussion in our national school hysteria about failing academic 
performance misses the point. Schools teach exactly what they are 
intended to teach and they do it well: how to be a good Egyptian and 
remain in your place in the pyramid.
