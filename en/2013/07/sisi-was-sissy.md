# Sisi Was a Sissy

One more thing: the Egyptian military (and its leader al-Sisi) must have been scared shitless about the Tahrir II protests - they did try to work with Morsi after all (they had to because of Tahrir I), but when 14 million people filled the streets protesting against the government, it must have dawned on them that would also indirectly put them in the line of sight of the crowd. So besides the powerplay, perhaps more than that, they must have felt a strong urge to say "I am not with stupid anymore" and dropped Morsi like a hot potato. The alternative would be trying to defend him.. but for what? Then as a consequence fight millions on the street? Instead they took the easy option.

So this is a coup unlikely any other - if it is that at all.
