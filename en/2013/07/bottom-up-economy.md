# Bottom Up Economy

At Homebrew we believe in a Bottom Up Economy, the idea that technology is now helping individuals and small businesses drive economic growth and innovation.  For many decades, the cost, complexity and rigidity of technology limited its power and benefits to large corporations - a Top Down Economy.

Today, we’re in the midst of a transformation where technology is increasingly accessible enough, cheap enough and flexible enough to empower individuals and small teams. Teams of 5, 50 or 500 can compete with organizations tens or hundreds of times their size or create entirely new markets with innovative products and services. The Bottom Up Economy.

The Bottom Up Era

Opportunity and necessity are powerful forces on their own, but when paired together they are undeniably potent.  Opportunity is created by several catalysts driving a Bottom Up Economy:

- Supercomputer in Our Hands: For the 2.5 billion people already online, smartphones, tablets and other increasingly inexpensive internet-connected devices have been magical, but for the remaining billions getting online for the first time via these devices, they will be transformative.  As inventor Ray Kurzweil has said, “a kid in Africa has access to more information than the president of the United States did 15 years ago.”  Our bet is that the kid in Africa will use that information to become an entrepreneur…and we hope she looks us up.

- Trickle Down Technology: Enterprise technology used to be expensive to buy, complex to customize and frustrating to maintain. It was clunky and ugly compared to consumer tech.  Now APIs, cloud services and app platforms provide the opportunity for businesses large and small to benefit from unprecedented efficiencies and intelligence.
