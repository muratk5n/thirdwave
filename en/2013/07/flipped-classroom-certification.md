# Flipped Classroom Certification

This term was used by Salman Khan before - instead of "stand and deliver" style lecturing, teachers take a backseat,  kids learn at their own pace (through technology), individually, and they use the "adult in the room" only to ask questions, as well as eachother. Apparently there is a certification now for this kind of lecturing. Very cool.

Some stats - "85% of teachers whoâ€™ve flipped their classroom have seen improved grades".
