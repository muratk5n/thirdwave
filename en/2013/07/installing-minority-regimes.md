# Installing Minority Regimes

When the Western colonial powers sketched out the borders of the
Middle East after World War I, they installed minority regimes in
three states: the Maronite Christians in Lebanon, the Sunnis in Iraq,
and the Alawites in Syria. The motive behind putting minority groups
in power was to retain influence in the region, as a minority regime
would rely upon outside support from the British or the French.
