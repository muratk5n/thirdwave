# Startup Rising

Despite the world's elation at the Arab Spring, shockingly little has 
changed politically in the Middle East; even frontliners Egypt and 
Tunisia continue to suffer repression, fixed elections, and bombings, 
while Syria descends into civil war. But in the midst of it all, a 
quieter revolution has begun to emerge, one that might ultimately do 
more to change the face of the region: entrepreneurship. As a seasoned 
angel investor in emerging markets, Christopher M. Schroeder was curious
 but skeptical about the future of investing in the Arab world.  
Travelling to Dubai, Cairo, Amman, Beirut, Istanbul, and even Damascus, 
he saw thousands of talented, successful, and intrepid entrepreneurs, 
all willing to face cultural, legal, and societal impediments inherent 
to their worlds.  Equally important, he saw major private equity firms, 
venture capitalists, and tech companies like Google, Intel, Cisco, 
Yahoo, LinkedIn, and PayPal making significant bets, despite the 
uncertainty in the region. Here, he marries his own observations with 
the predictions of these tech giants to offer a surprising and timely 
look at the second stealth revolution in the Middle East—one that 
promises to reinvent it as a center of innovation and progress.
