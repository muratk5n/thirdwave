# Symbiosis

Although most academic research is funded by the public, universities
all but force their scholars to publish their results in journals that
take ownership of the work and place it behind expensive pay walls.

Centuries ago, when printing and mailing paper journals was the  most
efficient way to disseminate new knowledge, a symbiotic relationship
developed between scholars, who had ideas they wanted to share, and
publishers, who had printing presses and the means to convey printed
works to a wide audience. Transferring copyright to publishers, which
protected their ability to recover costs and profit from their
investment, was a reasonable price for authors to pay to further their
disseminating mission.

But with the birth of the internet, scholars no longer needed
publishers to distribute their work. As NYU’s Clay Shirky has noted,
publishing went from being an industry to being a button.

Had the leaders of major research universities reacted to this 
technological transformation with any kind vision, [Aaron] Swartz’s dream of 
universal free access to the scholarly literature would now be a 
reality. But they did not. Rather than seize this opportunity to greatly
 facilitate research and education, both within and outside the academy,
 they chose instead to reify the status quo.

Absurdly, as soon as the scholarly output of our universities is in the 
hands of publishers, they immediately buy it back, spending billions of 
scarce institutional dollars every year in subscription and licensing 
fees to provide access to students and faculty, but leaving everybody 
else out in the cold. 

Posting our PDFs is all fine and good, but the real way to honor Aaron 
Swartz is to combat this pervasive institutional fecklessness and do 
everything in our power to make sure no papers ever end up behind pay 
walls again. We have to demand that our universities alter their policies to reward, 
rather than punish, free scholarly publishing, and that they stop 
cutting the checks that keep this immoral system afloat.
