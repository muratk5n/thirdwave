# Aaron Schwartz on SOPA

There are some interesting observations: that Supreme Court has a
blindspot on copyright, the legal filter that works well against even
pornography does not function on copyright. United States has a
cultural tug-of-war between "containing (prohibition)"Â  and "letting
go", IMO the issue of slightly offensive content are handled / are
used to being handled through this prism. But copyright is seen as an
entirely different beast.

And I tell you why: because copyright is closely linked to the issue
of property - a concept that strikes a different chord in America.

And oddly enough the issue of property becomes crucial for the
struggle between waves - as it has once before. We all know American
Civil War, a major struggle for power between agrarian and industrial
forces, revolved around the issue slavery and at this time according
to the law of the land, black people were seen as property. Antabellum
America decided they were not, took steps to correct this shameful
mistake. Today, there is another fight, again between waves, around
yet another definition of property. Is knowledge property? How much of
it belongs to someone / anyone?
