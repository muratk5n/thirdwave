# Mathematicians aim to take publishers out of publishing

Mathematicians plan to launch a series of free open-access journals
 that will host their peer-reviewed articles on the preprint server
 arXiv.  The project was publicly revealed yesterday in a blog post by
 Tim Gowers, a Fields Medal winner and mathematician at the University
 of Cambridge, UK.

The initiative, called the Episciences Project, hopes to show that 
researchers can organize the peer review and publication of their work 
at minimal cost, without involving commercial publishers [..].

Each journal, or ‘epijournal’, would have its own editor and editorial 
board, and authors could submit their arXiv-posted papers to their 
journal of choice. The journal would then organize peer review, perhaps 
using workflow software provided by the CCSD. Peer-reviewed papers would
 be posted on arXiv alongside their un-reviewed versions [..].

Gowers has strong views on shaking up research publishing — last year, he kick-started a boycott of the Dutch publishing giant Elsevier
