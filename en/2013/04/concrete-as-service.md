# Concrete as a Service

In the first part of the nineteenth century, textile mills were the
industrial success stories. These mills sprang up in the growing towns
and cities along rivers in England and New England to harness
hydropower. Water, running over water wheels, drove spinning,
knitting, and weaving machines. For a century, the symbol of the
industrial revolution was water driving textile machines.

The business world has changed. Old mill towns are now quaint
historical curiosities. Long mill buildings alongside rivers are
warehouses, shopping malls, artist studios and computer
companies. Even manufacturing companies often provide more value in
services than in goods. We were struck by an ad campaign by a leading
international cement manufacturer, Cemex, that presented concrete as a
service. Instead of focusing on the quality of cement, its price, or
availability, the ad pictured a bridge over a river and sold the idea
that “cement” is a service that connects people by building bridges
between them. Concrete as a service? A very [postmodern] idea.

Access to electrical or mechanical power is no longer the criterion
for suc­cess.  [.. D]ata about customer interactions is the new
waterpower; knowledge drives the turbines of the service economy and,
since the line between service and  manufacturing is getting blurry,
much of the manufacturing economy as well.
