The unlimited nature of the records being handed over to the NSA is
extremely unusual [..] The order directs Verizon to "continue
production on an ongoing daily basis thereafter for the duration of
this order". It specifies that the records to be produced include
"session identifying information", such as "originating and
terminating number", the duration of each call, telephone calling card
numbers, trunk identifiers, International Mobile Subscriber Identity
(IMSI) number, and "comprehensive communication routing information".

The information is classed as "metadata", or transactional
information, rather than communications, and so does not require
individual warrants to access.

Nice 

BTW metadata does not mean transactional. Meta in this context means
"descriptive", meaning "data that describes data". For instance you
could have a file with thousand lines with one column that says
"temparature". The name of that column, temparature which is its
decription, would be metadata. It is usually expected metadata is
smaller than data itself, and changes less often, and perhaps.. less
important. The story makes much more sense this way because they are
almost trying to say "hey it's just some descriptive stuff on the side
you know, it's not thaaat important". By some word shuffling, they
managed to label the more important data as "supportive", and get
regular updates of it. Sneaky.

Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous?

It is
