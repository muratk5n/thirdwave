Matters have been not helped by the American media’s characterization
 of the Obama administration’s relative rebalancing of focus toward
 Asia as a “pivot” (a word never used by the president)

Actually it was

You are slippin old man..

With blunt instruments typically used by governments, such as this
"rebalancing" etc, can one say military matters cannot, ever be part
of the act and the message? C'mon. At least you'd ruffle some feathers
and hint some stuff.

Well - while we are at it, here are some other things that are
happening at the same time. 1) US of A, through fracking, thinks it
will be self sufficient in natural gas and oil production. 2) And
rebalances towards Asia. Then: does that mean less US involvement in
Middle East? Since US of A produces its own oil, can it now affort to
get out of ME?

Then, is ME being left to EU to "manage"? Are geographically close
regions to EU such as North Africa now officially EU backyard? Case in
point France (and German) involvement in Mali. US inaction in Syria.

Does EU want to strenghten its military involvement in this new
backyard?

Did EU ask Britain to get involved more in that effort since it has a
more experienced in such matters? Did Cameron use this opportunity to
renegotiate his relationship with EU (you need me more, you give me
more)? Is that why Turkey wants more leeway in its progress on EU
membership because it sees it would be an important stepping stone to
manage Middle East, in this brave new world?

Just brainstorming here on some strategery. In the end though, this is
all small-time stuff. Much larger forces are in play now.

But, I do agree we are in a way, in the Post-Hegemonic Age.
