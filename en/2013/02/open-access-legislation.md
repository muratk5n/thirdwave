# Open Access Legislation

Yesterday a bi-partisan group of legislatures [..] introduced
legislation that would require federal agencies that fund scientific
and medical research to make works they fund available to the
public. This bill â€“ known as the Fair Access to Science and Technology
Research Act of 2013, or FASTR, is a better version of legislation
introduced in previous Congresses.
