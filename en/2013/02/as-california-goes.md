# As California Goes?

Gov. Jerry Brown wants California’s public institutions to take a hard
look at MOOCs. Along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, he is
encouraging experimentation with MOOC platforms for introductory and
remedial courses [..].

San Jose State University on Tuesday announced a deal with Udacity, a
major MOOC player, to create a pilot program of three online,
entry-level courses that will cost students $150 to take and lead to
university-awarded academic credits if passed. San Jose State
professors will teach the courses while Udacity contributes the
platform and staff support, including mentors who will help track and
encourage students’ progress.
