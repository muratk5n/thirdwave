# Not Cool

On Monday night, NBC News’s Michael Isikoff published a Justice
Department memo justifying the “targeted killings” — without due
process — of U.S. citizens who are leaders in al-Qaeda or “associated
forces” but are “outside the area of hostile activities,” such as
Afghanistan. The document is based on a still-classified memo on
targeted killings of U.S. citizens prepared by the Justice
Department's Office of Legal Counsel.

The summary memo is a chilling document, full of twisted definitions,
gaping loopholes and hints that the White House still isn’t sharing
its full justification for killing citizens without due process.
