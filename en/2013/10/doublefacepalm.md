Azerbaijan's big presidential election, held on Wednesday, was
anticipated to be neither free nor fair [..] Even still, one expects a
certain ritual in these sorts of authoritarian elections, a fealty to
at least the appearance of democracy, if not democracy itself. So it
was a bit awkward when Azerbaijan's election authorities released vote
results â€“ a full day before voting had even started.
