# Robot Baristas

Starbucks’ 95,000 baristas have a competitor. It doesn’t need
 sleep. It’s precise in a way that a human could never be. It requires
 no training. It can’t quit. It has memorized every one of its
 customers’ orders. There’s never a line for its perfectly turned-out
 drinks. It doesn’t require health insurance. Don’t think of it as the
 enemy of baristas, insists Kevin Nater, CEO of the company that has
 produced this technological marvel. 

Oh by all means please do think of it as the enemy

But.. who cares if it is the enemy or not? Let's automate everything.
Let's destroy jobs as much as possible. It is the surest way of
bringing the end of a defunct system. Industrial system is based on
the idea that you get up, go to work (factory), send the kid to
educational factory, and buy things that are made in other factories,
by people who went to work just like you. Automation, in a scale that
is now possible through robotics and AI / machine learning strikes at
the heart of this system. Economists are going berserk over 10%
unemployment. What happens when it is 30%? Or 40%? Maybe then they
will start thinking about the economy of the future rather than the
future of the economy.
