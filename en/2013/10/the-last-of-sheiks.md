# The Last of the Sheiks?

This summer, disgruntled Saudis took their grievances online in
 droves, complaining of ever-growing inequality, rising poverty,
 corruption and unemployment. Their Twitter campaign became one of the
 world’s highest trending topics. It caused great alarm within elite
 circles in Saudi Arabia and sent ripples throughout the region. The
 rallying cry that “salaries are not enough” helped to prove that the
 monarchy’s social contract with its people is now publicly coming
 unstuck, and on a significant scale [..]

Shiites in Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia [became] victims of a
vicious sectarian strategy, as the Saudi government has sought to
persuade Sunni citizens and Western allies that they are fighting
against the proxies of a dangerous, expansionist Iran, rather than the
democratic vanguard of a popular revolt.
