# In New Poll, Americans Blame Everyone for Government Shutdown

According to the survey, 63 percent of those questioned said they were
angry at Republicans, with 57 percent also angry at Democrats, and 53
percent unhappy with President Obama [..] Those numbers are higher
than during the shutdowns of 1995-96, when President Bill Clinton and
Republicans, under then House Speaker Newt Gingrich [..] reached an
impasse over government funding. Republicans took most of the blame
during that stoppage [..]

But this time around, with President Obama receiving a much higher
share of the blame in polls — and with no end in sight — it doesn’t
look like any winner will emerge anytime soon.
