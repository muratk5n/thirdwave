So what is Heaven, and what is Hell?

That should be obvious to anyone who uses Windows, or any other
non-free software. Heaven is that state in which all knowledge is
freely available to all, and Hell is the opposite.

I dont think everything can and should be free, but we should ve
grateful a lot of things are. After all Windows would not have
Internet capability if it wasnt for the "Berkeley stack" -- which was
free.
