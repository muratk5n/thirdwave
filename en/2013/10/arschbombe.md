Oh yeaahh.. Mass media in Germany is abuzz with the latest listening
scandal. The photo above is from a tabloid newspaper B.Z., they are
saying "every morning at 10 am Bama new everything Merkel talked about
the day before". A bit sensationalized [or not] but stuff like this is
all over the place. US needs to clean up its act it seems to me.
