# In Coins We Trust

There isÂ  a downside here however; there is still the central
distributor in the middle - the government, and the entire setup would
create a psychological situation where people are waiting, hat in
hand, for their money to appear at a certain time, sent by a some
large entity.

Digital currencies can, maybe, in a way fix this problem as
well. Noone needs to give anyone money, you create it. Individuals
cannot go crazy with the creation, mining introduces an artificial
delay into the process, which is good. Side benefit: no more central
banks.

One thing I do not like in all of the current __coin schemes is this
however; I'd prefer mining to continue indefinitely, so there is
always enough __coin quota to allow people to mine. Maybe a way to do
that is introducing time limits to every coin, i.e. each one is good
for.. 10 years. So the money ages (old money!). Or there is a limit in
# of transactions that can be used for each coin (this is doable
because the coin network knows all, sees all, it knows every
transaction, and how many coins are "out there", etc). This can
disincentivize hoarding / sitting on money for a long time.
