# #hail the #fail

The knowledge society is the first human society where upward mobility
is potentially unlimited. Knowledge differs from all other means of
production in that it cannot be inherited or bequeathed. It has to be
acquired anew by every individual, and everyone starts out with the
same total ignorance [..].

The upward mobility of the knowledge society, however, comes at a high
price: the psychological pressures and emotional traumas of the rat
race. There can be winners only if there are losers. This was not true
of earlier societies.

The son of the landless laborer who became a landless labore himself
was not a failure. In the knowledge society, however, he is not only a
personal failure but a failure of society as well.
