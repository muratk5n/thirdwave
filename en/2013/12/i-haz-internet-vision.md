# I Haz Internet Vision

Clifford Stoll, 1995

After two decades online, I'm perplexed. It's not that I haven't had a
gas of a good time on the Internet. I've met great people and even
caught a hacker or two. But today, I'm uneasy about this most trendy
and oversold community. Visionaries see a future of telecommuting
workers, interactive libraries and multimedia classrooms. They speak
of electronic town meetings and virtual communities. Commerce and
business will shift from offices and malls to networks and modems. And
the freedom of digital networks will make government more
democratic. Baloney.

Ha ha

Yeah.. That dude totally ate crow on that one. What _up_!

[Because of Snowden leaks t]he suspension of relations between Australia and Indonesia, two of the most powerful nations in the region, was swift and dramatic. And the consequences of this latest leak from Mr. Snowden’s cache of documents — for politicians, asylum seekers and, possibly, journalists — have been severe.

The spying story was broken by The Guardian’s Australia edition [..] The government turned its wrath on the ABC for having exercised what Mr. Abbott called “very, very poor judgment” in working with the “left wing” Guardian, and Rupert Murdoch’s broadsheet paper, The Australian, ran a series of stories about staff wages, alleged bias and need for reform of the ABC, which it views as a competitor.

A prominent crowd of conservatives, who have long accused the ABC of having a left-wing slant, immediately began calling for it to be privatized, split in two and severely admonished [..].

It was as though the ABC, and not Mr. Snowden, was responsible for the leak.

The ABC is no stranger to attack. But it would be ironic if the work of a man determined to drag covert — potentially illegal — operations into the light were to result in the muzzling of an independent, nonpartisan broadcaster [..]

As we watched Mr. Scott being roasted here, the editor of The Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, was being grilled by a parliamentary committee in Britain — also for publishing Snowden stories — with questions like, “Do you love this country?”

Have you people gone completely mad? 

Seriously. What the frack is going on over there?
