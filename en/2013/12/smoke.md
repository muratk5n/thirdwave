# #smoke

Equivalent of 20 classrooms-full of children take up smoking every day in UK, according to research.

That's a lot

At first I thought this paper was being "sensationalist", using the image of a classroom (it's big!) and "20 of them!" to increase the effect of this number. I checked the numbers tho, and with data from this graph, if we take an annual # of births to be roughly 700,000, divide by 365, and 30 (size of class?), result is 63 classrooms worth of people born each day in UK. And if, out of that, 20 "classrooms" take up smoking, that's bad.
