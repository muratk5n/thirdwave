# Russia vs Europe

The
 world needs Nelson Mandelas. Instead, it gets Vladimir Putins. As the 
South African hero was being sung to his grave last week, the Russian 
president was bullying neighboring Ukraine into a new customs union that
 is starting to look a bit like Soviet Union Lite, and consolidating his
 control of state-run media by creating a new Kremlin news agency [..]

Ha ha ha

Uh ♫♪ I am fresh, I am fly ♪♫  Get in my Beamer, Benz or Bentley ♪♫ Wear my ring and confetti ♪♫ I am Kobe Bryant ready ♪♫  ♪♫ [yeah yeah!] I'm fresh, I'm fly ♪♫ Got your b...ch waving at me when I roll by ♪♫ Yeah yeah! Uh! That's fly.. ♪♫ My n...a my n...a.
