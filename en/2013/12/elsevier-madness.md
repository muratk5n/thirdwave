# Elsevier Madness

I thought Elsevier was already doing all it could to alienate the
 authors who freely donate their work to shore up the corporation’s
 obscene profits. The thousands of takedown notices sent to
 Academia.edu represent at best a grotesque PR mis-step, an idiot
 manoeuvre that I thought Elsevier would immediately regret and
 certainly avoid repeating.

Which just goes to show that I dramatically underestimated just how
 much Elsevier hate it when people read the research they publish, and
 the lengths they’re prepared to go to when it comes to ensuring the
 work stays unread.

Now, they’re targeting individual universities.

The University of Calgary has just sent this notice to all staff:

The University of Calgary has been contacted by a company representing
 the publisher, Elsevier Reed, regarding certain Elsevier journal
 articles posted on our publicly accessible university web pages. We
 have been provided with examples of these articles and reviewed the
 situation.  Elsevier has put the University of Calgary on notice that
 these publicly posted Elsevier journal articles are an infringement
 of Elsevier Reed’s copyright and must be taken down.  That’s it,
 folks. Elsevier have taken the gloves off.

It appears Elsevier has gone postal. Is this the mob or a company man? What the f..k?
