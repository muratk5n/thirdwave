# Futurism and Digital Currencies

Money flow is controlled by central banks. But, what if everyone had
access to technology to print their own money? That is essentially
what Bitcoin, or Litecoin are. Anyone can "print" their money through
a digital mining process.

What does printing money have to do with technology? Well, paper is
technology. Keeping track of some numbers on the paper money is
technology. When that technology "trickles down" to everyone, all of a
sudden ____ is doable by all.
