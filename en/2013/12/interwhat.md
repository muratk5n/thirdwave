# #interwhat?

The latest report, this time via Der Spiegel and based on internal NSA
documents, reveals that the NSA, in conjunction with the CIA and FBI,
has begun intercepting laptops purchased online in order to install
(quite literal) spyware and even hardware on the machines. The NSA
terms this “interdiction.” Agents divert shipments to secret
warehouses, carefully open the packages, install the software and/or
hardware, and send them on their way.
