# Iain M. Banks

So opression is worse than taking a life, not idolatry. The wrong
translation (it is claimed) comes from N. J. Dawood translation which
at one time was very popular in the West and that's probably where
I. M. Banks took it from. I am sure the way Banks uses it fits with
the rest of his novel, it completes his story, adds little "mystique",
that extra little somethin somethin .. That's fine. But the meaning
used is incorrect.

Idolatry translation conceptually makes no sense either, because after
2:190 there are some passages in Koran where it says "to fight
idolatry until it is no more".. ??? So brother's gonna look around,
see people worshipping, say, to Justin Bieber, and that is so bad
right? "Worse than carnage!" so he has to fight it until it is no
more.. That's stupid. Using the opression translation things are
clearer. People are being opressed, and that is bad (worse than being
killed? probably yes), then sure, fight it until it is no more
(depending on the nature of the opression of course, please dont go
postal).
