# Entire library journal editorial board resigns

In a dramatic show of support for the open access movement, the 
editor-in-chief and entire editorial board of the Journal of Library 
Administration announced their resignation last week.
 In a letter to contributors, the board singled out a conflict with 
owners over the journal's licensing terms, which stripped authors of 
almost all claim to ownership of their work. 

In a blog post after the resignation,
 board member Chris Bourg cited her experience of "a crisis of 
conscience about publishing in a journal that was not open access" in 
the days after the death of Aaron Swartz.
