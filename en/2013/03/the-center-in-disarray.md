# The Center in Disarray

The US court responsible for hearing patent appeals is showing fresh 
signs of disarray [..] We recently covered a decision by the [US] Court of Appeals [..] that upheld a patent on the idea of using a computer to perform a particular kind of financial transaction. Now, just a couple of weeks later, the same court has reached the opposite conclusion about a patent on using a computer to manage a particular type of life insurance policy.
