# Conservative Artisan

Is it possible for an Artisan, particularly an STP to be conservative? This sounds plausible. We said that Ti can conceptualize, but, at the same time, Se can force STPs to take "the current state of things" as granted, Ti having to work through in-the-moment Se was a major cause for this, etc. But what are the mechanics?

IMO, it is useful to think of STPs as the hunter / sports type, say chasing a pray in the woods.

This person needs to move fast. Then, conceptual determinations projected to physical world are colored with "what is  immovable", and "what  I can run over". This semi-conceptual framework is needed to be able to quickly make tactical decisions while moving fast. A big rock, a big tree is immovable - you have to run around them. In comparison, a fig leaf is weak, you just run over it. 

If no constant sensor data is available, then you seek immovables, but still some form of pysical presence is preferred. A famous person XYZ (big man) can be such immovable, or "groups" of physical peoples. After all these are things you  can see. In the absence of that, other perceived unchanging "things" can become immovables, such as an important state (a superpower XYZ "so big, so important!"), or more interestingly, history itself (it's always been there!). If historic artifacts are visible all around, this could, in theory, could increase its effect. 

This is how we make sense an Artisan writer, or politician combating with various things around him. Sticking to history, to a defunct system is due to its perceived "unchanging" status can be expected, ditto for cozying up (or simply expecting they will always exist) to various powers because they are just "there". Meanwhile characters loom large, some of who are immovable solids, others, such as a journalist, can be a fig leaf, a thing you can simply run over. The fact that this journalist could be part of a process, a continuation of something logical, and normal, perhaps part of a slow trend whose bashing can cause backlash can completely be missed by an STP. 

Like I said, these are all pshychological preferences, nothing biological, and certainly not categorically good or bad. Some preferences are excellent at certain things, and not on others. This is all fine. That's why diversity is important.
