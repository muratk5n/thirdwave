# Tablets in Wonchi

In the Ethiopian [village] Wonchi there are no street signs. But
[there are] tablet PCs. U.S. researchers [are testing] here whether
computers can replace teachers. And if the world of digital divide can
be overcome. Abebech is one of 20 children in the remote Ethiopian
village Wonchi [where they are] teach[ing] with modern computers and
learning without a teacher.
