# Damon Saz

Actor Matt Damon says he feels like [..] “[Obama] broke up with me,”
Damon told BET in an interview published on Thursday. The star,
formerly a big supporter of the president, charged that Obama has
“some explaining to do” for his actions in the White House.

“There are a lot of things that I really question – the legality of
the drone strikes, these NSA revelations. Jimmy Carter came out and
said we don’t live in a democracy. That’s a little  intense when an
ex-president says that.”

Damn. Did not know Carter was against the NSA "overreach".
