# Did Assad Do it?

It is unlikely that the decision makers of Baath and Assad family are responsible for using WMD, for an obvious reason: they would have to be insanely stupid to even think about it. But sure someone from Syrian "government" (at lower ranks) could do this with some "external" influence, then the entire Syrian ruling elite ends up being responsible (not that I dont support Assad's removal from power btw).
