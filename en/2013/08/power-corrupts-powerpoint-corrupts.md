# Power Corrupts. PowerPoint Corrupts Absolutely.

[S]lideware -computer programs for presentations -is everywhere: in
corporate America, in government bureaucracies [..]. Particularly

schools. Rather than learning to write a report using sentences,
children are being taught how to formulate client pitches and
infomercials.
