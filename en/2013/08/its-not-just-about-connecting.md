# It's Not Just About Connecting

What does this mean? This means people can perform a lot of local
computation and reap the benefits, locally. All of this reduces the
need to rely on a center. Education + entertainment benefits are
enormous.

Computer games are a good example: recently gaming industry became
bigger than Holywood, meaning the narrative, graphics generated on a
local computer supported by AI gets more attention now than some
one-way, non-interactive play of light projected on a screen. Your
kid, when he goes to his room,Â  might be commanding armies, creating
societies, learning tactics, strategy on these computer games, in his
spare time. These strategy games are no joke - I've seen kids dealing
with logistical, strategical issues across galaxies, centuries that
would give a real-life strategist a hard time.

Marshall McLuhan said, "we shape our tools, then our tools shape
us". There is an astonishing interplay between man and machine which
is already creating a new breed of person who has different wants,
priorities, sensibilities than a factory worker from the 50s.
