# Landis on Chemical Weapons and Syria

In response to question: If it is Determined that the Assad Regime Used Chemical Weapons Against Civilians, Should the United States and its Allies Attack Syria?

The US must respond to the use of chemical weapons in a forceful manner, but should not launch a broader intervention in Syria. Preserving the widely respected international norm banning the use of chemical weapons is a clear interest of the US and international community. 

The US, however, should avoid getting sucked into the Syrian Civil War. Thus, it should punish Assad with enough force to deter future use of chemical weapons, but without using so much force that it gets drawn into an open-ended conflict.

The reasons why the US should avoid a wider intervention is that it has no partner within Syria or the international community to help shoulder the burden of nation-building.  All the countries of the region want Washington to solve their Syria problem, but none want to send in troops.

The Syrian opposition is dysfunctional and composed of over 1,000 militias, the strongest of which are radically pro-Islamist and virulently anti-American. Most are not prepared to work with the US or provide responsible government for the country.

The barbarism of the Assad regime is horrifying, but the US cannot solve the bitter ethnic, sectarian, and factional rivalries in Syria. It should, however, attempt to dissuade Assad from using chemical weapons, and can employ force in this endeavor [..].

While the U.S. and the American people are no allies of the Syrian 
regime (and for good reason), pushing hard for a rebel win today is not 
in US interests and is unlikely to benefit Syria. Punitive measures 
taken against the regime following the use of chemical weapons should be
 conducted with the purpose of deterring the future use of chemical 
weapons—not to change the balance of power in favor of the rebels.

This is said with full recognition of the terrible atrocities and 
killing taking place within Syria, including the many crimes of the 
regime. The Assad regime is not an entity to be protected or defended, 
but destroying it today may throw the country into greater chaos and 
suffering and pull the U.S. into a morass that lacks any visible 
solution.

Interesting.. Let's see if US acts along the lines described above.. The thing is though, any kind of US attack on Syrian regime will provide the opposition a morale boost, it can trigger a unification of sorts.
