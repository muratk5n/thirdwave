# Dispatch From The Future: Uber To Purchase 2,500 Driverless Cars From Google

As part of its second-quarter earnings announcement today, local
transportation and delivery giant Uber announced its biggest bet on
autonomous vehicles yet, saying it would purchase 2,500 driverless
cars from Google [..]

While the company has experimented with the use of autonomous cars as
part of its fleet, those cars still needed an Uber “driver” present in
case of an emergency. However, since the GX3200 has been licensed for
commercial use in several states — such as California, New York,
Illinois, and Washington — Uber will be able to deploy the cars
without drivers in several of its largest markets.
