# Interregnum

In his Prison Notebooks, Antonio Gramsci wrote: “The crisis consists precisely in the fact that the old is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.” [..]

[America scales back, Russia acts as a spoiler]. Neither China nor India shows much interest for now in new organizing principles for the world.

Perhaps, those principles are now defined by technology, social networks and individual empowerment, forces that lie outside conventional notions of geostrategic power. But this is just another way of saying that the world’s current interregnum is little understood. 

True

Wikipedia: "An interregnum (plural interregna or interregnums) is a period of discontinuity or "gap" in a government, organization, or social order". These are simply the new unknowns appearing because of the  3rd Wave. The elements listed, technology, social networks and individual empowerment are the base elements, the core of the new age. Anything incompatible with these new forces will have trouble staying afloat.
