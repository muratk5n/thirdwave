# Frame 313

For three decades, people thought the best proof of foul play was a
27-second home movie of the assassination taken by a Dallas
dressmaker, Abraham Zapruder. It shows JFK’s head being blasted
backwards and to his left [..] But the U.S. Government insisted that
JFK was shot by just one man hiding in a building far behind the
limousine.

Lifton was a graduate in engineering physics. He took the
black-and-white copies of the Zapruder film frames, published by the
U.S. Government, to Nobel-prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. He
thought that Feynman would conclude, from the laws of physics, that
the shot must have come from the front.

Lifton was dismayed when Feynman ignored all of the frames except the
ones that show the President just before and just after the impact of
the shot: [..] Feynman found that JFK’s head moved forwards at the
moment of impact.

Feynman again! 

Lone gunman then heh? No conspiracy?
