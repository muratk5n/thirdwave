# Innovation Imperative

WHEN the first commercially successful steamship traveled the Hudson
River in 1807, it didn’t appear to be much of a competitive threat to
transoceanic sailing ships [..] so steam power gained its foothold as
a “disruptive innovation” in inland waterways, where the ability to
move against the wind, or when there was no wind at all, was
important. In 1819, the technology vastly improved, the S.S. Savannah
made the first Atlantic crossing powered by steam and sail (in truth,
only 80 of the 633-hour voyage was by steam). Sailing ship companies
didn’t completely ignore the advancement. They built hybrid ships,
adding steam engines to their sailing vessels, but never entered the
pure steamship market.

Ultimately, they paid the price for this decision. By the early 1900s,
with steam able to power a ship across the ocean on its own, and do so
faster than the wind, customers migrated to steamships. Every single
transoceanic sailing-ship company went out of business.Traditional
colleges are currently on their hybrid voyage across the ocean.Like
steam, online education is a disruptive innovation — one that
introduces more convenient and affordable products or services that
over time transform sectors. Yet many bricks-and-mortar colleges are
making the same mistake as the once-dominant tall ships: they offer
online courses but are not changing the existing model.
