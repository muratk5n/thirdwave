# Google’s Boss and a Princeton Professor Agree: College Is a Dinosaur

Colleges and universities are [..] vulnerable to losing their best
teachers to the Internet.That’s the shared view of Google (GOOG)
Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt and Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former
Department of State official and until this month a tenured professor
at Princeton University [..]Schmidt was more positive about the
un-Princeton-like Khan Academy, on whose board he serves. He said the
academy, which offers free online video tutorials on dozens of topics,
has begun to analyze students’ answers to figure out which questions
do the best job of assessing mastery of a topic.The Google boss also
had kind words for EdX, a nonprofit created by Harvard University and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that lets students take
“interesting, fun, and rigorous courses” for free. Google and EdX
announced this week that the tech giant will host a platform called
Open EdX in a bid to make it easier for anyone to create online
courses. “The fun will start,” Schmidt said, as new ventures smash up
against incumbents that resist change.Slaughter agreed that
traditional colleges and universities, with their high fixed costs,
are at risk. “They’re going to lose their top talent,” she said. “We
can become global teachers. The best people can become free agents.”
