# Putin Profile

U.S. officials haven't found it easy to get a handle on Mr. Putin or his motivations. While anti-Americanism has been a key theme for Mr. Putin, the U.S. expected he would dial back the rhetoric once he had cemented control after the 2012 elections, a prediction that proved unfounded.

Mr. Obama's attempts to make a personal connection, such as complimenting Mr. Putin's judo skills during their last meeting, have fallen flat. Offhand comments, such as Mr. Obama's recent comparison of Mr. Putin to a "bored kid at the back of the classroom," rankled in Moscow.

The Central Intelligence Agency's classified personality profile of Mr. Putin, prepared by the agency for Mr. Obama and other policy makers, says he was bullied in his youth. It also describes Mr. Putin as insecure, according to American officials who have read it.
