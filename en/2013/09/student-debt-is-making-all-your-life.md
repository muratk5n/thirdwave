# Student Debt Is Making All Your Life Choices Worse

Surprise: student debt is having a depressing effect on Americans' life choices. According
 to a new report from the Boston-based nonprofit American Student 
Assistance, a quarter of college students said their student loans made 
it difficult to buy daily necessities, and nearly two-thirds said their 
debt prevented them from making large purchases, like buying a car.

In addition to this drag on lifestyle and consumer spending, student
 debt also played a significant role in larger financial and personal
 commitments. Three-fourths of respondents said they put off saving
 for retirement or buying a home because of their debt. Almost
 one-third delayed marriage and 43 percent waited to start a family.
