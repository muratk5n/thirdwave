A [..] story tells of a delegation of sailors who went to the tribunal
of the Inquisition in the seventeenth century, when the Catholic
Church had forbidden the use of Galileo's astronomy as an affront to
the Bible's account of creation. The sailors sheepishly confessed that
Galileo's theory had both simplified their journeys and made their
maps more accurate. They hoped that the Inquisitors would exempt
mariners from the church's proscription against it. The Tribunal
considered the problem, consulted with the bishops, and sent an
emissary to the Pope. Finally, they conceded. They said, "OK, if the
theory works, use it. But don't believe it".
