# Who Failed?

[W]e also need to acknowledge something fundamental: President
Obama’s  policy toward Syria has failed, and it’s time to try a
tougher approach.

Obama reportedly rejected a proposal from Hillary Clinton and David
Petraeus to arm rebels in Syria, because he feared getting dragged
into the conflict. Now we’re getting dragged in anyway, and everything
we worried about has come to pass:

The war has spread and destabilized Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and
Turkey. The hard-line Nusra Front rebels have gained strength, partly
because we have spurned moderates. The Syrian Army has won
ground. Prolonged war has deepened sectarian hatreds that will make it
harder than ever to put Syria back together.

The position of this blog has been providing all the support necessary
to ensure a rebel's victory from the start.

OK: Maybe this was the position of the hesitant people's side (besides
the ones already argued by Lantis -there will be Alewite refuges so
forth-): In Iraq there is Shiite minority, Sunni majority, we unseated
the regime, Shiite majority came to power, but then we had a pissed
off Sunni minority. They kept attacking the new government even after
power changed hands, because they are afraid of opression.

This thinking could go on ... "we have the reverse situation  in Syria with Sunni majority and Alewite minority. Let's have all minority / majority "mess" to take place _before_ any regime change so it does not happen after a new government is formed". A kind of "letting all sides blow off some steam" approach.
