# Week 2

Andersen: "Back in the 1930s and ’40s, there had been very left-wing
Democrats with serious national prominence and significant political
bases. Franklin Roosevelt’s own vice president Henry Wallace was one,
as most notably was Senator Huey Long of Louisiana, who introduced
bills in the 1930s to enact a 100 percent income tax on earnings over
the equivalent of $20 million and a wealth tax of 100 percent on
everything over 1 billion dollars. Which made the president seem
moderate when his 1935 'Soak the Rich Act' raised the tax on income
over 2 million to 55 percent. 'Political equality,' FDR said in 1936,
is 'meaningless in the face of economic inequality.' In what he
pitched as a Second Bill of Rights, he proposed guaranteeing all
Americans 'the right to earn enough' for 'a decent living' and 'a
decent home' and to have 'adequate medical care' paid for with 'a tax
[on] all unreasonable profits, both individual and corporate.' That
was 1944, Peak Leftism for Democrats on economics"

---

A side-effect of WT would be asset prices falling, bcz the rich would
look to sell some of the assets to cover the tax bill, if enough sell,
price falls, and that is good for the low-to-moderate-income folk.

---

States should pass Wealth Tax proposals, federal one needed too to
close the 34 trillion dollar federal debt hole.

---

US median home price is nearly half a million freaking dollars. This
is insane.

---

Multi-generational mortgage.. the real message here is *house prices
are that high*. 

---

What a daft son of a bitch. Brexit was a scam, migration did not stop
and there is still inequality. Instead of adressing the problem they
talked about stuff like this.

The Independent: "[2022] Boris Johnson wants ‘multi-generational’
mortgages so parents can pass on debt to children"

---

Bitcoin turned into an asset; enough people believe in it, which
creates some liquidity. Hell If the wealthy sink their money into that
instead of housing that cld be a good thing, would be a small change
surely but it cld help. BTC itself though is far away from its ideals
which was supplanting fiat currencies, instead it became a plaything
for the ultra rich. Look at their stupid commercials and endorsements
for this thing, all those promoters are loaded, they dont know where
to put their f-ing money anymore so they latch on to anything that has
some liquidity behind it.

Working for private sector does not equal being a good capitalist
either.  You are asked to manage a plant, or work as an accountant, you
are still in a bureucracy, not completely exposed to the market forces
outside your own corner. You are asked to do certain things, you judge
how long they would take, ask for resources, give a timeline. This is
technical, bureucratic work. You are not operating a lemonade stand
waiting for customers yourself. You are the guy behind the scenes,
working in the lemonade bureucracy.

According to Andersen's [great work](../../2023/06/evil-geniuses.html) low
taxes on the rich and unregulated business and weak unions and a weak
federal government "were portrayed as the only ways back to some kind
of rugged, frontiersy, stronger, better America", and "a winsome 1950s
actor in a cowboy hat" was the frontman for that sale. There aren't
that many Western movies now.. I wonder what replaced them as a
marketing vehicle for this "frontier mentality".. Superhero movies
maybe..? Look at Batman - he is like Ronald Reagan with a hero
suit. He seems to inhabit a non-governmental world where he "fights
bad people" whenever he wants, without asking the government. A
crime-fighting enterpreneur.. A disruptor. Sometimes the movies touch
the subject of vigilantism / government explicitly of course, but
maybe they "put a hat on it", making the propaganda into a story so
they can continue the propaganda.

Because this suboptimal idea was promoted by the First Black

had to have contributed something legendary, something with a big L

The Nation: "Even when Ackman wins, America often loses. In the fall
of 2011, for instance, Pershing Square acquired 14 percent of the
stock of Canadian Pacific Railway, becoming its largest
shareholder. The company carried grain, coal, chemicals, forest
products, and consumer goods across a nearly 15,000-mile
network.. After buying the stock.. [Ackman installed] a new chief
executive, E. Hunter Harrison.. Harrison had developed a system of
precision scheduling.. Based on Canadian Pacific’s example, precision
scheduled railroading (PSR) became the norm across the freight
industry. The result was reduced work crews, long hours, cutbacks in
time for sick leave..

The calamitous derailment of a Norfolk Southern train carrying
hazardous materials that occurred near East Palestine, Ohio, on
February 3, 2023, was caused in part by the reduction in work crews
mandated by PSR"

sanctioning ,and divesting from Israel may be an effective strategy to

of hourly time-matching requirements as the grid is deeply

Post-2020 inflation in the West occured bcz of limited-time direct
payments to people, that money came and went, so inflation naturally
came down. People who said inflation was transitionary were right.

---

The FED likely wanted asset prices to come down IMO (stocks, housing)
through its rate rises but it failed to achive that objective. I
believe they realized that now, and changed course. Inequality is the
culprit. Usual mechanisms are not working. Govs need to take out
the big stick if they want to avoid pitchforks later.

---

Judging recent econ events through inequality prism via Stevenson;
covid payments to people, even it went to them direct, still
contributed to inequality because everything they spent ended up with
the rich anyway (through corps they own, operate, have shares of).
Now govs are in more debt and the rich are richer because on top of
their existing wealth they ended up with the covid money as
well. Direct payments were necessary but govs always "forget" the next
step of such an action, taxing the rich to plug their debt.

Stevenson prediction on house prices was their prices would not fall
in a way that would make a difference even with higher rates, because
the wealthy, with their huge stash, could still buy homes without
needing a mortgage, either directly or through various investment
vehicles, so demand stayed high, prices did not fall.
