<h1>Week 46</h1>
<p>Thomas Frank, <em>NYT</em>: "The Elites Had It Coming..  At the Republican
convention in July, JD Vance described the ruination visited on his
working-class town in Ohio by NAFTA and trade with China, both of
which he blamed at least in part on Mr. Biden, and also the human toll
taken by the Iraq war, which he also contrived to blame on
Mr. Biden. Today Mr. Vance is the vice president-elect, and what I
hope you will understand, what I want you to mull over and take to
heart and remember for the rest of your life, is that he got there by
mimicking the language that Americans used to associate with labor,
with liberals, with Democrats..</p>
<p>A party of the left that identifies with people like Mr. Cheney is a
contradiction in terms, a walking corpse..</p>
<p>I have begun to doubt that any combination of financial disaster or
electoral chastisement will ever turn on the lightbulb for the
liberals. I fear that 90s-style centrism will march on, by a
sociological force of its own, until the parties have entirely
switched their social positions and the world is given over to
Trumpism. Can anything reverse it? Only a resolute determination by
the Democratic Party to rededicate itself to the majoritarian vision
of old: a Great Society of broad, inclusive prosperity. This means
universal health care and a higher minimum wage. It means robust
financial regulation and antitrust enforcement. It means unions and a
welfare state and higher taxes on billionaires, even the cool ones. It
means, above all, liberalism as a social movement, as a coming
together of ordinary people"</p>
<hr />
<p>ABC Australia <em>Planet America</em>: "The Democrats have [big]
problems.. There's been a lot of post-mortems recently one about [why]
they lost, and the groups they didn't do so well in. Actually if you
look carefully at everything, every single problem has one issue in
common, and that is they involve working class people. Talk about
Latinos they're 80% working class people, if you're talking about the
young men most of them don't go to college, we're talking about
working class people. And the Democrats won 44% of the working class
vote in this election..</p>
<p>The reason why that matters is because the Democrats have never.. won
an election in the last 100 years without winning the working class
vote, and this time they won 44%, they're not going to bounce back any
time in a hurry with that.. vote because they've been gradually losing
the working class vote for about 15 years now. And it's getting to a
crisis point..</p>
<p>[The senate] is a bigger problem in my view.. In the Senate, they just
lost Ohio they just lost Montana and they just lost Pennsylvania,
.. the problem [is] because the Democrats don't win the working class
vote anymore, there are 24 States they are non-competitive in. We call
them the Red States, what they really are the working class states,
and the Democrats don't compete in states where the working class
takes over. And they don't lose by a little bit, they lose by 10
points 15 points 20 points, they're not even close, what that means is
that.. Democrats can't afford to lose more than two seats in the rest
of America if they want a bare minimum for for a majority...</p>
<p>In the next two elections the Democrats need to win back Susan Collins
seat which they haven't been able to win for decades, they need to win
back Ron Johnson's seat in Wisconsin. Then McCormick's Pennsylvania
seat.. they need to win back one North Carolina seat and they haven't
won the seat in North Carolina forever. They have to win one North
Carolina seat and they need to lose no other seat, no Georgia - none
of the purple State seats, none of the Michigan seats, none of them,
in order to get 50 seats in the Senate. If they make one mistake,
they're not going to hold the Senate. If they win the presidency in
2028, then they're in a whole world of hurt because it doesn't get
better after that, they keep on having to have a perfect record,
because they're giving up for 48 Senate seats from the beginning. If
they don't make some inroads into the working class vote, they might
never hold the senate for 10 years or or 15 years, they might hold
presidencies without holding the Senate and they won't be able do
anything. They'll be crippled, and that could cripple them as a party
going forward"</p>
<hr />
<p>"Populism" is the word used by right and the left to avoid using the
word "left". Why avoid? The fight to bring leftist ideas to forefront
can proceed in parallel to fix the perception of the word
"left". Let's not avoid, embrace. Use it on the right-wing, "the
populist right" when they use ideas from the left and watch them
cringe. It is they who is on your turf not you on theirs. Make'm pay
for it. They use the word liberally (no pun intended) and as a slur
for this reason, they know they are stealing shit from you, they see
you as the competition and want to keep you down, permanently.</p>

DNC..  'I do think there’s this whole sentiment that we just went too
far out there on identity, and it allowed the Republicans to really
attack us at every turn as a result, and that we just essentially did
not focus on just the everyday issues of Americans,' said one DNC
member from California, granted anonymity to speak freely.. [a] member
from Florida put it: 'I don’t want to be the freak show party, like
they have branded us. You know, when you’re a mom with three kids, and
you live in middle America and you’re just not really into politics,

<p>Matt Kennard, <em>The Racket</em>: I started working as a reporter at the
<em>Financial Times</em> soon after the financial crisis began and at the
height of the so-called 'War on Terror'... There I was exposed to the
other side of this war-industry coin – the world of high
finance. These wars were not the vanity project of deluded leaders;
they were merely the latest stage in a global elite’s prolonged war on
the people of our world with the sole aim of pumping up their bottom
line. I saw the real rulers of the world up close now – they were not
the politicians but the big-money men behind them, the puppeteers who
made everything move...</p>
<p>As Harold Pinter wrote in his Nobel Prize-winning speech in 2005, when
it comes to the US 'it never happened. Nothing ever happened. Even
while it was happening it wasn’t happening. It didn’t matter. It was
of no interest.' He continued: 'The crimes of the United States have
been systematic, constant, vicious, remorseless, but very few people
have actually talked about them. You have to hand it to America. It
has exercised a quite clinical manipulation of power worldwide while
masquerading as a force for universal good. It’s a brilliant, even
witty, highly successful act of hypnosis.'  The media would have you
believe that there is no racket, that it’s purely an accident that we
live in a world where 85 people, 85 people, own half the world’s
wealth while more children die of starvation every year than died in
the Holocaust.</p>

<p>Frank, <em>Listen Liberal</em>: "[Democratic] party intensified its courtship
of the comely professional-managerial class. In 1974, in reaction to
the Watergate scandal, a huge group of Democrats was elected to
Congress—new-school Democrats, that is, who seemed to be largely
uninterested in traditional Democratic issues of economic
equality. 'The new Democrats came out of the anti-war protests and the
McGovern campaign, the Peace Corps and the women’s movement, the
professions and the suburbs,' writes [an] historian.. 'but not the
union halls and the wards.' Their de facto leader was the newly
elected senator Gary Hart, McGovern’s former campaign manager, a man
who made his name denouncing old-fashioned, working-class politics in
favor of a more tech-friendly vision.</p>
<p>Hart became a symbol of the Sixties generation’s revolt against the
workerist politics of their parents. 'The End of the New Deal' was the
title of Hart’s standard 1974 campaign speech; he liked to mock
old-school libs as 'Eleanor Roosevelt Democrats.'.. It was also the
occasion for the media’s discovery of the affluent and tasteful
'yuppie' — the 'Young Urban Professional' whose rise was supposed to
signal yet another break from the Democrats’ traditional blue-collar
demographic. The Jimmy Carter presidency was an earlier milestone. At
first Carter had seemed like a man who could recover the party’s
historic constituencies. But once in office, he broke with the New
Deal tradition in all sorts of highly visible ways, cancelling public
works projects and conspicuously snubbing organized labor"</p>
<hr />
<p>Hart followers abolished Glass-Steagal causing the 2008 crisis, with
their "market friendly" focus proposed Clintoncare, that turned into
Obamacare leaving 85 million people uninsured or underinsured. And
they are somehow shocked the working class abandoned them.</p>
<hr />
<p>Andersen: "In the 1984 Democratic primary, Gary Hart was still the
neoliberal apostate, running against the supposed mustiness of the New
Deal and the Great Society and government.. When Hart ran a second
time for president in 1988, one of his tax policy advisers was Arthur
Laffer, the inventor of supply-side economics. When Jerry Brown ran
for the 1992 Democratic nomination, he also sought Laffer’s help to
devise some kind of tax scheme 'that was clear and easy to
articulate,' and Laffer himself says he voted for Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Clinton was one of the founders in 1985 of the Democratic Leadership
Council. It was an attempt by an endangered species, white Southern
Democratic politicians, to remain relevant twenty years after their
die-off had begun. It also became a think-tankish anchor for Democrats
who didn’t disagree with Republicans that the only acceptable new
solutions to any social problem were market-based"</p>

<p>Malik, <em>The Guardian</em>: "Cosplaying social justice is the new elitist
way of elbowing out the working class. A new book by Musa al-Gharbi
accuses liberal professionals of talking about justice but entrenching
inequalities.. Al-Gharbi.. was a freshman at Columbia
University. Those profiting from the 'racial caste system' were fellow
students, many of them vocal about social justice, but largely
indifferent to the needs of those at the bottom of the social
hierarchy on whose labour their lives rested.</p>
<p>Four years later, many of these same students joined Black Lives
Matter protests. Al-Gharbi watched as they demonstrated on Broadway in
New York’s Upper West Side, oblivious to the [black homeless].. The
protesters 'were crowding the benches that homeless people were
using', insisting that 'Black Lives Matter', but apparently not 'the
Black guys right in front of them'.</p>
<p>This constant disparity between the professed beliefs of liberal
students agitating for social justice and actions that revealed an
indifference to the material injustice surrounding them led Al-Gharbi
to write a book to try to make sense of it... If you want to
understand what just happened in the US election, it is one of the
more useful starting points"</p>

itinerant preacher. 'They are for the powerful!' A technocrat at
heart, Gore would prove to be an imperfect populist messenger. But the
pivot seemed to work: he went from trailing by double digits to within
537 votes of winning the presidency...</p>
<p>Macomb County, Michigan, to the north of Detroit, has for decades been
a reference point for those seeking to win the white working class,
the home of the Reagan Democrat. It was here where Stanley Greenberg,
Bill Clinton’s 1992 pollster, held a famed series of focus groups to
understand how Democrats could win back the working-class majority
they had lost to Ronald Reagan. In the 1980s, a group of concerned
moderates in the party coalesced into the Democratic Leadership
Council, Arkansas governor Bill Clinton among them. The DLC warned
that the party had lost sight of the broad mass of working- and
middle- class Americans, fixating instead on a disparate menagerie of
identity groups— women, minorities, labor, and green voters. The
campaign that emerged from Macomb positioned Bill Clinton as the 'Man
from Hope,' a candidate focused only on one group: the middle class
that a large majority of Americans identified with...</p>
<p>By 2010, a yawning socioeconomic gap had opened among whites, with
much higher rates for lower-class whites.  Murray’s shorthand for this
divide, upper-class Belmont versus working-class Fishtown, was a
precursor to the Whole Foods–Cracker Barrel divide that would serve as
a metaphor for Trump-era politics"</p>

<p>Alfred Jazeera is focusing on "toxicity" after Dems suffered a huge
loss.. What are you trying to do, Al? Are you afraid if Dem's loss is
seen as having do with the country's moneyed interest treating the

militarism, US might pull out its bases from Qatar one day (the
financier of Al Jazeera)?</p>

<p>But Cuck knows it's a stupid strategy.. The point is blowing smoke up
your ass, herd enough people towards an unachievable goal so other
avenues are not discussed. They would do anything not to abandon their
Gary Hart / Clintonesque yuppie/shitlib, Republican-lite roots. White
collar professionalism is their religion.</p>

<p>Tom McGrath's <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/06/04/yuppies-donald-trump-book-excerpt-00160689">article</a>
makes clear, today's shitlib Democrats are deeply tied to Gary Hart's
legacy (Clinton was a huge follower). This group during the 84 Dem
primary were nonchalant about working class issues, and they actually
preferred Reagan over their own. "College-educated young professionals
had done better than most over the last four years, and seven in 10 of
them believed Reagan was more likely than Mondale to keep making them
better off financially". Prefering Republican over a leftist
Democrat.. Sound familiar? That's why, Clinton, as the torch bearer of
this movement needs to be destroyed in terms of legacy.  Anyone around
him, connected to him needs to be cleansed, expunged wholesale from
the party. Heads need to roll. Chop Chop.</p>

<p>H2 Central: "Speech by President von der Leyen at the Fourth Edition
of the Renewable Hydrogen Summit, via video message:</p>
<p>'One year ago, many of you gathered here in Brussels for the very first
Clean Transition Dialogue. We brought together the entire renewable
hydrogen value chain — from electrolyser manufacturers to off-taker
industries — to address one fundamental question: How do we scale
Europe’s hydrogen market faster?</p>
<p>Today, I am proud to share how far we’ve come. In just 12 months,
Europe has seen final investment decisions on over 2 gigawatts of
renewable hydrogen projects. That’s four times our current installed
capacity..</p>
<p>These decisions are more than milestones, they signal a new
chapter. Projects that secure all necessary funding and permits are
ready to break ground. Let me give you one example:</p>
<p>Stegra’s Boden steel plant in Sweden, supported by the European
Innovation Fund, will soon be the largest renewable hydrogen project
in the world. And it’s not alone. From Denmark to Romania, from
Germany to Portugal, 10 other large-scale projects have also moved
from concept to construction.</p>
<p>To put that into perspective, the United States saw just two such
decisions during the same period. This illustrates European leadership
in renewable hydrogen. In fact, investment in European hydrogen is set
to grow by 140% in 2024, with Europe contributing nearly a third of
global investments in electrolysers'"</p>

<p>The Lever: "The Allentown clinic was run by a nonprofit group called
Remote Area Medical, or RAM, which has been running free clinics
domestically and internationally since 1985... [The coordinator]
didn’t talk politics, but as he shared his own experience in the
medical field, he struck at a central issue at the heart of the
American health care system: It’s based around private health
insurance, and maximizing corporate profits. This is why the United
States spends more on health care than other wealthy countries, and
Americans experience worse health outcomes... RAM was originally
founded in 1985 with 'the intention to serve in remote areas of
developing countries,' according to a spokesperson. But since 2019,
with 'the need for free health care in the U.S.' being 'so vast,' it
has only operated in this country"</p>

<p>Brooks, NYT: "Society worked as a vast segregation system, elevating
the academically gifted above everybody else. Before long, the diploma
divide became the most important chasm in American life. High school
graduates die nine years sooner than college-educated people. They die
of opioid overdoses at six times the rate...</p>
<p>The Democratic Party has one job: to combat inequality. Here was a
great chasm of inequality right before their noses and somehow many
Democrats didn’t see it. Many on the left focused on racial
inequality, gender inequality and L.G.B.T.Q. inequality. I guess it’s
hard to focus on class inequality when you went to a college with a
multibillion-dollar endowment and do environmental greenwashing and
diversity seminars for a major corporation. Donald Trump is [.. bad],
but there’s something off about an educated class that looks in the
mirror of society and sees only itself...</p>
<p>As the left veered toward identitarian performance art, Donald
Trump['s] Queens-born resentment of the Manhattan elites dovetailed
magically with the class animosity being felt by rural people across
the country. His message was simple: These people have betrayed you,
and they are morons to boot"</p>
