<p>"Why Americans Are Nuts About Peanut Butter... First of all, the
United States grows a ton of peanuts. .. Growing peanuts became a big
thing in the early 1900s when the cotton crop was suffering in the
South, and we still grow a lot of peanuts today. Peanut butter’s birth
year explains our obsession even more. In World War I, the Great
Depression, and World War II, America was in search of inexpensive,
filling, and nutritious ways to feed its people. So people turned to
peanut butter, and it stuck. Peanut butter sandwiches were given out
in food lines during the Great Depression and were part of Army
rations in both World Wars"</p>
<hr />
<p>"Americans consume [on average] about twenty-two tablespoons [of
peanut butter] per person per year... Europeans on average consume
less than one tablespoon.. per person annually"</p>
<hr />
<p>Do they <em>have</em> to eat peanut based products? America is so coo coo
about peanuts some ppl not being able to eat it sounds scandalous.</p>

<p>Because both he and Kurt Russell played in two different movies about
Wyatt Earp and his movie sucked, Russell's movie <em>Tombstone</em> did
great. Costner might be jealous, he keeps making Westerns until he

<p>"Why does Kevin Costner keep making westerns?"</p>

<p>Battles around Bakhmut were an example of AW. The fact that the
frontlines "did not move" for a long time was on purpose, not due to
RU shortcomings. At one point the Wagner chief -while still alive-,
was commenting "well we could dash ahead and take Kramatorsk". But
rushing ahead taking shit is not the point.. Clearly the guy did not
get the memo. RU battle plan was about degrading UA's ability to make
war. Wag chief as a bidnessman was probably looking at the theather
like a market to incrase his share in, "I can open a corner sandwich
shop over there, I can expand..". But the RU top brass had a different
plan. He was asked to execute on a portion of that plan. He failed
(then he was died).</p>

<p>Vershinin: "[2024/03] The Attritional Art of War: If the West is
serious about the possibility of a great power conflict, it needs to
take a hard look at its capacity to wage a protracted war and to
pursue a strategy focused on attrition rather than
manoeuvre. Attritional wars require their own ‘Art of War’ and are
fought with a ‘force-centric’ approach, unlike wars of manoeuvre which
are ‘terrain-focused’. They are rooted in massive industrial capacity
to enable the replacement of losses, geographical depth to absorb a
series of defeats, and technological conditions that prevent rapid
ground movement. In attritional wars, military operations are shaped
by a state’s ability to replace losses and generate new formations,
not tactical and operational manoeuvres. The side that accepts the
attritional nature of war and focuses on destroying enemy forces
rather than gaining terrain is most likely to win...</p>
<p>Only after meeting these criteria should offensive operations
commence. They should be launched across a broad front, seeking to
overwhelm the enemy at multiple points with shallow attacks. The
intent is to remain inside a layered bubble of friendly protective
systems, while stretching depleted enemy reserves until the front
collapses. Only then should the offensive extend towards objectives
deeper in the enemy rear. Concentration of forces on one main effort
should be avoided as this gives an indication of the offensive’s
location and an opportunity for the enemy to concentrate their
reserves against this key point. The Brusilov Offensive of 1916, which
resulted in the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian army, is a good
example of a successful attritional offensive at the tactical and
operational level" via Col. Daniel Davis, Jacques Baud</p>

are then blended with oxygen from air to make the fats &amp; oils we know,

<p>Hydrogen-Powered Air Taxi.. In a significant milestone for sustainable
aviation, a hydrogen-powered air cab has completed an 842-kilometer
flight.. Joby is one of several companies at the forefront of creating
air cab services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL)
vehicles. Initially, the company focused on developing all-electric
aircraft with a range of approximately 160 kilometers, intended for
urban and intercity transport. Joby recently adapted a prototype of
its electric aircraft to operate on hydrogen. Equipped with a liquid
hydrogen tank and a fuel system, the modified VTOL successfully
completed a flight of 842 kilometers over Marina, California, using
only 90% of its hydrogen fuel load.</p>

AHEAD (1995) and it completely missed the Internet boom that would
follow in a few years. Let alone the road ahead, the book could not

<p>Gates did a little better after his CEO stint, maybe there's something
blinding about being a tech CEO. You are too mired in the market, your
market share, sales, every thought has to be shaped in service to
that, and they miss the general trend. They are easily gripped by
FOMO, blinded by hype.</p>

<p>'My T-shirt displayed the text "Not in Our Name" on the front side and
"Jews Say Ceasefire Now" on the back... Before the flight had even
taken off, I was approached while I was seated on the plane by a
flight attendant who requested that I either change or cover up my
shirt because some passengers found the message offensive.. I
requested that the people who had complained about the nature of my
shirt come talk to me directly..</p>
<p>About 5 to 10 minutes later, a purser (also known as a chief flight
attendant or cabin manager) came to my seat and explained that I had
to cover up the shirt, because Delta had a policy against showcasing
political messages of any kind. I once again refused to cover up the
shirt. The purser then threatened to kick me off the flight unless I
obliged her wishes. Because I wanted to get to my destination, I
covered up the "Jews Say Ceasefire Now" shirt for the time being with
a nondescript white shirt. The flight took off'"</p>

<p>So write Andrew Byers and Randall Schweller in <em>Foreign Affairs</em>.
Schweller, an academic at Ohio State, is a card-carrying foreign
policy realist, and is willing to put his name to a claim that we have
argued in these pages all along: Donald Trump, despite his mercurial
nature and despite the opposition from entrenched interests in
Washington, DC, is fundamentally displaying a realist instinct in his
foreign policy... [he writes] 'an "America first" agenda is an
intellectually defensible, fundamentally realist program that seeks to
ascertain and act on the United States’ national interests rather than
the interests of others'"</p>

<p>'He represents something in the country that the coastal elites and
big business have taken too long to recognise,' [a bank] lobbyist
added, in an apparent reference to Vance’s ability to channel the
anger and disenfranchisement of the working classes...</p>
<p>Vance has espoused a protectionist trade policy, stricter immigration
laws, higher minimum wages and a more aggressive approach to antitrust
enforcement. He made headlines earlier this year when he described
Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan as one of the Biden
administration officials 'doing a pretty good job'...</p>
<p>Those kind of comments have concerned investors in particular. One top
New York dealmaker said picking Vance as vice-president 'would not be
reassuring to the business community, and could signal an anti-M&amp;A
mindset for the second Trump administration'"</p>
