technology labs and strategic acquisitions of hydrogen-focused

<p>The statement below assumes extracted carbon = newly deposed carbon
which cancels out, we get net zero. But after carbon is extracted to
make synthetic methane, the produced methane needs to be tracked
seperately from carbon, methane is its own GHG, 20 times more potent
than carbon. The budgeting makes incorrect assumptions.</p>
<p>I am not a big fan of synthetic fuels made by recycling carbon. The
world needs the cleanest solution, in its purest form. We need to cut
the knot, like Alexander, not untie it. Attempting to extend existing
systems, like "the grid", or fossil fuels by supposedly making
synthetic versions of the latter while "being careful about their
carbon budgeting" will result in a fragile system and be too open to
cheating. Imagine the Volkswagen situation multiplied by 10. </p>

off several hydrogen-powered bicycles and a small at-home hydrogen
generator for [refueling] the bike by producing small bottles of
hydrogen gas..</p>
<p>Those little hydrogen tanks, around the size of a 500 mL water bottle,
hold enough hydrogen for around 60 km or 36 miles of riding. They feed
hydrogen into an on-board hydrogen fuel cell, which uses a chemical
process to convert the hydrogen into electricity, with the only output
being water.</p>
<p>[H2 bikes have] a few advantages over traditional e-bikes. Almost all
electric bicycles these days use lithium-ion batteries, which usually
require problematic or otherwise rare materials to produce. As much as
battery makers have tried to limit the amount of such minerals, we’re
often still beholden to suppliers from a handful of countries using
sometimes unethical means to procure the necessary materials to
produce these batteries.</p>

<p>Col Wilkerson: "The four stars in the Armed Forces of the United
States are a basket case of wooden headedness and stupidity. Just look
at what they've been doing of late. 26 out of 32, 80% of the recently
retiring flag officers at that rank level went to military contractors
post-retirement. This is their dream, this is their glory. Look at
Admiral Burke who used to boast that he [was a great commander]..  Now
he's up on charges, it looks like he's been involved in corruption,
been offered a $500,000 a year job because of that corruption after
his retirement. This guy I thought was one of the last four stars in
the United States Navy that was worth a damn. Now I've got to revisit
that opinion completely and cast him with the rest of the fools.</p>
<p>Look at Afghanistan, 20 years no one held to account, no one fired, no
one ripped up (one person was sort of pseudo-fired). And then look at
Iraq, all the four stars, three stars there that came home and were
service chiefs or something else, got their promotions, got their big
job in the military-industrial complex. No one punished, no one held
accountable. We have fools, fools running the United States military
today.</p>
<p>So I gotta believe that Biden is getting a whole plateful of really
bad advice. You had David Petraeus out there months ago saying there
was no way Russia was going to prevail, Ukraine was going to prevail.
Well David I'm sorry, I knew you lied about Iraq when you were telling
me at the State Department that Iraqi battalions were ready for
action, and my spy in Baghdad was telling me that 10 to 30% on any
given day of your Iraqi battalions were AWOL, so I know David Petraeus
lies for a profession. But it's a combination of things like that...</p>
<p>Look at the correlation of forces once again, which I was looking at
on the day of the invasion, and said no way Ukraine prevails not
unless NATO in force joins it, and then it'll be touch and go, because
[Russia is a] 140 to 150 million nation with 11 times zones and a
latent industrial base that now is cooking on all eight cylinders by
the way, against less than 40 million. Most of [Ukraine's] industrial
base was shipped off to the new Russia once the Soviet Union stood
stood down along with their nuclear weapons, and what remained in
Ukraine was producing heavy equipment for the Russians. This is absurd
for any military professional unless he's interested in politics and
interested in getting a really good well-paying job in the
military-industrial complex who by the way are making billions off
this Ukraine conflict"</p>

<p>Stefan Rahmstorf: "What does 3 °C of global warming mean for us?.. A
useful perspective on a warming of 3 degrees is provided by the
Earth’s history. According to current knowledge, one must go back
about three million years, to the Pliocene, to find a similarly high
global temperature. This already indicates that large parts of today’s
biosphere are not adapted by evolution to such a warm Earth. Many
species would not survive it. In the Pliocene, our ancestors, the
australopitheci, still lived partly on trees...</p>
<p>The US has already reached around 1.7 °C of warming.. Because the US
is a land area, this is not surprising, since many land areas are
warming about twice as fast as the global mean, 70% of which draws on
ocean temperatures. The average warming of all land areas in 2020 was
2.0 °C. With 3 degrees of global warming, we can therefore expect
around 6 degrees of warming on land.</p>
<p>A 6-degree rise in the annual average temperature—that’s a lot. This
would make New York roughly as warm as Los Angeles is today. And while
some might dream of California weather conditions, this completely new
climate will not please farmers or the local fora and fauna at all. It
is likely to lead to widespread drought problems, wild fires and
forest dieback.</p>

<p>First order of business outlaw tax havens. Second order of business,
outlaw all SEZ.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's no joke, inside those places private firms rule, the host country
turns a blind eye to employer offenses, there are no unions, companies
set the rules. I'm convinced they could shoot a man at will, cover it
up, and the legal framework would allow it #SEZ</p>
<hr />
<p>Kennard, <em>Silent Coup</em>: "[W]e next wanted to look into the secession
of territory globally to private investors... we found a lawyer.. who
had described how [Special Economic Zones] SEZs vary widely in their
details, but that they often involve 'excluding or modifying the
application of parts of the national law in defined geographic areas'</p>
<p>These weren’t just carve-outs of physical territory, therefore – they
were also exceptional spaces where normal rules didn’t necessarily
apply. These zones also seemed to often offer the – sometimes explicit
– promise of a steady supply of cheap and compliant labour for
investors’ factories. The reality of promised jobs included numerous
reports of worker’s rights abuses in ‘sweatshops’.</p>
<p>The ILO said ‘trade unions point to these zones as being islands,
outside the scope of traditional industrial relations ... that are a
symptom of the race to the bottom in the global economy.’ A worldwide
patchwork of these spaces seemed to mean that, once one workforce
began to mobilize and demand better wages or conditions, companies
could leave and move on to another.</p>
<p>The World Bank, we found, had produced many reports studying and
promoting SEZs.  Along with investing in private businesses, its IFC
branch and other bank teams gave developing country governments
‘advice’ on how to make themselves more attractive to private
investors, including what laws they should change. Such zones seemed
to be a regular item on the menu.. [A] researcher at Utrecht
University, had studied SEZs for years. They are commonly 'regulated
differently than a nation’s 'normal' territory, to the extent that
they may have their own police forces with considerable sovereignty',
