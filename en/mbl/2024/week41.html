<p>You see 2-3% for sample sizes at about 1000.  $SD(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{pq / n}$,
Let's use equal votes $p = q = 0.5$, $n = 1000$, then 95% confidence interval
means $2 \sqrt{(0.5)(0.5)/1000}$,</p>

<p>"AIPAC running the whole show" narrative is useful for the complex,
who hide behind a foreign culprit and continue running the show. That
way, there is less pressure on the complex to change, they can remain
in the shadows and Israeli lobby get all the attention. ISR is
actually fine with that too, they look mean, "scary", they supposedly
have the entire US system hostage, "West Asia fear us". Building on
this same theater, the bought and paid for US political class can
throw up their hands in mock frustration and say "we talk them they

boss. The boss wins all the time, American people lose whose

that is.. they are very open-minded, they don't care about Democrats

they say, and that means support whatever Israel and Mr Netanyahu
wants. That's the situation, so we don't really control our government
at this point, and if you look at the most strident advocates for the
destruction of Arab life, Muslim life.. or Iranians or anybody else,
those people are rewarded handsomely with enormous amounts of money
for their reelection campaigns to keep their seats, and ultimately to
benefit in the private sector from enormously lucrative deals that
make them millionaires. It's no secret that most people that come to

which remained once Einstein’s errors and unproven assertions were
eliminated could best be treated successfully by classical
mechanics. He refers to literature written by Einstein’s supporters as
being subjective, delivering unsound and insufficiently proven claims
from a 'cult of believers.' 'Belief' rather than evidence-based
scientific reasoning recurs several times in Gullstrand’s discussions
of those who accept Einstein’s theories.</p>
<p>The British eclipse data, according to Gullstrand, are useless. Even
if the minute bending of starlight actually received confirmation,
that would not constitute proof of Einstein’s 4D space-time...
Gullstrand refers extensively to [aether-physicist] Bjerknes’ effort
to account for the deflection using classical physics. In the end,
Gullstrand asserts that Einstein’s theories are devoid of any real
content and have no relationship with physical reality; they lacked
'the significance for physics for which an awarding with a Nobel Prize
can come into question'</p>

vectoring alone disqualifies it for 5th gen of course. Another
downside, too expensive, 100 mil dollars a pop. Tigga basically built
a more costly F-16. If it goes against any other 5th gen I suspect
