AFR: "First Graphene has completed a 12-month project in the United
Kingdom to develop low-cost, high-performing electrocatalysts for
hydrogen production... Supported by AUD$183,000 (around USD 121,300)
in funding from Innovate UK, the project trialed production of
graphene enhanced water-splitting electrocatalysts... The Company
benchmarked the graphene enhanced, low-cost electrocatalysts against
two different commercial catalyst materials, assessing the product’s
stability and mass activity. Results indicated First Graphene’s
catalyst requires less energy to produce hydrogen when compared to a
commercial iridium catalyst in similar conditions"

[H. J. RES. 54](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-joint-resolution/54),
calling for a constitutional amendment to establish that corporations
aren't people, now has 80 sponsors in the House. Section 2 of the
resolution addresses campaign contributions. Personally, I think it
should be in an additional amendment since there are those who would
support one of these sections but not the other. I believe that an
amendment should be single-subject and not an omnibus"

Angela Nagle: "[2018] The Left Case against Open Borders.. With
obscene images of low-wage migrants being chased down as
criminals.. others drowning in the Mediterranean, and the worrying
growth of anti-immigrant sentiment across the world, it is easy to see
why the Left wants to defend illegal migrants against being targeted
and victimized. And it should. But acting on the correct moral impulse
to defend the human dignity of migrants, the Left has ended up pulling
the front line too far back, effectively defending the exploitative
system of migration itself"

\#Egypt \#Protests

Turchin: "[Previous Egyptian president] Mubarak gained power in the
usual manner: by first working his way through the military ranks and
then becoming the heir apparent of his predecessor, Anwar
Sadat. However, once in power, he broke the rules of succession by
starting to groom his son, Gamal Mubarak, as successor. Gamal did not
work his way to power through the army ranks; instead, he earned ​an
MBA and became a leader of the new economic elites in Egypt. Had Gamal
succeeded his father as ruler of Egypt, it would have amounted to a
social revolution in which the old military elites were replaced by
the new economic elites. The army officers were clearly not enthused
about losing power. According to Korotayev’s reconstruction of the
intraelite conflicts underlying the revolution (followed by the
counterrevolution), when massive protests erupted in 2011, the army
stood aside and allowed the Mubarak regime to fall"
