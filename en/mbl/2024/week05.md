Railway Tech: "The Italian railway operator, Ferrovie della Calabria
(FdC), has recently finalised an agreement for the procurement of
three new narrow-gauge hydrogen-powered trains. The deployment of
these trains is expected to begin in 2026"

The Lever: "It Just Got More Expensive To Fight Corporate Abuse.. From
credit card terms of service to employment contracts, millions of
people are trapped in agreements that only allow them to challenge
corporate abuse through a private system of arbitration rather than in
a court of law. Now, the biggest player in that private system has
posted new fees that experts say could make it more difficult for
consumers and workers to hold corporations accountable.

On Jan. 15, the American Arbitration Association (AAA), the largest
private provider of arbitration services in the world, quietly
implemented new fees for individuals filing a mass arbitration case
seeking monetary damages or contract relief from a company"

They are not wrong for asking that, they call for being taxed along
with all others who are also wealthy. If you are doing it on your own,
it would be a drop in the bucket. A policy that applies across the
board can cause change.

simply giving it away?"

Household income adjusted for inflation compared to 80s. It is
essentially stagnant, in the meantime the wealth of the top 1% grew by
a factor of 9. That is growth by 900%. Median household income grew by
a meager %9.

In an "all money is debt to FED" world it would seem hyperinflation is
unlikely... Because all money is debt, it has to be paid back,
eventually all debt is due. When paid back money disappears, it is
taken out of the circulation = less inflationary pressure (extra money
held by regular people increasing circulation causes inf). I believe
hyperinflation, as it is seen in Argentina, Zimbabwe, and similar
places is almost always an outside-the-system print-without-debt
phenomena. Somebody is using the printing press, through the backdoor.

Andersen: "[After 80s] The probability that elected Democrats would
tend to increase my taxes wasn’t a reason I voted for them, but my
indifference to the financial hit.. felt virtuous, low-end noblesse
oblige. However, even after the right got its way on the political
economy, many people like me weren’t viscerally, actively skeptical of
business or Wall Street either... Affluent college-educated people,
Democrats as well as Republicans, began using the phrase 'socially

meant low taxes in return for tolerance of.. *whatever*, as long it
didn’t cost affluent people anything. It was a libertarianism lite

Increasing innovation is not enough to provide a target for all the
wealth sloshing around in the system. There is just too much money
held by too few, and many will chose to park it in assets rather than
risk it on innovation. Large asset holders need to lose some of their
money. This is win-lose situation, somebody needs to lose, and it can't
be the regular people.

The answer to that is summarized in this paragraph from the

'We find disconcerting trends for maintainability. Code churn -- the
percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than two weeks
after being authored -- is projected to double in 2024 compared to its

Sifted: "Norwegian startup Photoncycle says it can store solar energy
from summer to winter cheaper than batteries..  The idea for the
company began when Brandtzaeg was a visiting fellow at MIT in the
US.. Brandtzaeg holds up a chalk-looking substance: 'With this, you
can store electricity 20 times as densely as in a lithium battery.'

'We're locking up the hydrogen molecules in a solid to basically fix
them. We're using a reversible, high-temperature fuel cell, so we're
assisting a fuel cell which both can produce hydrogen and electricity
in the same cell,' he says...That means no need to cool the hydrogen
down, making it non-flammable and giving it a higher density than an
ion-lithium battery"

MMT was popular for a while, they had MSM exposure, my speculation is
its inventors said some things that were useful for the rich. Their
main message seemed to be "printing money is not a problem, print it
until you see inflation", read: no need for taxes (esp wealth
tax). Corps would like that message so they pushed it. Of course the
approach is unworkable. If money is debt accrued when FED print the
money, we can't willy nilly print it to give it to even infra
projects, or people. We surely cannot print money that is not tied to
debt that is failed-state, hyperinflation territory. Plus, if due to
lopsidedness of econ the money flows to the rich and big corps anyway,
they will end up with more wealth just like they did after QE and
Covid. So MMT while might be 'useful', as in idiot, for some, it was
not sound policy.

Hedges: "The moral Universe has now been turned upside down. Those of
us who oppose genocide are accused of advocating it, those who carry
out genocide are said to have the right to defend themselves. Vetoing
ceasefires and providing 2,000 lb bombs to Israel that throw out out
metal fragments in densely packed refugee camps is the road to peace.
Refusing to negotiate to free the hostages, bombing hospitals,
schools, mosques, churches, ambulances and refugee camps obliterating
families are routine acts of war. Carrying out genocide in Gaza is a
way to de-radicalize Palestinians, attacking Houthi bases in Yemen is
deescalating a regional conflict. And remember it is not only Israel
which has abandoned its citizens held hostage in Gaza, there are
hundreds of Palestinians who are US citizens or permanent residents
trapped in Gaza and the Biden Administration is making no discernable
effort, as demanded by US law, to secure their safety"

Jeffrey Sachs: "US Foreign Policy Is a Scam Built on Corruption.

US foreign policy seems to be utterly irrational. The US gets into one
disastrous war after another -- Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya,
Ukraine, and Gaza. In recent days, the US stands globally isolated in
its support of Israel’s genocidal actions against the Palestinians,
voting against a UN General Assembly resolution for a Gaza ceasefire
backed by 153 countries with 89% of the world population, and opposed
by just the US and 9 small countries with less than 1% of the world
population.

In the past 20 years, every major US foreign policy objective has
failed.. American foreign policy is not at all about the interests of
the American people. It is about the interests of the Washington
insiders, as they chase campaign contributions and lucrative jobs for
themselves, staff, and family members. In short, US foreign policy has
been hacked by big money..

As a result, the American people are losing big. The failed wars since
2000 have cost them around $5 trillion in direct outlays, or around
40,000 per household. Another 2 trillion or so will be spent in the
coming decades on veterans’ care. Beyond the costs directly incurred
by Americans, we should also recognize the horrendously high costs
suffered abroad, in millions of lives lost and trillions of dollars of
destruction to property and nature in the war zones...

Yet to describe these gargantuan costs is also to explain the twisted
“rationality” of US foreign policy. The $1.5 trillion in military
outlays is the scam that keeps on giving—to the military-industrial
complex and the Washington insiders—even as it impoverishes and
endangers America and the world..

To understand the foreign-policy scam, think of today’s federal
government as a multi-division racket controlled by the highest
bidders...  Interestingly, the Health Industry division rivals the
Foreign Policy division as a remarkable financial scam. America’s
health outlays totaled an astounding $4.5 trillion in 2022, or roughly
36,000 per household, by far the highest health costs in the world,
while America ranked roughly 40th in the world among nations in life
expectancy. A failed health policy translates into very big bucks for
the health industry, just as a failed foreign policy translates into
mega-revenues of the military-industrial complex"

The gov pictured in 1984 is bad, but why emphasize governance rather
than opressive corporate power? Emphasis is key.

---

The 1984 angle sounds anti-government gaslighting, and it fits to the
spirit of the age. Pro-rich, anti-goverment. They fooled an entire
generation with this stuff, and now the results are in. A complete
catastrophy.

Andersen: "January 1984, Apple had introduced the Macintosh. Its
famous Super Bowl ad, based on George Orwell’s *1984*, featured a
heroine smashing the tyrants’ huge telescreen, a lone nonconformist
underdog spectacularly defying the oppressive Establishment. It suited
the moment and digital early adopters who were politically aware but
not actually, specifically political, in a stylish little allegory
with which everyone from Ayn Rand fans to Hart fans to Deadheads might
identify.  Steve Jobs, not yet thirty, had just become the sort of
emblematic generational avatar that Gary Hart pretended he wasn’t
desperate to be. In an.. interview, Jobs bragged about his vast wealth
— 'at 23, I had a net worth of over a million .. and at 25, it was
over $100 million' — and about his indifference to it: 'I’m the only
person I know that’s lost a quarter of a billion dollars in one year.'
Jobs didn’t mind coming across as a jerk, just not a standard business
jerk—because he was 'well-grounded in the... sociological traditions
of the ’60s,' like other Silicon Valley baby boomers"

Clean Technica: "BASF is also jumping into the anti-LNG

million USD) from the government of Norway to develop an
ammonia-to-hydrogen pipeline. Norway is also interested in the green
ammonia angle, which makes sense considering its access to offshore
wind resources. 'Green ammonia acts as a liquid battery with a high
energy density compared with alternative solutions for storing and
transporting renewable power. The infrastructure for the large-scale
transport of ammonia at sea already exists via a fleet of gas tankers
having ammonia on the cargo list,' Riviera explains"

Post 2008 QE, although it saved econ from total collapse, helped to
push inequality to greater heights. QE was about the FED buying bonds
from the banks, so they ended up with money *now* instead of a future
income from that debt. The hope was they would lend this money to
businesses, who would hire more people, pay them better. That did not
happen. The rich do not have to pay workers better, they can simply
buy existing assets to park their money at. They did precisely that
post 2008, stock prices and house prices went through the roof, and
people got nothing.

Gov cannot forget the final step of any cash injection into economy,
the money will end up with in the hands of the wealthy, so they need
to be taxed, to both lower inequality, lower asset prices, and also to
plug the budget deficit that was accrued during the injection phase.
