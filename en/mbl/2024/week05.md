# Week 5

Capitalists haven't had a unique idea in hundreds of years. The idea
always seems to be either finding or creating a commons to enclose,
and then either subdividing or breaking apart those artificial
enclosures like some kind of shell game.

The work of helping people live a decent life is roughly the same no
matter what, it's just a game of monopolist musical chairs as to who
gets to control or renovate the circumstances of that work and its
delivery"

The gov pictured in 1984 is bad, but why emphasize governance rather
than opressive corporate power? Emphasis is key.

---

The 1984 angle sounds anti-government gaslighting, and it fits to the
spirit of the age. Pro-rich, anti-goverment. They fooled an entire
generation with this stuff, and now the results are in. A complete
catastrophy.

Andersen: "January 1984, Apple had introduced the Macintosh. Its
famous Super Bowl ad, based on George Orwell’s *1984*, featured a
heroine smashing the tyrants’ huge telescreen, a lone nonconformist
underdog spectacularly defying the oppressive Establishment. It suited
the moment and digital early adopters who were politically aware but
not actually, specifically political, in a stylish little allegory
with which everyone from Ayn Rand fans to Hart fans to Deadheads might
identify.  Steve Jobs, not yet thirty, had just become the sort of
emblematic generational avatar that Gary Hart pretended he wasn’t
desperate to be. In an.. interview, Jobs bragged about his vast wealth
— 'at 23, I had a net worth of over a million .. and at 25, it was
over $100 million' — and about his indifference to it: 'I’m the only
person I know that’s lost a quarter of a billion dollars in one year.'
Jobs didn’t mind coming across as a jerk, just not a standard business
jerk—because he was 'well-grounded in the... sociological traditions
of the ’60s,' like other Silicon Valley baby boomers"

Clean Technica: "BASF is also jumping into the anti-LNG
pool... Höegh..  specializes in building platforms for offshore LNG
operations, and it apparently it is interested in applying its
know-how to ammonia. As reported by the maritime news organization
Riviera, the consortium has received funding of €5.9M (about $6.5
million USD) from the government of Norway to develop an
ammonia-to-hydrogen pipeline. Norway is also interested in the green
ammonia angle, which makes sense considering its access to offshore
wind resources. 'Green ammonia acts as a liquid battery with a high
energy density compared with alternative solutions for storing and
transporting renewable power. The infrastructure for the large-scale
transport of ammonia at sea already exists via a fleet of gas tankers
having ammonia on the cargo list,' Riviera explains"

Post 2008 QE, although it saved econ from total collapse, helped to
push inequality to greater heights. QE was about the FED buying bonds
from the banks, so they ended up with money *now* instead of a future
income from that debt. The hope was they would lend this money to
businesses, who would hire more people, pay them better. That did not
happen. The rich do not have to pay workers better, they can simply
buy existing assets to park their money at. They did precisely that
post 2008, stock prices and house prices went through the roof, and
people got nothing.

Gov cannot forget the final step of any cash injection into economy,
the money will end up with in the hands of the wealthy, so they need
to be taxed, to both lower inequality, lower asset prices, and also to
plug the budget deficit that was accrued during the injection phase.

Whether it’s true or not that '90% of everything is crap', the tech
giants are investing heavily in a hot new technology that promises to
boost that figure up to an impressively reliable 'five-nines'
percentage"

It's good to admit.. this is a nice thing to do

Arab News: "Long gone is the Joe Biden of February 2023, strolling
confidently through the streets of Kyiv, basking in the role as
champion of the Ukrainian cause in the fight against Vladimir Putin’s
Russia. Nearly one year after that triumphant appearance, the US
president is instead facing the harsh realities of running for
re-election while bogged down in one stagnant war and navigating the
volatility of another, as the conflict in Gaza threatens at any moment
to ignite the entire Middle East"
