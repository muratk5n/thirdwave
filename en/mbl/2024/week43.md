Doctorow: "Billionaires are why we can’t have nice things — a sensible
climate policy, workers’ rights, a functional Supreme Court and
legislatures that answer to the people, rather than deep-pocketed
donors.

The source of billionaires’ power isn’t mysterious: it’s their
money. Take away the money, take away the power. With more than a
dozen states considering wealth taxes, we’re finally in a race to the
top, to see which state can attack the corrosive power of extreme
wealth most aggressively"

RULES BASED ORDER

Fisk: "I have sought in vain to discover the origin of our
journalistic use of the word 'settlements.' By its nature, the
expression is almost comforting. It has a permanence about it, a
notion of legality. Every human wants to 'settle,' to have a home. The
far more disturbing—and far more accurate—word for Israel’s
land-grabbing in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 is
colonising. Settlers are colonists. Almost all the Israelis in the
West Bank are living on someone else’s land. They may say that God
gave them the land, but those Palestinians who legally owned that
land— who had property deeds to prove it, since the British Mandate,
since the Ottoman empire—are not allowed to appeal to God. Successive
Israeli governments have supported this theft of property, and by
2003, 400,000 Israeli Jews were living in the occupied territories in
explicit violation of Article 49 of the Geneva Convention — which
states that 'the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of
its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'

In all the long, fruitless negotiations with the Palestinians, the
Israelis would always maintain that the return of any territory was
'giving' land for peace—as if the occupied territories were legally
Israeli property of which it could dispose if it was generously
minded. So it is important to recall that the policy of implanting
Jewish colonists on occupied Arab land since 1967 has been
consistently and enthusiastically supported by successive Israeli
governments"
