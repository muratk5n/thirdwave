QM needs to be interfaced to probability and statistics. That way we
bring to bear all we know from those fields. We know samples,
distributions, random variables. Why can't we use those concepts
as-is? QM ppl have to deal with *negative probabilities*, this is
unheard of in the field of probability. QM is unmathematical, even
unscientific. It's just a collection of recipes. QM is science to the
extent a cookbook is science.

---

Theory must assign stochasticity to the right place. I can stand at a
street corner with a notebook and ask everyone passing by their weight
and jot down the answer. When I plot the freq of all answers I get a
Gaussian curve. The stochasticity is in the world at large that
"randomly" sends people to my corner (in SED that would be the ZPF). I
take a look at that sample and find out the distribution, looking at
many data points. That is different than saying "noone has a weight
until I ask them". This is onthologically stupid.  Yet this is
precisely what people do with Copenhagen QM. They go further, let's
say before I ask the next guy any question, we throw dude in a box,
what is the man's weight? Well according to classical interp he is
both skinny and fat at the same time.

SED makes the aether stochastic rather than the individual particle.

Cetto: "[To make QM work] physicists must renounce once and for all
the hope for a detailed description of the individual. Further, since
the concept of probability is being applied to a single event and no
sample space can be constructed, there is no consistent way of viewing
the result as a property of the system, and it must be interpreted as
an uncertainty of our knowledge. The observer slips thus into the
description, and the fundamental principle that physics refers to the
world rather than to our knowledge of it, is eroded."

Bell: "...[quantum-mechanical] vagueness, subjectivity, and
indeterminism, are not forced on us by experimental facts, but by
deliberate theoretical choice"

Heidi Peltier: "We Get What We Pay For: The Cycle of Military
Spending, Industry Power, and Economic Dependence.. Military spending
makes up a dominant share of discretionary spending in the United
States; military personnel make up the majority of U.S. government
manpower; and military industry is a leading force in the
U.S. economy. As a result, other elements and capacities of the
U.S. government and civilian economy have been weakened, and military
industries have gained political power. Decades of high levels of
military spending have changed U.S. government and society –
strengthening its ability to fight wars, while weakening its
capacities to perform other core functions. Investments in
infrastructure, healthcare, education, and emergency preparedness, for
instance, have all suffered as military spending and industry have
crowded them out. Increased resources channeled to the military
further increase the political power of military industries, ensuring
that the cycle of economic dependence continues – militarized sectors
of the economy see perpetual increases in funding and manpower while
other human needs go unmet...

The federal government workforce is comprised of about 3.5 million
workers, if we include both civilians and uniformed active-duty
personnel. Of this, about 72 percent is defense-related employment,
including Department of Defense civilians, uniformed military
personnel, and those working in Veterans Affairs. By comparison, the
Department of Health and Human Services made up 4 percent of federal
employees, and the Department of State only 1 percent"

ECP: "With aims to become a key player in the global energy
transition, Egypt is advancing its green hydrogen ambitions with a $40
billion investment plan. Through various agreements with international
developers and the introduction of supportive laws including tax
credits, VAT exemptions and port fee reductions, Egypt is positioning
itself as a major green hydrogen exporter, particularly to Europe. The
country’s abundant solar and wind resources, combined with its
strategic location, make it a prime hub for green energy projects...

Last March, construction engineering companies SK Ecoplant and China
State Construction Engineering Corporation agreed to collaborate on a
$2 billion green hydrogen and ammonia facility in Egypt's Suez Canal
Economic Zone (SCZone). The project will harness 778 MW of renewable
energy —- 500 MW ofsolar and 278 MW of wind - to produce 50,000 tons
of green hydrogen and 250,000 tons of green ammonia annually. The
project is slated for completion by 2029"

Gov.uk: "Flush to Fuel; transforming wastewater into hydrogen
power.. Wastewater Fuels have developed an innovative solution to turn
sewage into sustainable hydrogen energy..

With the help of DASA funding, Wastewater Fuels have developed a
unique innovation to harness energy from wastewater. The system uses
stainless steel mesh rods in wastewater to break down organic material
into hydrogen ions which are converted into hydrogen gas and stored in
the rods. Proven through several trials, Wastewater Fuels is preparing
for the production of a full-scale sewage facility to be deployed at
RAF Digby"

1968 two term flag.. This is important esp. for this election, bcz '68
was like now, Dem party chaos, low net approval, started with one guy,
who did not run (shot), different guy ran, lost even though the party
was incumbent. With the data correction and some other changes, adv
goes to Reps.

Bill F-ing Clinton.. That spineless, poser, know-nothing
douchebag. All was done for the cameras.. for the show.

Fisk: "Every few months in the Middle East, the Chamberlain bell is
rung. 'Peace in our time,' it tolls. And anxious not to be blamed for
its failure, the Arabs and Israelis leap to express their support. The
moment Ehud Barak was elected Labour prime minister of Israel in 1999,
the satellite television boys and girls—along with the ever-supine BBC
World Service—were putting the 'peace process' back 'on track' once
more, even though Barak had made it clear that Jerusalem must remain
the united capital of Israel, that major Jewish settlements would stay
and that no Palestinian refugees from 1948 could expect to return to
their original Arab villages...

The pumpkin of the Oslo agreement could never be turned into the
golden carriage of peace, but it took the collapse of the Arafat–Barak
talks at Camp David in 2000 to prove this true. Even then, Clinton was
reduced to claiming that the Oslo negotiations were 'based' on UN
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338— which was not what Oslo said
at all - and even Arafat must have realised that the end had come when
Madeleine Albright made her preposterous offer of 'a sense of
sovereignty' over Muslim religious sites in Jerusalem. Only the silly
villages that Arafat might have controlled outside his would-be
capital would have 'virtually full sovereignty,' according to the
Americans. There then followed the wilfully misleading leaks to the
effect that Arafat had turned down 95 per cent of 'Palestine' — in
reality around 64 per cent of the 22 per cent of 'Palestine' that was
left. Barak would not give up Jerusalem or abandon the
settlements. Arafat would not make the 'concession' of ceding Israeli
control over all of Jerusalem. So the sons of Abraham acknowledged
what so many Israelis and Palestinians knew all along: that Oslo
didn’t work. Clinton predictably saw fit to praise the stronger of the
two parties; he spoke of Barak’s 'courage' and 'vision,' but merely of
Arafat’s commitment. So much for America’s role as 'honest broker' of
the Middle East peace"

Another issue w "spend until inflation do not tax" \#DumbMMT approach
is gov can spend, spend, spend and never see much inflation.
Inflation has to do with money given to all, in excess, and its
circulation creates inflation. In an unequal economy even direct aid
to citizens will end up with the rich, there will be no circulation,
ie no inflation. Direct aid will go to rent, Walmart purchases, a new
iPhone, money gone. It all ends up with big corp. Now the rich will
take that money, buy even more assets; more homes, buy more government
debt, Walmart will become a bigger behemoth. In a way the rich gets
paid twice, not only did they end up with the direct aid, they now
gobble up more assets, making more money with money.

Reuters: "Prabowo becomes Indonesia's eighth president.. from being a
former military commander.. to sweeping the polls and now leading the
country of 280 million people... In a wide-ranging speech lasting
about an hour, Prabowo said self-sufficiency for food was possible
within five years, while also pledging to become self-sufficient in
energy.

Prabowo also touched on foreign policy during his speech, saying
Indonesia was non-aligned on the global stage, but that he stood in
support of the Palestinian people and said Jakarta was ready to send
more aid to Gaza"

Doctorow: "Billionaires are why we can’t have nice things — a sensible

donors.

The source of billionaires’ power isn’t mysterious: it’s their
money. Take away the money, take away the power. With more than a
dozen states considering wealth taxes, we’re finally in a race to the
top, to see which state can attack the corrosive power of extreme
wealth most aggressively"

RULES BASED ORDER

Fisk: "I have sought in vain to discover the origin of our
journalistic use of the word 'settlements.' By its nature, the
expression is almost comforting. It has a permanence about it, a
notion of legality. Every human wants to 'settle,' to have a home. The
far more disturbing—and far more accurate—word for Israel’s
land-grabbing in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 is
colonising. Settlers are colonists. Almost all the Israelis in the
West Bank are living on someone else’s land. They may say that God
gave them the land, but those Palestinians who legally owned that
land— who had property deeds to prove it, since the British Mandate,
since the Ottoman empire—are not allowed to appeal to God. Successive
Israeli governments have supported this theft of property, and by
2003, 400,000 Israeli Jews were living in the occupied territories in
explicit violation of Article 49 of the Geneva Convention — which
states that 'the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of
its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'

In all the long, fruitless negotiations with the Palestinians, the
Israelis would always maintain that the return of any territory was
'giving' land for peace—as if the occupied territories were legally
Israeli property of which it could dispose if it was generously
minded. So it is important to recall that the policy of implanting
Jewish colonists on occupied Arab land since 1967 has been
consistently and enthusiastically supported by successive Israeli
governments"
