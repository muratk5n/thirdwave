It is depressing how often Bender & Koller 2020 is cited
incorrectly. My best guess as to why this is is that people writing
about whether or not LLMs 'understand' or 'are agents' have such
strongly held beliefs about what they want to be true..

[We are cited] in this string: 'Do modern LLMs have beliefs, desires,
and intentions?..'

But we are emphatically not writing about LLMs having beliefs, desires
and intentions. We were debunking claims that LLMs
'understand'. Inasmuch as their apparent understanding is part of what
misleads people into attributing beliefs, desires, and intentions to
them"

Jason Velazquez: "Where have all the websites gone?.. Somewhere
between the late 2000’s aggregator sites and the contemporary For You
Page, we lost our ability to curate the web. Worse still, we’ve
outsourced our discovery to corporate algorithms. Most of us did it in
exchange for an endless content feed... Who wouldn’t want a steady
stream of dopamine shots?

The rest of us, posters, amplifiers, and aggregators, traded our
discovery autonomy for a chance at fame and fortune. Not all, but
enough to change the social web landscape.

But that gold at the end of the rainbow isn’t for us. “Creator funds”
pull from a fixed pot. It’s a line item in a budget that doesn’t
change, whether one hundred or one million hands dip inside
it. Executives in polished cement floor offices, who you’ll never
meet, choose their winners and losers. And I’m guessing it’s not a
meritocracy-based system. They pick their tokens, round up their
shills, and stuff Apple Watch ads between them"

It is all disintegrating before our eyes.. Many things known as
"correct", "right" in the past 40+ years is getting crushed. Truly
sad.

The evidence was strong before, it is overwhelming now.

If homogeneity is gone, the Big Bang is gone. [Kaput](../../2022/10/the-big-bang.html#homogeneous).

The Guardian: "Newly discovered cosmic megastructure challenges
theories of the universe.. the size of the Big Ring appears to defy a
fundamental assumption in cosmology called the cosmological
principle. This states that above a certain spatial scale, the
universe is homogeneous and looks identical in every direction"

WAPO: "Prominent Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan has decided to quit
MSNBC rather than accept a demotion that saw him lose a regular Sunday
night program... The network had announced in November that Hasan
would lose his weekly show after three years but would remain as an
analyst and fill-in anchor.. U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar called it 'deeply
troubling that MSNBC is canceling his show amid a rampant rise of
anti-Muslim bigotry and suppression of Muslim voices'"

Tisdall, The Guardian: "Biden alienated global (and much American)
opinion by rashly pledging unconditional support to Israel after the
Hamas atrocities and vetoing UN ceasefire plans. His Middle East
policy looks outdated and out of touch. The US, never popular in the
Arab world, was tolerated as a necessary evil. No longer..

China and Russia are Iran’s new best friends. And it’s this, more than
other factors, that has transformed Iran’s fortunes, making it a power
to be reckoned with. The Ukraine invasion, and the prior Sino-Russian
'no limits' cooperation pact, was the catalyst for this transition"

AP News: "[2023/12] Since the war erupted on Oct. 7, at least 92
attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria have been claimed by an
umbrella group of Iran-backed Iraqi militants dubbed the Islamic
Resistance in Iraq. The militants say their attacks are in retaliation
for Washington’s backing of Israel and its military presence in Iraq
and Syria"
