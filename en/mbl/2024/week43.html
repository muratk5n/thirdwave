<p>You are not a fucking alien to your region of birth. We play
backgammon, <em>tavla</em> (<em>tavli</em> in Greek), the numbers on the dice are
read in Farsi - yek, do, se, chahar.. There are gazillions of yogurt
based dishes, similar in all countries around Medi / Aegan.  Döner /
gyro / shawarma is regional. Every migrant assimilates to their
region, adaps to its customs. The ones arriving starting 1000s had
already done so, locals, migrants (would-be locals) alike would accept
one of the religions of the geography, Islam. A "never-assimilating-unblemished migrant"
did not exist, nobody brough Islam from Central Asia, just like they did
not bring döner, or tavla from there.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Anglo benefited both from the first and the second use of this
alien identity. The second use was beneficial, the new Turkey wanted
to be an ally of the Anglo to protect itself against near and bigger
rivals, and its made up identity could be used to create chaos in
their backyard by claiming ethnic, cultural similarity with the Turkic
populations there. Plus the new Republic was basically declaring it
would never use influence in its old territories (it literally labeled
itself alien to them), so Anglo was assured it could run the roost
without any interference from "the Turks".</p>
<hr />
<p>Through the label "outsider Turk", a made up identity based on a
minority group who had long been assimilated into Anatolia, all of
Ottomans were made to look alien. We see this tall tale surfacing
again and again. Oddly enough after the war even the TR founders
started using the narrative, for them it made some tactical sense bcz
by then most of West Asia was gone, and now <em>they</em> wanted to isolate
themselves from the lost regions, indirectly from their past which was
deemed to be a bad influence, "an obstacle to reform". In essence TR
used the story from the opposite direction, they declared themselves
aliens, said "they never belonged" to their backward region anyway,
hoping now the people would "remember" their supposed adaptive,
migrant roots and now adapt to modern civilization which was their
stated aim. The only problem the national identity became a farce,
based on an incorrect reading of history. It brought marginal
benefits, but mostly created deep conflicts among the populace and its
elites, not to mention the still-present "Kurdish Problem".</p>

<p>Doctorow: "As important as the numbers revealed by the Secret IRS
Files were, I found the explanations even more interesting. The
99.9999% of us who never make contact with the secretive elite wealth
management and tax cheating industry know, in the abstract, that
there's something scammy going on in those esoteric cults of wealth
accumulation, but we're pretty vague on the details. When I pondered
the 'tax loopholes' that the rich were exploiting, I pictured, you
know, long lists of equations salted with Greek symbols, completely
beyond my ken.</p>
<p>But when Propublica's series laid these secret tactics out, I learned
that they were incredibly stupid ruses, tricks so thin that the only
way they could possibly fool the IRS is if the IRS just didn't give a
shit (and they truly didn't – after decades of cuts and attacks, the
IRS was far more likely to audit a family earning less than $30k/year
than a billionaire).</p>
<p>This has become a somewhat familiar experience. If you read the Panama
Papers, the Paradise Papers, Luxleaks, Swissleaks, or any of the other
spectacular leaks from the oligarch-industrial complex, you'll have
seen the same thing: the rich employ the most tissue-thin ruses, and
the tax authorities gobble them up. It's like the tax collectors don't

and that resulted in the bump-stock firearm ban, for only seven

business, people dying is good business too, other people will want to
buy more guns. If we look at both cases from the lens of citizens,
their unserved needs, politics, things make no sense. But once we

<p>Apple Machine Learning Research: "[W]e introduce GSM-Symbolic, an

questions. GSM-Symbolic enables more controllable evaluations,
providing key insights and more reliable metrics for measuring the
reasoning capabilities. [It] reveal[s] that LLMs exhibit noticeable
variance when responding to different instantiations of the same
question. Specifically, the performance of all models declines when
only the numerical values in the question are altered... Furthermore,
we investigate the fragility of mathematical reasoning in these models
and show that their performance significantly deteriorates as the
number of clauses in a question increases. We hypothesize that this
decline is because current LLMs cannot perform genuine logical
reasoning; they replicate reasoning steps from their training
data. Adding a single clause that seems relevant to the question
causes significant performance drops (up to 65%) across all
state-of-the-art models, even though the clause doesn't contribute to
the reasoning chain needed for the final answer"</p>

<p>Doctorow: "Of course we can tax billionaires.. They disguise their

rather, that it is technically impossible to tax the
ultra-rich. They’re not shy about explaining why, either — and neither
is their army of lickspittles...</p>
<p>Boy is this old trick getting old. It was already pretty thin when
Margaret Thatcher rolled it out, insisting that 'there is no
alternative' to her program of letting the rich get richer and the
poor go hungry. Dressing up a demand ('stop trying to think of
alternatives') as a scientific truth ('there is no alternative') sets
up a world where your opponents are Doing Ideology, while you’re doing
science.</p>
<p>Billionaires basically don’t pay tax — that’s a big part of how they
got to be billionaires.. By cheating on their taxes, they get to keep
— and invest — more money than less-rich people (who get to keep more
money than regular people and poor people, obvs). They get so much
money that they can 'invest' it in corrupting the political process,
for example, by flushing vast sums of dark money into elections to

<p>QM needs to be interfaced to probability and statistics. That way we
bring to bear all we know from those fields. We know samples,
distributions, random variables. Why can't we use those concepts
as-is? QM ppl have to deal with <em>negative probabilities</em>, this is
unheard of in the field of probability. QM is unmathematical, even
unscientific. It's just a collection of recipes. QM is science to the
extent a cookbook is science.</p>
<hr />
<p>Theory must assign stochasticity to the right place. I can stand at a
street corner with a notebook and ask everyone passing by their weight
and jot down the answer. When I plot the freq of all answers I get a
Gaussian curve. The stochasticity is in the world at large that
"randomly" sends people to my corner (in SED that would be the ZPF). I
take a look at that sample and find out the distribution, looking at
many data points. That is different than saying "noone has a weight
until I ask them". This is onthologically stupid.  Yet this is
precisely what people do with Copenhagen QM. They go further, let's
say before I ask the next guy any question, we throw dude in a box,
what is the man's weight? Well according to classical interp he is
both skinny and fat at the same time. </p>
<hr />
<p>SED makes the aether stochastic rather than the individual particle.</p>
<p>Cetto: "[To make QM work] physicists must renounce once and for all
the hope for a detailed description of the individual. Further, since
the concept of probability is being applied to a single event and no
sample space can be constructed, there is no consistent way of viewing
the result as a property of the system, and it must be interpreted as
an uncertainty of our knowledge. The observer slips thus into the
description, and the fundamental principle that physics refers to the
world rather than to our knowledge of it, is eroded."</p>

States; military personnel make up the majority of U.S. government
manpower; and military industry is a leading force in the
U.S. economy. As a result, other elements and capacities of the
U.S. government and civilian economy have been weakened, and military
industries have gained political power. Decades of high levels of
military spending have changed U.S. government and society –
strengthening its ability to fight wars, while weakening its
capacities to perform other core functions. Investments in
infrastructure, healthcare, education, and emergency preparedness, for
instance, have all suffered as military spending and industry have
crowded them out. Increased resources channeled to the military
further increase the political power of military industries, ensuring
that the cycle of economic dependence continues – militarized sectors

<p>Bill F-ing Clinton.. That spineless, poser, know-nothing

<p>Fisk: "Every few months in the Middle East, the Chamberlain bell is
rung. 'Peace in our time,' it tolls. And anxious not to be blamed for
its failure, the Arabs and Israelis leap to express their support. The
moment Ehud Barak was elected Labour prime minister of Israel in 1999,
the satellite television boys and girls—along with the ever-supine BBC
World Service—were putting the 'peace process' back 'on track' once
more, even though Barak had made it clear that Jerusalem must remain
the united capital of Israel, that major Jewish settlements would stay
and that no Palestinian refugees from 1948 could expect to return to
their original Arab villages...</p>
<p>The pumpkin of the Oslo agreement could never be turned into the
golden carriage of peace, but it took the collapse of the Arafat–Barak
talks at Camp David in 2000 to prove this true. Even then, Clinton was
reduced to claiming that the Oslo negotiations were 'based' on UN
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338— which was not what Oslo said
at all - and even Arafat must have realised that the end had come when
Madeleine Albright made her preposterous offer of 'a sense of
sovereignty' over Muslim religious sites in Jerusalem. Only the silly
villages that Arafat might have controlled outside his would-be
capital would have 'virtually full sovereignty,' according to the
Americans. There then followed the wilfully misleading leaks to the
effect that Arafat had turned down 95 per cent of 'Palestine' — in
reality around 64 per cent of the 22 per cent of 'Palestine' that was
left. Barak would not give up Jerusalem or abandon the
settlements. Arafat would not make the 'concession' of ceding Israeli
control over all of Jerusalem. So the sons of Abraham acknowledged
what so many Israelis and Palestinians knew all along: that Oslo
didn’t work. Clinton predictably saw fit to praise the stronger of the
two parties; he spoke of Barak’s 'courage' and 'vision,' but merely of
Arafat’s commitment. So much for America’s role as 'honest broker' of
the Middle East peace"</p>

<p>Another issue w "spend until inflation do not tax" #DumbMMT approach
is gov can spend, spend, spend and never see much inflation.
Inflation has to do with money given to all, in excess, and its
circulation creates inflation. In an unequal economy even direct aid
to citizens will end up with the rich, there will be no circulation,
ie no inflation. Direct aid will go to rent, Walmart purchases, a new
iPhone, money gone. It all ends up with big corp. Now the rich will
take that money, buy even more assets; more homes, buy more government
debt, Walmart will become a bigger behemoth. In a way the rich gets
paid twice, not only did they end up with the direct aid, they now
gobble up more assets, making more money with money.</p>

<p>Doctorow: "Billionaires are why we can’t have nice things — a sensible
climate policy, workers’ rights, a functional Supreme Court and
legislatures that answer to the people, rather than deep-pocketed
donors.</p>
<p>The source of billionaires’ power isn’t mysterious: it’s their
money. Take away the money, take away the power. With more than a
dozen states considering wealth taxes, we’re finally in a race to the
top, to see which state can attack the corrosive power of extreme
wealth most aggressively"</p>

<p>RULES BASED ORDER</p>
<p>Fisk: "I have sought in vain to discover the origin of our
journalistic use of the word 'settlements.' By its nature, the
expression is almost comforting. It has a permanence about it, a
notion of legality. Every human wants to 'settle,' to have a home. The
far more disturbing—and far more accurate—word for Israel’s
land-grabbing in the West Bank and Gaza since 1967 is
colonising. Settlers are colonists. Almost all the Israelis in the
West Bank are living on someone else’s land. They may say that God
gave them the land, but those Palestinians who legally owned that
land— who had property deeds to prove it, since the British Mandate,
since the Ottoman empire—are not allowed to appeal to God. Successive
Israeli governments have supported this theft of property, and by
2003, 400,000 Israeli Jews were living in the occupied territories in
explicit violation of Article 49 of the Geneva Convention — which
states that 'the Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of
its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.'</p>
<p>In all the long, fruitless negotiations with the Palestinians, the
Israelis would always maintain that the return of any territory was
'giving' land for peace—as if the occupied territories were legally
Israeli property of which it could dispose if it was generously
minded. So it is important to recall that the policy of implanting
Jewish colonists on occupied Arab land since 1967 has been
consistently and enthusiastically supported by successive Israeli
governments"</p>
