H2 Fuel News: "Daimler Truck and INEOS Inovyn collab on heavy duty
liquid hydrogen truck"

Lt. Col. Davis, *Armed Forces Journal*: "[2013] Over the past two
decades, Army generals have consistently insisted that various
acquisition, organizational and even combat efforts were on course
despite substantial and frequent expert testimony to the
contrary. They rejected alternative courses of action that independent
analysis suggested might have produced superior results, and reaped
failure after expensive failure.

A short and by no means exhaustive list of such failures might include
the RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter (launched in 1991,
canceled after $6.9 billion), the XM2001 Crusader mobile cannon
(launched in 1995, canceled after 7 billion), and the Future Combat
Systems (launched in 2003, canceled after 20 billion). FCS in
particular was notable for senior Army leaders’ efforts to ignore or
suppress the results of simulations, tests and analyses that
highlighted problems and ultimately predicted failure...

After each of these failures, one might expect the Army and program
leaders to have suffered censure. Instead, the opposite seems
generally to have been the case. The leaders of failed programs and
other efforts received prestigious medals, promotion to higher ranks,
and plum follow-on jobs; others retired and went to work for defense
contractors, often with companies that had profited from the failed
acquisition effort"

Bloomenergy: "Key Advantages of Hydrogen Fuel Cells.. 1) High Energy
Efficiency.. Hydrogen fuel cells outshine traditional energy sources
with their exceptional efficiency. Typically, internal combustion
engines operate at an efficiency rate of around 25%, while power
plants hover around 35%. In contrast, hydrogen fuel cells in a
combined heat and power system boast efficiencies greater than 60%,
according to the U.S. Department of Energy...

2) Environmental and Economic Benefits.. Emitting only water vapor and
heat, hydrogen fuel cells offer a zero-emission power source..

3) Versatility and Scalability.. Hydrogen, the universe’s most
abundant element, offers an inexhaustible energy resource that can
significantly contribute to global zero-carbon energy initiatives...

4) Reliability and Durability.. Fuel cells stand out for their
reliability and longevity. Unlike batteries that lose charge over
time, hydrogen stored as a gas or liquid remains ready for use,
ensuring a dependable energy source for critical
applications. Additionally, hydrogen fuel cells offer notable
operational durability, with some designs demonstrating lifespans
exceeding 20,000 hours. This reliability, coupled with the minimal
maintenance needs of fuel cell systems, positions hydrogen fuel cells
as a sustainable solution for long-term energy needs"

Beckett, The Guardian: "An ONS study of British inflation since 1950
found that, while its infamous surge in the 1970s was largely caused
by 'sharp increases in world prices for food and other commodities',
since 1989 'the biggest driver.. has typically been housing and
household services, which includes gas and electricity prices'. By
doing so much during the 1980s to create today’s property-obsessed,
profiteering economy, Margaret Thatcher did not 'defeat' British
inflation, as she promised, but made it worse in the long run
instead."

Critics can argue whether they dislike the decision or not. My point
is it was under the realm of executive authority which was exercised
in this case. It is not easy, next to impossible to run a "deep state"
in the current US system which is good actually. But at the same time
US politicians are regularly bought out who turn around and do the
bidding of the wealthy (that is not good). In other words US' problem
is the surface state - visible people, in high office making decisions
that are against the majority's interests.

Host: "Colonel what did you make of the scenes in the house as the
Ukrainian flags were waved in apparent celebration of of signing the
check to Ukraine"

Col MacGregor: "I don't think they were really waving flags for
Ukraine, they were expressing their gratitude to donors who will
reward them for voting for this terrible bill. Probably 60 to 70% of
the cash will never reach Ukraine it'll end up being circulated
through the giant laundering machine here in Washington that moves
funds to the Department of Defense, from the Department of Defense to
military industrial production, to clients, donors, and then
eventually parts of it end up back on the Hill in people's re-election
funds.

You have to understand that most of this isn't going to have any
impact whatsoever on the battlefield in Ukraine, Ukrainians are
running out of soldiers, at this point they're losing about 500 to 800
Ukrainian soldiers a day, and the Russian offensive hasn't really
begun yet. The place is nearing collapse but I guess the point is to
try and conceal from the American public and and from the rest of the
world yet gain the immense failure of this policy of proxy war with
Russia..

How did we get to this point?.. I think you know those of us who are
old enough.. have realized that there's money to be made in a time of
war, but it's so naked now, evolved.. to such a a morally bankrupt
state of affairs. I can't speak for what the population or the
electorate is like in Great Britain but here in the United States I
think large numbers of Americans have been very complacent and by
complacency I mean haven't taken much interest in foreign and defense
policy.  The average American thinks that if you spend a dollar on
defense you get a dollar of national security at the other end of the
process, that of course is nonsense, and they don't have a real feel
for how many billions of dollars are wasted on a daily basis by the
Department of Defense..

[Some] are beginning to figure out that they have no representation in
Washington, that the parties are irrelevant, we are supposedly
governed at the behest of two parties, but in truth we have one party
it's called the Uniparty which is why there were only 21 Republicans
who refused to support the bill. There is no representation.. there
are still [those] who think that the coming election could change
something, you would think by now they would have figured out that it
doesn't make much difference who you vote for you get the same bad
outcome"

"Plug Continues to Make Substantial Advancement in Hydrogen Generation
Buildout...  Plug Power Inc... a global leader in comprehensive
hydrogen solutions for the green hydrogen economy, has reached
nameplate capacity at the company’s hydrogen plants in Georgia and
Tennessee. With this increased supply from our hydrogen production
network, Plug will benefit from a lower cost of hydrogen, a crucial
step in the company’s roadmap to achieve profitable growth. This is
headlined by the company’s first green hydrogen plant in Georgia
already reaching nameplate capacity of 15 tons per day (TPD) of liquid
hydrogen production"

Basically they compute the Hubble constant two different ways, and
they came out different. One method relies on cosmic microwave
background from the so-called "Big Bang" the other from measuring
velocities and distances of galaxies. They thought the latter could
have been wrong (due to an older telescope) and hoped JWST would give
a results closer to the CMB one (which would rescue early universe
theories) that did not pan out. JWST confirmed the "tension", a fancy
word indicating cosmologist don't know what the f--k is going on
anymore. The CMB route includes a formula with "dark energy"
$\Lambda$, whose existence is in question. CMB's existence should be
too, along with Big Bang. The situation is pretty sad. Fundamental sci
is failing.

---

Paper: "Over the last decade an intriguing tension has emerged between
the value of the Hubble constant (H0) measured directly from redshifts
and distances, following its local definition and independent of
models, and the same parameter inferred from the cosmological model,
calibrated in the early Universe.. The James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) provides new capabilities to scrutinize and refine some of the
strongest observational evidence for this tension"

Said: "For the Israelis, there’s always this tendency to think of us
as aliens and therefore the fewer of us around the better, and the
best are those you don’t see at all….What’s so extraordinary is that
what the Israelis are now doing on the West Bank and Gaza is really
repeating the experience of apartheid and what the United States did
to the Native Americans. Put them in reservations or just exterminate
them, which the Israelis haven’t done, but put them as far aways as
possible, then the problem will go away.”

---

What a concidence, the school where Said taught becomes the center of
Gaza protest attention. Said, as many know, was originally
Palestinian, wrote many famous books on the subject and is also the
coiner / popularizer of the word Orientalism (published a book with
the same name). Isn't the way Israel dehumanizes, looks down on
Palestinians and describes them as such to foreign media a textbook
case of Orientalism?

Columbia University Student: "Last night we watched a screening of the
last lecture of Edward Said [who was a Columbia U professor]. I was
proud to come to this school because of the incredible history it had
of being at the forefront of thought, especially progressive thought,
and activism. I am disgusted by how the Columbia administration
handled the current situation... We are the continuation of a long
line of activism on this campus, from the war movements of Vietnam to
South African apartheid. And those students [who protested] are now
considered heroes, the university looks on them with pride. It's
really ironic those people are now venerated, and we are villified. We
are doing exactly the same thing"

facilities that can produce around 1 million tons a year of "blue”

Car Expert: "My local servo [gas station].. has eight liquid fuel
pumps and they can all be used simultaneously. The number of pumps is
not a random choice at any servo that number of pumps is there because
eight pumps in this case is the number that best services the peak
demand. Let us do a thought experiment.. transition to Electric Utopia
where the eight pumps are now eight rechargers all capable of pumping
50 kwatt hours into 8 EVS in just 5 minutes [an impossibility on its
own] Hallelujah.. what could possibly go    wrong? I'd suggest here's
what could go wrong: that's 400 kwatt hours of energy in 5 minutes,
think about that another way it's 400 kwatt hours delivered in 1/12th
of an hour which is uh 5 megawatt, more or less, to run one shitty
little suburban servo. Imagine rolling that out nationally to every
station.. [it] is just a preposterous infrastructure challenge"

TNR: "[A 2022 book *The Network State: How to Start a New Country*]..
outlines a plan for tech plutocrats to exit democracy and establish
new sovereign territories. I mentioned [its] ideas in two previous
stories about Network State–related efforts in California—a proposed
tech colony called California Forever and the tech-funded campaign to
capture San Francisco’s government...

'What I’m really calling for is something like tech Zionism,' [author]
said, after comparing his movement to those started by.. Theodor Herzl
('spiritual father' of the state of Israel).. . then revealed
his shocking ideas for a tech-governed city where citizens loyal to
tech companies would form a new political tribe clad in gray
t-shirts. 'And if you see another Gray on the street … you do the
nod,' he said, during a four-hour talk on the Moment of Zen
podcast. 'You’re a fellow Gray.'.. Grays would also receive special ID
cards providing access to exclusive, Gray-controlled sectors of the
city. In addition, the Grays would make an alliance with the police
department, funding weekly 'policeman’s banquets' to win them over"

Declassified UK: "UK military support for Israel’s genocide was
pre-planned.. In aiding Israel’s mass attacks on Palestinians in Gaza,
Britain is implementing an agreement openly signed with Netanyahu’s
far-right coalition – which has been almost entirely ignored in the UK
national media.

It explicitly states the two countries are 'natural allies' – ignoring
Israel’s pariah status among much of the rest of the world due its
illegal occupation of the West Bank and “apartheid” system
discriminating against Palestinians.

Notably, the Roadmap has a section entitled 'Antisemitism,
delegitimisation, and anti-Israel bias' whose wording directly
prophesies Britain’s extraordinary apologias for Israel’s Gaza
atrocities in international fora.

It calls for 'tackling the disproportionate focus on Israel in the UN
and other international bodies, including attempts to delegitimise it
or deny its right to self-defence. All states have a duty to comply
with their obligations under international law, but scrutiny must be
measured, impartial and proportionate'"
