NYT: "Hydrogen Offers Germany a Chance to Take a Lead in Green
Energy.. A subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp, Germany‚Äôs venerable steel
producer, is landing major deals for a device that makes the
clean-burning gas from water.

ThyssenKrupp Nucera.. produces the electrolyzers. The company was spun
off from ThyssenKrupp, a German steel giant, in 2023.

The Nucera project was backed by a German government fund worth 700
million euros, or $746 million. Overall, German state and federal
governments have earmarked ‚Ç¨13.2 billion for investment in about two
dozen projects to develop hydrogen...

Inflation Reduction Act, the 2022 law.. is offering hundreds of
billions of dollars for carbon-free, or green, technology. The
Department of Energy awarded Nucera a $50 million grant last month to
further develop production of gigawatt-scale electrolyzers for North
America...

ThyssenKrupp‚Äôs grab bag of businesses was a world-leading supplier of
equipment for making chlorine, a chemical with many uses including in
drinking water and swimming pools. As it turns out, new iterations of
these machines can be used to make hydrogen"

Post-Gilded Age worker-centric concessions people had from the wealthy
were not taken, they were *given* by the wealthy class
itself. Naturally they did not do it out of the goodness of their
hearts, they were scared. A new system was on the rise (communism),
the business elite felt they had to do something to stop that from
happening in US, so they gave to regular folk as many concessions as
they could without losing their own shirt. As such the concessions
were not permanent. Post 70s/80s saw corporations, the wealthy class
to reclaim their top status with a vengaence. If changes are made now,
they need to be made permanent. The class in power needs to be beaten
down. Power needs to be *taken*.

It is like "the invisible hand" phenomenon in econ. Just like the
combined actions of simple consumers with purchasing power seemingly
creates a direction that looks almost planned, the combined actions of
larger econ individuals (plutocrats) will create a direction as
well. No specific fluffermucker is in charge, in a way all of them
are. In their case their purchasing power is larger, they can purchase
entire politicians, small-size countries, pay off high-ranking
officials, brain-wash the public through their media. That will create
certain type of dynamic in governance.

---

Plutocracies are hard to identify, they are hard to pin down. There
are bunch of private actors working the system from many
angles... Countries with militocratic history cannot fathom bunch of
rich, connected jagoffs running roughshod this way, some oligarchs can
get powerful, but the state can kick their ass, as it happened in
Russia recently. But in US/UK, they've been in charge for centuries.

"Studying government" at uni won't help here because a lot of that
scholarship, teaching is Eurasia centric, going all the way back to
Plato, around regions that have been dominated by military empires
(real ones, not the McFuckFauxEmpire of US). There is some General X,
General Y, someone makes a coup, gets power. There is unrest in the
empire, soldiers get sent to quell, done. Bada bing bada boom. *A
company* having an army larger than the country it originates from (eg
the East India Company) is almost unheard of.

Turchin, *Age of Discord*: "When [the Soviet Union] collapsed in 1991,
[govs] huge capital ‚Äãwas rapidly privatized by corporate managers‚Äîparty
bosses, factory directors, and their cronies... Privatization was an
incredibly corrupt and violent process, with the winners literally
walking on the corpses of their less lucky competitors. In a darkly
amusing anecdote, at a meeting between the two most powerful Russian
oligarchs, Berezovsky and Gusinsky, one of them reportedly asked the
other: 'Why did you put a contract on me?' The response? 'No, it was
you who put a contract on me!' It turns out that each had hired
assassins to eliminate the other.

As most of the wealth became concentrated in the hands of fewer than a
dozen oligarchs, the well-being of the 99 percent collapsed. Russians
were dying in droves from deaths of despair. By 1996, popular
discontent became so intense that it was clear the incumbent
president, Boris Yeltsin, had no chance of winning reelection - his
approval ratings were in the single digits. The main challenger was
the communist Gennady Zyuganov. The oligarchate became concerned that
victory by the communists might create difficulties for their
continued looting of the country. A group of the most powerful
oligarchs, led by Berezovsky and Gusinsky, made a deal with Yeltsin:
in return for his guaranteeing the privatization of state enterprises,
they financed his campaign and threw their media resources behind
him‚Äîby that point, they controlled all mass media. They also hired a
team of American political campaign consultants (including the
infamous Dick Morris [Clinton's advisor]) to manage Yeltsin‚Äôs
reelection. Even that was not enough, and in the end they had to
resort to massive electoral fraud to reelect Yeltsin.

This is how Russia became an extreme plutocracy in 1996. Because the
oligarchs had little regard for managing the state, the disintegrative
processes gathered speed. The factory owners stopped paying their
workers‚Äô salaries, and there was a wave of labor strikes during the
autumn following the elections. A bloody war in Chechnya flared up
again. ‚ÄãAnd in 1998, the country was hit by a severe financial crisis,
which resulted in the devaluation of the ruble and a default on the
state debt.

At this point, two main power networks formed in Russia. The ruling
faction was the economic elites (the oligarchs), who thoroughly
controlled the ideological elites by owning all major mass media. The
second group included the administrative elites (the bureaucracy) and
the military elites (the so-called *siloviki*, who included state
security and military officers). In the ensuing power struggle, the
alliance of administrative/military elites, led by Vladimir Putin,
defeated the plutocrats. There was no sudden revolution; rather, the
process was gradual, as one oligarch after another was exiled
(Berezovsky and Gusinsky), imprisoned and then exiled (Khodorkovsky),
or relegated to a subordinate position in the power hierarchy
(Potanin)"

Renewables Now: "[Study conducted] Uniper Energy Storage has indicated
strong interest in hydrogen storage in North West Germany even in the
initial phase of hydrogen ramp-up starting in 2029 and beyond.. Uniper
noted that according to a recent study by the association Gas
Infrastructure Europe, achieving the REPowerEU targets will require
hydrogen storage capacity of around 45 TWh in Europe by 2030 and
around 300 TWh by 2050, well above the planned projects of 9 TWh by
2030 and 21.5 TWh by 2050"

Clarkson is the former host of *Top Gear* the famous car enthusiast

Kicked off to spoon-feed a Democratic president his legacy, it limped on
for a while due to US being a tech trendsetter, but it finally crashed
into the wall called *reality* and is about the meet its inescapable end.

Jeremy Clarkson: "It took me about 15 minutes to work out that electric
cars were rubbish. But when I said so, on television, I was called a
climate change denier, luddite and fool. So you can imagine how happy
I was yesterday to discover that millions of people are now coming
round to my way of thinking.

In Germany, electric car sales fell in March by a whopping 29 per
cent. And across the rest of the EU by 11 per cent. In the UK.. the
share of the market taken by battery-powered cars is down from
16.6‚Ääper cent last year to 15.2 per cent in 2024. Things are so bleak
that Tesla is laying off 14,000 people globally. That‚Äôs ten per cent
of its workforce.

Some say this is all because governments are reducing the tax breaks
given. But it‚Äôs mostly because people are waking up to the fact
electric cars are expensive, boring to drive, useless for long
journeys and, if we are honest, not especially good for the
environment"

Lt. Col. Davis, *Armed Forces Journal*: "[2013] Over the past two
decades, Army generals have consistently insisted that various
acquisition, organizational and even combat efforts were on course
despite substantial and frequent expert testimony to the
contrary. They rejected alternative courses of action that independent
analysis suggested might have produced superior results, and reaped
failure after expensive failure.

A short and by no means exhaustive list of such failures might include
the RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter (launched in 1991,
canceled after $6.9 billion), the XM2001 Crusader mobile cannon
(launched in 1995, canceled after 7 billion), and the Future Combat
Systems (launched in 2003, canceled after 20 billion). FCS in
particular was notable for senior Army leaders‚Äô efforts to ignore or
suppress the results of simulations, tests and analyses that
highlighted problems and ultimately predicted failure...

After each of these failures, one might expect the Army and program
leaders to have suffered censure. Instead, the opposite seems
generally to have been the case. The leaders of failed programs and
other efforts received prestigious medals, promotion to higher ranks,
and plum follow-on jobs; others retired and went to work for defense
contractors, often with companies that had profited from the failed
acquisition effort"

Bloomenergy: "Key Advantages of Hydrogen Fuel Cells.. 1) High Energy
Efficiency.. Hydrogen fuel cells outshine traditional energy sources
with their exceptional efficiency. Typically, internal combustion
engines operate at an efficiency rate of around 25%, while power
plants hover around 35%. In contrast, hydrogen fuel cells in a
combined heat and power system boast efficiencies greater than 60%,
according to the U.S. Department of Energy...

2) Environmental and Economic Benefits.. Emitting only water vapor and
heat, hydrogen fuel cells offer a zero-emission power source..

3) Versatility and Scalability.. Hydrogen, the universe‚Äôs most
abundant element, offers an inexhaustible energy resource that can
significantly contribute to global zero-carbon energy initiatives...

4) Reliability and Durability.. Fuel cells stand out for their
reliability and longevity. Unlike batteries that lose charge over
time, hydrogen stored as a gas or liquid remains ready for use,
ensuring a dependable energy source for critical
applications. Additionally, hydrogen fuel cells offer notable
operational durability, with some designs demonstrating lifespans
exceeding 20,000 hours. This reliability, coupled with the minimal
maintenance needs of fuel cell systems, positions hydrogen fuel cells
as a sustainable solution for long-term energy needs"

Beckett, The Guardian: "An ONS study of British inflation since 1950
found that, while its infamous surge in the 1970s was largely caused
by 'sharp increases in world prices for food and other commodities',
since 1989 'the biggest driver.. has typically been housing and
household services, which includes gas and electricity prices'. By
doing so much during the 1980s to create today‚Äôs property-obsessed,
profiteering economy, Margaret Thatcher did not 'defeat' British
inflation, as she promised, but made it worse in the long run
instead."

Critics can argue whether they dislike the decision or not. My point
is it was under the realm of executive authority which was exercised
in this case. It is not easy, next to impossible to run a "deep state"
in the current US system which is good actually. But at the same time
US politicians are regularly bought out who turn around and do the
bidding of the wealthy (that is not good). In other words US' problem
is the surface state - visible people, in high office making decisions
that are against the majority's interests.

Host: "Colonel what did you make of the scenes in the house as the
Ukrainian flags were waved in apparent celebration of of signing the
check to Ukraine"

Col MacGregor: "I don't think they were really waving flags for
Ukraine, they were expressing their gratitude to donors who will
reward them for voting for this terrible bill. Probably 60 to 70% of
the cash will never reach Ukraine it'll end up being circulated
through the giant laundering machine here in Washington that moves
funds to the Department of Defense, from the Department of Defense to
military industrial production, to clients, donors, and then
eventually parts of it end up back on the Hill in people's re-election
funds.

You have to understand that most of this isn't going to have any
impact whatsoever on the battlefield in Ukraine, Ukrainians are
running out of soldiers, at this point they're losing about 500 to 800
Ukrainian soldiers a day, and the Russian offensive hasn't really
begun yet. The place is nearing collapse but I guess the point is to
try and conceal from the American public and and from the rest of the
world yet gain the immense failure of this policy of proxy war with
Russia..

How did we get to this point?.. I think you know those of us who are
old enough.. have realized that there's money to be made in a time of
war, but it's so naked now, evolved.. to such a a morally bankrupt
state of affairs. I can't speak for what the population or the
electorate is like in Great Britain but here in the United States I
think large numbers of Americans have been very complacent and by
complacency I mean haven't taken much interest in foreign and defense
policy.  The average American thinks that if you spend a dollar on
defense you get a dollar of national security at the other end of the
process, that of course is nonsense, and they don't have a real feel
for how many billions of dollars are wasted on a daily basis by the
Department of Defense..

[Some] are beginning to figure out that they have no representation in
Washington, that the parties are irrelevant, we are supposedly
governed at the behest of two parties, but in truth we have one party
it's called the Uniparty which is why there were only 21 Republicans
who refused to support the bill. There is no representation.. there
are still [those] who think that the coming election could change
something, you would think by now they would have figured out that it
doesn't make much difference who you vote for you get the same bad
outcome"

Basically they compute the Hubble constant two different ways, and
they came out different. One method relies on cosmic microwave
background from the so-called "Big Bang" the other from measuring
velocities and distances of galaxies. They thought the latter could
have been wrong (due to an older telescope) and hoped JWST would give
a results closer to the CMB one (which would rescue early universe
theories) that did not pan out. JWST confirmed the "tension", a fancy
word indicating cosmologist don't know what the f--k is going on
anymore. The CMB route includes a formula with "dark energy"
$\Lambda$, whose existence is in question. CMB's existence should be
too, along with Big Bang. The situation is pretty sad. Fundamental sci
is failing.

---

Paper: "Over the last decade an intriguing tension has emerged between
the value of the Hubble constant (H0) measured directly from redshifts
and distances, following its local definition and independent of
models, and the same parameter inferred from the cosmological model,
calibrated in the early Universe.. The James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) provides new capabilities to scrutinize and refine some of the
strongest observational evidence for this tension"

Declassified UK: "UK military support for Israel‚Äôs genocide was
pre-planned.. In aiding Israel‚Äôs mass attacks on Palestinians in Gaza,
Britain is implementing an agreement openly signed with Netanyahu‚Äôs
far-right coalition ‚Äì which has been almost entirely ignored in the UK
national media.

It explicitly states the two countries are 'natural allies' ‚Äì ignoring
Israel‚Äôs pariah status among much of the rest of the world due its
illegal occupation of the West Bank and ‚Äúapartheid‚Äù system
discriminating against Palestinians.

Notably, the Roadmap has a section entitled 'Antisemitism,
delegitimisation, and anti-Israel bias' whose wording directly
prophesies Britain‚Äôs extraordinary apologias for Israel‚Äôs Gaza
atrocities in international fora.

It calls for 'tackling the disproportionate focus on Israel in the UN
and other international bodies, including attempts to delegitimise it
or deny its right to self-defence. All states have a duty to comply
with their obligations under international law, but scrutiny must be
measured, impartial and proportionate'"
