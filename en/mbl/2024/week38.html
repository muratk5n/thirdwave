generally bar lobbyists from playing a significant role in organizing
or participating in trips sponsored by corporate entities. Such free

<p>None of these restrictions, however, applies to nonprofits such as the
Congressional Institute, which regularly arranges multiday trips to

with private-sector institute members who pay as much as $27,500

<p>MCU did not know how to handle Thor, he was like a hot potato for
them. Thor's Asgard culture is a militocracy, the first excellent
movie shows it in its glory. The movie did great. But then mind
manipulators had to bring Thor down a notch. He was made fat, cucked,
made fool of, in multiple movies. They even had the warrior girl
pining for him lose interest and cuck others. It was a chain
cuck. Then Asgard was destroyed. Hemsworth is a good sport, he rolled
with it all, still coming out looking good, but Marv certainly
tried. If Thor was a budding businessman, an enterpreneur, even better
anti-government enterpreneur, he would be great, he would never be
cucked.</p>

perhaps? Which character would that be? Maybe they'll have a Stark

<p>We need to note Napoleon was a <em>military</em> leader in the mold of other
military leaders in Europe. As Turchin says "medieval militocracies
gradually evolved into ruling classes that combined military and
administrative functions". He was not a <em>plutocrat</em>, did not
descend from a culture thinking of "bottom lines", "maximizing
profits" in that by following these precepts blindly benefits would
come to society, flowers would bloom and cows would fly. We see what
is happening to places that inherit their admin from those, basically
the Anglo-land who are currently in a process of quite implosion.</p>

<p>Kuznick, <em>The Untold History of the US</em>: "Although U.S. involvement in
the First World War had been relatively brief and, by most measures,
enormously successful, the nature of the fighting, marked by trench
and chemical warfare, and the shaky postwar settlement combined to
undermine the glory of the war itself. In its aftermath, Americans
became increasingly disillusioned. A war fought to make the world safe
for democracy seemed to have failed in its purpose. Nor was there much
hope that this war would end all wars. Though some people nevertheless
clung to the belief that the United States had engaged in a great
crusade for freedom and democracy, for others the phrase rang
hollow. A postwar literature of disillusionment emerged in the works
of E. E. Cummings, John Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound,
Thomas Boyd, William Faulkner, Laurence Stallings, Irwin Shaw, Ford
Madox Ford, Dalton Trumbo, and other writers as the nation learned
once again that the initial euphoria of war would be erased by the
reality of what the war actually achieved"</p>

<p>During covid money was printed and given to people. What happened
later? It ended up with big corp, inequality increased, meaning the
wealthy will still buy your assets, own your debt, charge you rent,

front in center, not create bizarre drama around

time, just like battery electric cars are for climate change.</p>
<hr />
<p>MMT is the tail-end, fringe part of the neolib strategy. The grand
narrative is being for "sound money" while printing it for the
rich. Media already works for them, opposition is silenced. Once in a
while though they throw the oppo a bone, via MMT this time "you could
print until you see inflation, you know", wink wink, an approach that
will never become policy, but it gives the fools hope, keeps them
occupied. That way noone talks about taxing the rich.</p>

<p>TDB: "A gunman crawled through shrubbery near Donald Trump’s golf
course in West Palm Beach, Florida, Sunday afternoon, coming within
500 yards of the former president, authorities said. Ryan Wesley
Routh, 58, was hiding with the barrel of his AK-47-style rifle poking
through a fence when it was spotted by a Secret Service agent.. “With
a rifle and scope, like, that is not a long distance,” Palm Beach
County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday
afternoon"</p>

<p>Kursk incursion reversal is happening as fast as it advanced. That
makes sense bcz the speed of the advance had to do with the geographic
character of the place and same is true of the reversion. The areas
captured by UA were sparsely populated, not fortifed (unlike Donbas)
so Ukraine seemingly gained lots of territory, incredibly fast. Now it
is losing them as fast as they were gained. Easy come, easy go.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wars can be fought within democracies.. But recent events outed a
dirty little secret, Ukraine has never been a democracy, in large part
thanks to the Americans.</p>
<hr />
<p>Zelensk term ran out months ago. New elections have to be called if
the current gov can remain legitimate. Where are they? Aren't we
defending democracy? Apparently there isn't any in Ukraine!</p>

<p>Fleming: "There are four.. observations, which are considered to be
proofs of General Relativity.. The first is the change in the time
rate of clocks in a gravitational field, the second is gravitational
redshift, the third is the Shapiro Delay, and the fourth is the
bending of light...</p>
<p>[Bending of light] has never been an issue of space contraction, but
rather the speed of light being reduced near bodies of matter. This is
the same conclusion, the speed of light changing, reached by Paul
Marmet who did an excellent job cataloging the difficulties involved
with measuring the Shapiro Delay and the bending of light... The
Shapiro Delay is due to the reduction in light velocity due to photon
deceleration/acceleration and increased London-van der Waals
torque.. Gravitational redshift is due to a decrease in energy as a
photon accelerates away from a star.. The final piece of the frame
transformation puzzle is the time rate change of clocks... this
phenomenon is not a time dilation of space, but simply a change in
clock rate due to the kinetic energy due to the velocity of a physical
clock relative to the universal rest frame"</p>

<p>RU did not divert mil resources from Donbas, did not bother the op
there. According to news the governor of Tula was given the job to
stop the incursion in Kursk.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kursk incursion is being rolled back. Massive gains in the East.</p>
