PV Magazine: "The US Department of Energy's Hydrogen and Fuel Cell
Technologies Office (HFTO) has published a detailed strategy and
planning document that will help guide hydrogen innovation and
research in the coming years. It outlines HFTO's mission, goals, and
strategic approach, said the Department of Energy. The document aims
for 'clean' hydrogen production costs of $2/kg by 2026 and 1/kg by
2031, but also electrolyzer system cost of 250 dollars/kW
(low-temperature electrolyzers) and 500 dollars/kW (high-temperature
electrolyzers) by 2026."

Robitaille: "Have Astronomers Assigned a Signal Produced by the Oceans
to the Cosmos?.. In 1965, Penzias and Wilson detected a strong
microwave signal surrounding the Earth. They ascribed a temperature of
3.5 K to the source, and the cosmology community immediately
attributed the signal to the primordial explosion. According to
astrophysicists, Penzias and Wilson had discovered a remnant of the
Big Bang and the central pillar of modern cosmology. Yet, Kirchhoff’s
Law of Thermal emission states that, in order to ascribe a temperature
from a blackbody spectrum, the source must be in thermal equilibrium
within an opaque enclosure. This was clearly not the case for the Big
Bang....

[We argue] that the monopole of the background arises from the
hydrogen bond in water on Earth. Images of nuclear explosions [can] be
viewed in order to help establish that the surface of the oceans, when
undergoing shock compression, manifest the hexagonal planar structure
associated with graphite and soot, some of the best blackbodies
known. Water has the ability to both absorb and emit microwaves and it
is likely that the surface of water maintains hexagonal planar
structure with ability to emit in the microwave. Penzias and Wilson
should have detected a signal from the Earth itself, but they did
not. This is because they erroneously participated in assigning the
monopole of the microwave background to the universe"

---

How could this "afterglow of the Big Bang" be aligned with our puny
little solar system? The answer: CMB originates from our solar system!
It has nothing to do with some dubious theory about the beginning of
the universe.

---

Wiki: "The 'axis of evil' is a name given to the apparent correlation
between the plane of the Solar System and aspects of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). It gives the plane of the Solar System and
hence the location of Earth a greater significance than might be
expected by chance"

*End Times*: "[T]he American ruling class continues to be very
effective at advancing its narrow, short-term, parochial
interests. With every piece of tax legislation, the tax code is
becoming more regressive; today the effective taxes on corporations
and billionaires are at the lowest levels since the 1920s. By
successfully arguing that money is 'free speech', corporations have
largely dismantled constraints on using their wealth to shape American
politics. The federal minimum wage continues to decline in real terms,
despite inflation reaching levels not seen since the 1980s. The
disagreements between the conservatives and the progressives within
the ruling class focus almost entirely on cultural issues. The
economic elites, who dominate the American polity, can tolerate a
great diversity of views on such issues, as long as the consensus on
promoting their collective economic interests (keeping their taxes and
worker wages low) is strong"

Scientists K. Batygin and Michael Brown worked on this subject for a
long time, they tirelessly promoted their Planet 9 theories. Mike
Brown BTW is the scientist who killed Pluto as a planet (it wasn't
Neil Foei Gras Tyson).

---

Planet 9 explains the peculiar orbits of our solar system, if there is
an object where they think it is, it would pull on the other objects
in a certain way and simulations show our current orbits make more
sense that way.

---

Wiki: "[T]his hypothetical super-Earth-sized planet would have had a
predicted mass of five to ten times that of the Earth, and an
elongated orbit 400 to 800 times farther from the Sun than the Earth
is"

planet in our solar system.. New findings represent the ‘strongest
statistical evidence yet’ that Planet 9 exists"

Wheels.ph: "Great Wall Motors has been studying hydrogen energy for
more than 20 years now. It’s only in 2019 when they created FTXT
Energy as their arm focused on exploring the development of hydrogen
fuel cells as means of mobility. Aside from China, they also have R&D
centers in Canada, Japan, and Germany. FTXT says they are now in the
commercialization phase of hydrogen fuel cells... We’re bummed with
the hours it takes for an electric car to charge. There are
fast-charging options but we can’t use them all the time because it
will hurt the performance and longevity of the batteries.. [another]
advantage of hydrogen is weather. Electric vehicles have a performance
disadvantage in cold weather since their batteries can’t reach their
optimum temperature. Hydrogen doesn’t have that issue and will work
well on both ends of the thermometer"

Weinersmith, *A City on Mars*: "[T]he Martian surface is
poisonous. Perchlorates, a class of chemicals found in trace levels on
Earth, make up 0.5 to 1.0 percent of Martian surface
soil.. perchlorates are a pretty nasty chemical. At high doses, they
cause thyroid problems by competing with the iodine ions your body
needs to produce certain hormones. This is probably not good,
especially for developing fetuses and children.. When people talk
about space, they are often weirdly generous to conditions they would
never accept on Earth. Imagine you’re planning to have kids and are
looking to buy a homestead. How do you feel about a real estate agent
saying, 'It’s a great location, but I should mention the surface
contains high levels of chemicals that are dangerous for children. And
those chemicals can get taken up by edible plants, so if I were you
I’d convert those perchlorates to oxygen before you put in the veggie
patch'..

Martian dust is also more active than moondust. In 1971, as the first
Mars orbiter, Mariner 9, approached its target planet, something
happened ​that surprised the scientists. The red surface of Mars seemed
to resolve itself into featureless smoothness—apparently a flat disk
where a sphere was supposed to be. It turned out the entire planet,
except for bits at the poles and the tall volcanic peaks, was
enveloped in a single massive dust storm. Impressively, from the
perspective of human discomfort, these dust storms occur even though
the atmosphere is quite thin—just about 1 percent of Earth pressure,
almost entirely made of carbon dioxide. The net result here is that if
you step outside, you still die about as quickly as you would on the
Moon, but also from time to time the sky is blotted out by killer
toxic dirt"

Gaza.. [relied] on data collected by Frank Luntz, a veteran Republican
pollster and pundit... The Luntz-tested presentations on the war in
Gaza urge politicians to avoid trumpeting America’s supposedly shared
democratic values with Israel, and focus instead on deploying 'The
Language of War with Hamas.' According to this framing, they must
deploy incendiary language painting Hamas as a 'brutal and
savage.. organization of hate' which has 'raped women,' while
insisting Israel is engaged in 'a war for humanity'...

Initiated at Israel’s United Nations mission in December 2023 with
speeches by neoliberal tech oligarch Sheryl Sandberg and former US

thousands of dollars in donations and speaking fees from Israel lobby
organizations, Tel Aviv’s propaganda blitz has yet to produce a single

PSI is proportional to youth bulge $A_{20-29}$, also urbanization

PSI is inversely related to $\epsilon$, elite munee, and directly

stress, decreasing elite munee increase stress too.. Binness starts
going bad for the top, they cause trouble within society.

Documentary: "Prime Minister Rabin [started a] peace process with the

time leader of the right-wing Likud party attacked Rabin for signing
the Accords he compared the [talks] to the 1938 Munich agreement in
which the British government seated parts of Czechoslovakia to
Hitler's Germany.  'You are worse than Chamberlain' Netanyahu said to
Rabin in the Israeli Knesset 'he endangered another nation but you are
doing it to your own nation'. Netanyahu regularly appeared at
anti-Rabin rallies as the right-wing protesters burned effigies of
Rabin they shouted 'Death to Rabin' and 'with blood and fire we will
banish Rabin'. The crowds even started to harass Rabin outside his
residence they went so far as to target Rabin's wife Leia, taunting
her with shouts like 'you will be strung up like Mussolini'.. The
protests were so extreme the other leaders within Netanyahu's Likud
party became squirmish and abandoned the rallies but not Netanyahu who
continued to show up and stay at anti-Rabin protests, he did not
flinch and continued to make speeches adding further fuel to the
flames. After Yesak Rabin was assassinated by a right-wing extremist,
everyone within the Israeli media knew the responsibility Netanyahu
bore in creating the climate of hate and fear that led to the death of
their prime minister"
