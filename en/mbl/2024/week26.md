Doctorow: "After 40 years of expanded copyright, we have a creative
industry that's larger and more profitable than ever, and yet the
share of income going to creative workers has been in steady decline
over that entire period. Every year, the share of creative income that
creative workers can lay claim to declines, both proportionally and in
real terms..

As with the mystery of Spotify's payments, this isn't a mystery at
all. You just need to understand that when creators are stuck
bargaining with a tiny, powerful cartel of movie, TV, music,
publishing, streaming, games or app companies, it doesn't matter how
much copyright they have to bargain with. Giving a creative worker
more copyright is like giving a bullied schoolkid more
lunch-money. There's no amount of money that will satisfy the bullies
and leave enough left over for the kid to buy lunch. They just take
everything"

This is the framing Apple wants to sell for their decision to withhold
features from the EU, and blogs are parroting it.

In reality, Apple is purposefully withholding these features from the
EU, either because Apple are being retaliatory against EU customers
for the existence of the DMA, or because Apple (with full knowledge of
the DMA for years) refused to build these features in compliance with
it.

Apple chose to harm their products in the EU. The DMA didn't. This
framing is marketing"

with fire extinguishers, he said, the workers rushed to an area of the
floor where there was no exit...

Workers who fled the fire said it started when a single battery cell
caught fire, triggering a series of explosions among some of the
35,000 lithium battery cells stored on the factory‚Äôs second
floor.. Fires can occur in lithium batteries when the inside layers
are compressed, causing a short circuit. The layers can become
compressed by a sudden impact, such as during a vehicle collision, or
by gradual swelling of the batteries through regular use...  Lithium
battery fires have been a growing problem in the United States and
elsewhere, and fires are an industrywide concern for battery
manufacturers...

The blaze was the deadliest in South Korea since a fire at a
construction site southeast of Seoul killed 38 people in 2020"

Truthdig: "I.. [read] peer-reviewed publications arguing.. addiction
with opioid prescriptions never really happens. My medical school
years (2005-2009) saw a blizzard of such academic papers, all claiming
that we could relax and start slinging product. Hundreds of those
papers ‚Äî 439, to be exact‚Äî cited for their evidence one mysterious
paper, published in the¬†New England Journal of Medicine... [That paper
enjoyed] glowing write-ups in mainstream media. TIME magazine called
it a 'landmark study,' one that showed fears of opioid addiction had
been 'exaggerated,' and were 'basically unwarranted.' Scientific
American¬†said Porter & Jick‚Äôs 'extensive study' was evidence for a new
modern understanding that 'morphine taken for pain is not
addictive.'....

The letter‚Äôs authors were Jane Porter, a grad student, and Hershel
Jick, a physician. Porter and Jick reported reviewing 11,000 patients
in 'our current files' at a Boston hospital who got treated with an
opioid and finding only four cases of 'reasonably well-documented
addiction', whatever any of that means. As evidence goes, it‚Äôs so
low-quality for decision-making purposes that it borders on
useless... Many years later, unscrupulous pharmaceutical companies
dusted off this [paper].. Their marketing departments had come up with
a clever use for it. They would claim that addiction happens far less
than 1% of the time (four cases out of 11,000 would be 0.036%). They
would cite¬†The New England Journal of Medicine. Then they would grin
slyly, because no one ever reads the footnotes"

A major problem with the electricity infrastructure is its production
and consumption must be in perfect sync. If 100 is produced, 80 is
needed, 20 goes to waste (or never produced to begin with). This is
cumbersome tech, impractical. Energy production and consumption needs
to be decoupled, excess can be stored using green methods via clean
fuels.

CleanTechnica: "Green Hydrogen To Rescue 'Stranded' Offshore Wind
Resources.. [It is possible] excess electricity from offshore wind
turbines is shunted to electrolyzer systems primarily at night, when
wind speeds pick up but electricity demand slows down.. The hydrogen
produced from offshore electrolyzers would be transported to shore by
pipeline or by ship...

'Wind Europe have identified that a considerable portion of the
low-cost offshore wind resource in Europe is located within the North
Sea, much of which is at a significant distance from shore and from
existing electrical infrastructure.. This configuration presents a
significant opportunity for the production and storage of hydrogen at
the source of electricity production offshore, leveraging existing
infrastructure in the region' [Net Zero org explains]"

Nicolai Petro is right.. far-left, far-right traditionally had extreme

is extremist - they expanded NATO, hawkishly provoked Ukraine's big

III. Now the so called far-left and right are promoting a sane
solution (oddly called "extremist" bcz of it). Lest we forget the
neo-lib, globalist, ultra-free market ideology of today's center was
*always* an extremist approach historically. Thanks to decades of
propaganda people forgot how off-kilter these muckers truly are, in
worldview, solutions, and default positions.

The American Conservative: "A Vision for a New NATO.. Expansion was a
misstep, but the situation is not unsalvageable‚Äîhistory offers clues
to a better way...

On an unusually cloudy July day in London in 1990, the heads of state
and government at the annual NATO summit declared with sunny optimism
that a new era beckoned in central and eastern Europe. The declaration
itself was banal bureaucratese: invitations to initiate diplomatic
contacts, plans to prepare a force structure that would move away from
'forward defense' towards 'flexible response.'.. 

Secretary of State James Baker had personally assured Gorbachev in
February that NATO would move 'not one inch' eastward. This pledge was
repeated in some form or other by NATO Secretary-General Manfred
W√∂rner, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Margaret Thatcher,
Francois Mitterrand, and President George H. W. Bush. British Prime
Minister John Major, when asked by Soviet Marshal Dmitri Yazov about
East European leaders‚Äô interest in NATO membership, reassured him that
'nothing of the sort will happen.'..

[A] careful study of Russian reactions to various phases of NATO
enlargement gives the impression of a rational power originally
determined to be a friend if not an ally of the West... The surprise
in Moscow was therefore palpable when the NATO enlargement study was
launched in 1995, leading Boris Yeltsin to declare that the Cold War
was slowly being replaced with a 'Cold Peace.' The pro-Western
democrats in Russia naturally felt betrayed, rightly recognizing NATO
expansion as a threat to their domestic influence"

Quora: "[W]hen the [French] PM is from an opposite group (this
situation is called cohabitation) his/her powers become clearer. This
happens when the majority in the national assembly changes during
presidential office, the President has to choose a PM from the new
majority (not legally but strategically, and this has happened 3 times
since the beginning of the 5th Republic in 1958). There the PM has
democratic legitimacy because the change in majority means that the
citizens are unsatisfied with the President's party's policy, so it
becomes politically dangerous for the President to oppose the PM's
actions, especially the choice of the ministers, and refusing to sign
the decrees implementing new laws (it happens though).  As you can
guess cohabitation periods are complicated, with many tensions and
more or less difficulties to govern considering the actors' ability to
find compromises and to cooperate with each other"
