<h1>Week 52</h1>
<p>Ed Zitron: "In the last year, I’ve spent about 200,000 words on a kind
of personal journey where I’ve tried again and again to work out
why everything digital feels so broken, and why it seems to keep
getting worse, despite what tech’s 'brightest' minds might
promise. More regularly than not, I’ve found that the answer is fairly
simple: the tech industry’s incentives no longer align with the user. </p>
<p>The people running the majority of internet services have used a
combination of monopolies and a cartel-like commitment to
growth-at-all-costs thinking to make war with the user, turning the
customer into something between a lab rat and an unpaid intern, with
the goal to juice as much value from the interaction as possible. To
be clear, tech has always had an avaricious streak, and it would be
naive to suggest otherwise, but this moment feels different. I’m
stunned by the extremes tech companies are going to extract value from
customers, but also by the insidious way they’ve gradually degraded
their products...</p>
<p>As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from
every user, everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through
plugins, advertising, microtransactions and other things that
constantly gnaw at the user experience. We load websites expecting
them to be broken, especially on mobile, because every single website
has to have 15+ different ad trackers, video ads that cover large
chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email or for us to let
them send us notifications...</p>
<p>Your work software veers between 'shit' and 'just okay,' and never
really seems to get better, nor does any part seem to smoothly connect
to another. Your organization juggles anywhere from five to fifteen
different pieces of software — Slack or Microsoft Teams and/or Zoom
for communication, Asana or Monday or Basecamp for project management,
or Jira, or Trello, or any number of other different ways that your
organization or team wants to plan things. When you connect with
another organization, you find they’re using a different product, or
perhaps they’re using the same one — say, Slack — and that one
requires you to join their organization, which may or may not work"</p>

<p>If Iran / Russia were unhappy with Assad but Israel was, both
countries could prefer a new regime given they received certain
guarantees. In that case the toppling of Assad becomes an RU/TR/IR
operation. How Syria shapes up after Assad will give clues which side
pulled off this feat.</p>
<hr />
<p>The New Arab: "A series of reportedly leaked documents found following
Bashar al-Assad's regime collapse have revealed a covert channel of
communication between Syria and Israel. Although the papers have not
been independently verified, they bear the official Syrian Arab
Republic letterheads and intelligence branch stamps.</p>
<p>Photographs of the alleged documents were shared widely online by
several journalists in Syria and pan-Arab Arabic language media
outlets. The contents of the reported documents challenge the
long-standing narrative that the Assad government was a steadfast
opponent of Israel, instead portraying its alleged complicity in
Israeli military operations against Iranian targets"</p>

<p>This week is another reminder that:</p>
<p>We don't have an energy shortage</p>
<p>We don't have an insulin shortage</p>
<p>We don't have a housing shortage</p>
<p>We don't have a teacher shortage</p>
<p>We don't have a labor shortage</p>
<p>We don't have a food shortage</p>
<p>We have a billionaire excess who buy politicians to deny us access to
basic human rights"</p>

<p>Oliver Stone, <em>The Untold History of US</em>: "Roosevelt kept up his harsh
attack on business throughout the 1936 campaign. He trumpeted the list
of progressive achievements. The Works Progress Administration (WPA)
and other government programs put millions of unemployed back to work
in government jobs. The economic and banking systems had been
reformed. The government, for the first time, sided, however
tentatively, with labor against the employers and nurtured the growth
of unions. Social Security guaranteed a modicum of comfort in old age
that few workers had previously enjoyed. The tax burden was shifted
increasingly to the wealthy.</p>
<p>On the eve of the election, Roosevelt took his defiantly antibusiness
message to supporters at Madison Square Garden, declaring,</p>
<p>'We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace—business and
financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking class antagonism,
sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the
Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own
affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as
dangerous as Government by organized mob … They are unanimous in their
hate for me—and I welcome their hatred.'</p>
<p>When election day came around, the revitalized Democrats gave the
Republicans the political thrashing of their lives at every level.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Windsors running UK.. Fine. It would be much better
than.. whatever the f--k this is right now, the system they have,
where bidness is calling the shots and everyone else gets the shaft.</p>
<hr />
<p>The state of UK / US is so bad if their respective militaries took
over and ran the country they would be better off. Some countries need
to experience a firm hand for a while so their plutocratic culture is
cleansed.</p>
<hr />
<p>And the London mayor was knighted all of a sudden.. Is he being primed
to take the job after Starm, so now the challenger will have a
balancing title, the two can knight off?</p>
<hr />
<p>Byline Times: "The Prime Minister's acceptance of right-wing economic
orthodoxy is pushing his party and the country towards disaster,
argues his former adviser Simon Fletcher..</p>
<p>For Ipsos, latest research has just 27% of the public satisfied with
Starmer's performance, with 61% dissatisfied. Public satisfaction with
the Government is also low, with a net satisfaction rating of -49...</p>
<p>Perhaps inevitably, but certainly very early on in the parliament,
there is now speculation that Labour's poor performance may mean that
Starmer will not survive as Labour leader and Prime Minister into the
next election"</p>
<hr />
<p>The Guardian: "[2013] In a cruel twist of fate, I fear that the
movement for women's liberation has become entangled in a dangerous
liaison with neoliberal efforts to build a free-market society. That
would explain how it came to pass that feminist ideas that once formed
part of a radical worldview are increasingly expressed in
individualist terms. Where feminists once criticised a society that
promoted careerism, they now advise women to "lean in". A movement
that once prioritised social solidarity now celebrates female
entrepreneurs. A perspective that once valorised "care" and
interdependence now encourages individual advancement and meritocracy.</p>
<p>What lies behind this shift is a sea-change in the character of
capitalism. The state-managed capitalism of the postwar era has given
way to a new form of capitalism - 'disorganised', globalising,
neoliberal. Second-wave feminism emerged as a critique of the first
but has become the handmaiden of the second"</p>

<p>I used to think that the most unrealistic thing in Bond films was the
crazy super-billionaires striving for world domination.</p>
<p>Today I know that the most unrealistic thing in Bond films is probably
efficient state institutions and courageous, well-resourced
individuals who prevent crazy super-billionaires from seeking world
domination"</p>

<p>"@GeofCox@climatejustice.social</p>
<p>My perspective from France includes reservations about both the UK's
'metro mayors' model and unitary authorities. Although such things
exist in France (eg. Paris. which is both a commune and a department),
the backbone of French democracy is the small commune with its elected
mayor.  The commune I live in has only just over a thousand residents.</p>
<p>Mayors are powerful, and local people have real access to them.  When
we moved here, we went to see the mayor (which is the norm here) and
he personally guided us round the village school (we moved with an
8-year-old).  When we had a problem with the village road outside our
house, we went to see the mayor and a few days later the local team
came a put in new drainage - and that afternoon the mayor himself came
round and asked if that had all gone ok.</p>
<p>You see how different - how much more local and friendly and
responsive - this is, compared with the UK ?  Shouldn't you be
devolving power down to much smaller areas/populations, rather than up
to metro mayors and unitary authorities?"</p>
<hr />
<p>There was major animosity between RFK and LBJ, Robert K never agreed
Johnson's pick as VP, while in office, heading DOJ, he even started an
investigation on Johnson. Needless to say as President, Johnson was
saved from any such probes into his past (which was murky to say the
least).</p>
<hr />
<p>LBJ escalated the war in Vietnam and profited handsomely from it, he
had investments in multiple weapon manufacturing firms. He left office
as a billionaire in today's dollars.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tim Fleming: "Mac Wallace, a convicted killer and a close associate of
LBJ, had his fingerprints lifted from one of the boxes near the
sniper’s nest in the Texas School Book Depository building. Wallace
has long been suspected of being LBJ’s own personal hit man. Evidence
of this comes from Billy Sol Estes, LBJ’s long-time bagman and bribe
collector. Estes’ attorney wrote the following letter to the Justice
Department in 1984:</p>
<p>'.. Dear Mr. Trott:</p>
<p>My client, Mr. Estes, has authorized me to make this reply to your
letter of May 29, 1984. Mr. Estes was a member of a four-member group,
headed by Lyndon Johnson, which committed criminal acts in Texas in
the 1960's. The other two, besides Mr. Estes and LBJ, were Cliff
Carter and Mac Wallace. Mr. Estes is willing to disclose his knowledge
concerning the following criminal offenses:</p>
<p>Murders</p>
<ol>
<li>The killing of Henry Marshall</li>
<li>The killing of George Krutilek</li>
<li>The killing of Ike Rogers and his secretary</li>
<li>The killing of Harold Orr</li>
<li>The killing of Coleman Wade</li>
<li>The killing of Josefa Johnson</li>
<li>The killing of John Kinser</li>
<li>The killing of President J. F. Kennedy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Mr. Estes is willing to testify that LBJ ordered these killings, and
that he transmitted his orders through Cliff Carter to Mac Wallace,
who executed the murders'"</p>
