Racer: "After four seasons of Extreme E, Extreme H will arrive next
year... 'There’s never been more need to look into new ways of using
alternative energies than now,' [CEO Agag says]. '.. we’re going to
focus on cars and the use of hydrogen for cars; it’s a championship
that is going to be focused on hydrogen in general.'..

Agag has spoken before about Extreme H’s ambition to attract energy
companies and tech companies.. manufacturers are once again taking
note, especially as consumer doubts around conventional EVs remain.

'We had a very, very productive meeting a few weeks ago where a very
large number of car manufacturers showed up with great interest for
the championship,' he says. 'I was surprised myself'"

Tulip Mania was out of Holland wasn't it? The first widely recognized

It looks like the rabid trader, plutocracy-based culture also survived
in Netherlands. It's interesting, when we look at all the countries
who are most disturbed by Russia (which descends from a security /
militocratic culture) are the Anglo, and Netherlands..  In relation to
its size and influence, the amt of aid NL supplies to Ukraine is
massive. The issue might be cultural.

Turchin: "Gunpowder weapons underwent a rapid evolution during the
fifteenth century.. Small principalities and city-states could no
longer hide behind their walls, which were easily breached by
cannons. Intense military competition between European states weeded
out those that couldn’t raise large armies; produce muskets and
artillery in quantity; and build expensive modern fortifications that
could withstand cannon fire...

The Military Revolution also triggered a revolution in governance and
finance because successful states had to learn how to efficiently
extract and use wealth from their populations.. As a result, medieval
militocracies gradually evolved into ruling classes that combined
military and administrative functions...

[T]hanks to its protected position in the British Isles.. England
dispense[d] with the standing army.. The squirearchy, which started as
a military class, gradually lost its military character and became
simply a class of landowners.. A large merchant class evolved.. the
United Kingdom came to be ruled by an elite that combined economic and
administrative functions... Although most plutocracies rapidly went
extinct, some lingered longer than others... The Netherlands survived
into the twenty-first century, in part thanks to its waterways and
canals"

his 140,000 vehicle after the battery died, and that the electric
automaker told him a replacement would cost 26,000.. Mario Zelaya

"@XLCChelt@mastodonapp.uk

Liberals will say 'hey, why don't you lefties stop the "far-right"?'

Because in what is called 'politics', 'left' parties are only allowed
to 'win' if they'll continue all the current economic systems -
capitalism and the wealthy with power and status at the top.

Otherwise the whole establishment's might will get unleashed to stop
them, well before they can make the required real economic change, as
that is what would end their whole scam taking [from] the rest of us"

Electrolytes: regulate body's electrical functions. A lot of hidden
ailments are tied to a lack of it: calcium, chloride, magnesium,
potassium, sodium. There are water solubile tablets, easy to
take. Note these elements are not all vitamins, but specific minerals
for neural sys.

*Dark Matter*, good show. Its science is unsurprisingly bullshit

Joan Westennerg: "6 months ago, I left the bullshit industrial
complex.. I used to be good at spinning stories. Give me a half-baked
startup idea, a semi-charismatic founder and a fistful of VC dollars,
and I could write a story compelling enough it barely mattered whether
there was an ounce of truth in it... [But] I would lie awake at 3 AM,
staring at the ceiling. My life was slipping away, and I had nothing
to show for it but a series of cynical half truths paid for by shit
shovelling wannabe billionaires hell bent on leaving the world worse
off than they found it. I knew I was a part of something poisonous. It
had been years since I'd displayed a shred of journalistic
integrity...

One morning, I sat down at my desk to craft yet another press release
touting yet another 'game-changing' startup that had raised - yet
another - $25 million. And I realized I couldn't remember the last
time I'd written something I believed in. The words that used to flow
felt like trying to squeeze ancient toothpaste from an empty
tube. That was the day I cracked... Somewhere along the way, I'd
allowed my writing—the thing that used to give me purpose—to be
co-opted by the bullshit industrial complex...

I have zero faith in the idea that unfettered vulture capitalism and a
blind pursuit of 'disruption' will lead us to a better world. I've
seen how perverse incentives and boiler room pressure to deliver
exponential growth can warp even the most idealistic founders'
vision. I've watched brilliant minds get sucked into the vortex of
funding rounds and vanity metrics, losing sight of why they started
their companies in the first place"

"@GeofCox@climatejustice.social

[A]fter the war the allies pretty much imposed the 'Mitbestimmung'
system (worker participation in management) on German industry -
because it was clear that inequality, exploitation and social division
had led to fascism, war, holocaust - but bizarrely failed to adopt it
themselves, even when it became clear it was working better than their
own systems"

Monbiot, The Guardian: "Things are not going to get better as long as
oligarchs rule the roost in our democracies.. [Some post-WWII
beneficial] politics were the result of something known to economic
historians as the 'great compression': a drastic reduction in
inequality caused by two world wars. In many powerful countries, a
combination of the physical destruction of assets, the loss of
colonial and overseas possessions, inflation, very high taxes, wage
and price controls, requisitioning and nationalisation required by the
wartime economy, as well as the effects of rising democracy and labour
organisation, greatly reduced the income and assets of the rich. It
also greatly improved, once the wars had ended, the position of the
poor...

[Scheidel] shows how warfare economies have been turned into welfare
economies... For example, following the defeat of Japan, the US
occupation government, led by General Douglas MacArthur, sought what
it called 'the democratization of Japanese economic institutions' to
ensure 'a wide distribution of income and ownership of the means of
production and trade'. To this end, it imposed high property taxes,
with a top marginal rate of 90%; broke up business conglomerates;
demanded a labour union law enabling the right to organise and strike,
and higher wages for workers; organised comprehensive land reform,
which dissolved large holdings and distributed them to peasants; and
introduced fiscal reform that led eventually to taxes on the highest
incomes of 75% and an inheritance tax on the largest estates of
70%. These programmes resulted in the near-total destruction of income
from capital and the creation in Japan of a political and economic
democracy, almost from scratch"

Business Insider: "Denver gave people experiencing homelessness $1,000
a month. A year later, nearly half of participants had housing"

---

Homelessness is a direct result of inequality, overpriced assets due to
asset hoarding by corporations and the rich.

However from a regular city dweller POV, the encampments are on public
space that are open to all, but permanent structures on it, however
shoddy, deny others that public space. It's like encampments create
little privatized spaces plundered from the citizenry, for free. The
SCOTUS decision is fine from that angle, long-term fixes on
inequality, and near term help for homeless with public housing would
be good too.

WRMEA: "[2022/11] AIPAC Election Role Raises Question of Foreign Agent
Registration.. For the first time, the American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC) formed two [PACs] which have set records in their
contributions to candidates in primary election campaigns this year...

AIPAC also launched a super PAC [UDP]..  which initially did not
include any mention of Israel in its 'About Us' statement. As a super
PAC, UDP can accept unlimited donations, but it must disclose its
donors. It cannot fund candidates directly, but it can spend unlimited
amounts advocating for or against candidates. UDP was the biggest
spending political action committee during the primaries and dispensed
more than $24.2 million in support of its favored candidates. Out of
eight candidates backed by UDP, six won their primaries..

Going back to the 1950s, the Eisenhower administration repeatedly
insisted that the American Zionist Council (AZC) register as 'agents
of a foreign government'..

[In his book Grant F. Smith] writes: 'Not until the early 1960s would
the Senate begin to investigate whether U.S. aid sent overseas and
other funds were being secretly laundered back into the U.S. to obtain
political influence and additional foreign aid. In 1963, a close
analysis of [AZC official] I. L. Kenen’s financing revealed that this
was indeed happening'..  The Senate hearings documented the fact that
in the early 1960s, Israel funneled $5 million (more than 35 million
in today’s dollars) into U.S. propaganda and lobbying operations"

Apple's new slogan should be 'act different.'

Today, we informed Apple of our preliminary view that its App Store
rules are in breach of the Digital Markets Act, as they prevent app
developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for
offers and content.

We also opened a new non-compliance procedure over concerns that its
new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app
stores fall short of ensuring effective #DMA compliance"

H2 View: "Quantum Dots Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production.. A
paper recently published in the journal Applied Sciences reviewed the
application of quantum dots for photocatalytic [H2]
production.. Carbon quantum dots possess unique electrical and optical
properties.. [they] serve as electron reservoirs to prevent charge
carrier recombination and as photosensitizers to enhance solar light
absorption, leading to improved photocatalytic performance"

TLDR; EPA discovered that Apple was:

- illegally treating hazardous waste

- illegally transporting hazardous waste to disposal facilities 

- illegally dumping hazardous waste into the ambient air outside the
  facility (into the apartment windows)

- leaving stockpiles of extremely dangerous chemicals unattended on weekends"

In 2020, I nearly died from mysterious industrial chemical exposure at
my apartment. Later, in 2023, I discovered my employer was dumping
toxic waste into the apartment windows from their Skunkworks
semiconductor fab next-door. I tipped off the US EPA, who sent their
env cops to raid Apple's plant in Aug of 2023. The US EPA finally
released the report of their enforcement inspections & sent me a copy
on Friday"

Hi journalists, it's not an 'AI boom'.

It's an 'AI bubble'.

It doesn't even matter if AI works or not (it doesn't). All the
hallmarks of an economic bubble are there:

1. Hugely inflated asset prices far beyond their intrinsic value
(NVIDIA is the world's highest capitalized company right now)

2. Way too much money all chasing just AI companies

3. Highly speculative behavior trying to strike it rich by waiting to
sell to new investors, despite knowledge that value is highly inflated"
