<p>Jeffrey Sachs: "On the basis of Poland’s economic success, I was
contacted in 1990 by Grigory Yavlinsky, economic adviser to President
Mikhail Gorbachev, to offer similar advice to the Soviet Union, and in
particular to help mobilize financial support for the economic
stabilization and transformation of the Soviet Union. One outcome of
that work was a 1991 project undertaken at the Harvard Kennedy School
with Professors Graham Allison, Stanley Fischer, and Robert
Blackwill. We jointly proposed a 'Grand Bargain' to the U.S., G7, and
Soviet Union, in which we advocated large-scale financial support by
the U.S. and G7 countries for Gorbachev’s ongoing economic and
political reforms...</p>
<p>I advocated urgent financial assistance for Poland, the Soviet Union,
Russia, and Ukraine. My advice was heeded by the U.S. government in
the case of Poland, but firmly rejected by the U.S. government in the
case of Gorbachev’s Soviet Union and Yeltsin’s Russia. At the time I
couldn’t understand why. After all, my advice worked in Poland. Only
many years later did I appreciate better that while I was discussing
the 'right' kind of economics, my interlocutors in the U.S. government
were the early neoconservatives. They were not after Russia’s economic
recovery..</p>
<p>Looking back on the events around 1991 to 1993, and to the events that
followed, it is clear that the U.S. was determined to say no to
Russia’s aspirations for peaceful and mutually respectful integration
of Russia and the West. The end of the Soviet period and the beginning
of the Yeltsin presidency occasioned the rise of the neoconservatives
to power in the United States. The neocons did not and do not want a
mutually respectful relationship with Russia"</p>

<p>Sargent: "The essential measures that ended hyperinflation in each of
Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Poland were, first, the creation of an
independent central bank that was legally committed to refuse the
government's demand for additional unsecured credit and, second, a
simultaneous alteration in the fiscal policy regime. These measures
were interrelated and coordinated. They had the effect of binding the
government to place its debt with private parties and foreign
governments which would value that debt according to whether it was
backed by sufficiently large prospective taxes relative to public
expenditures. In each case that we have studied, once it became widely
understood that the government would not rely on the central bank for
its finances, the inflation termi- nated and the exchanges
stabilized. We have further seen that it was not simply the increasing
quantity of central bank notes that caused the hyperinflation, since
in each case the note circulation continued to grow rapidly after the
exchange rate and price level had been stabilized.  Rather, it was the
growth of fiat currency which was unbacked, or backed only by
government bills, which there never was a prospect to retire through
taxation"</p>

<p>The American Conservative: "It is remarkable how many well-informed
conservative foreign policy strategists have never even heard of the
State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration
(PRM).  Even those who closely follow immigration and border issues
rarely understand the role PRM plays in accommodating and promoting
the worldwide movement of illegal migrants...</p>
<p>[E]ven more consequential than PRM’s refugee admissions is the
bureau’s diplomatic support and international grant-giving to the
worldwide 'irregular' migration industry. PRM doles out around $4
billion annually, mainly to establishment international organizations
such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organization for Migration (IOM),
and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>
<p>These multilateral organizations, funded by Washington, do more than
manage genuine refugees and displaced persons. They are the juggernaut
of today’s open-border ideology, taking resources from donor
governments to promote concepts that chip away and undermine national
borders, while advancing a global 'right to migrate'"</p>

<p>Per SP 500 Schiller P/E, the price earnings ratio is calculated by
dividing a company's stock by its earnings per share. P/E ratio shows
what the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its current
earnings, or the price for one unit of earning. PE for SP 500 does
that for the whole index, divides the market price for all 500 stocks
(the index) by the reported earnings of those companies (trailing 12
months). High P/E ratios generally signify a company (or companies) is
overvalued whereas low ones indicate it may be a good value buy.</p>

<p>Original religions are left-wing, they are also pre-agro, pro-forager
which implies most of our left-wing impulses can also be traced back
to the forager. And this is in fact true. Pre-agro human was not
hierarchical, practiced ownership but did not accumulate stuff (could
not, given the nature of his/her methods of production), they were not
patriarchal, the relationship between the sexes were not strict,
combative and/or compartmentalized. Everyone could get food via
hunting, everyone had shelter, they worked 20 hours a week.</p>
<hr />
<p>It makes sense religion appealed, invoked the wilderness loving part
in us, because all religions are political movements that rebel
against systems which themselves are founded on organized
agriculture. Wilderness = forager, post forager = farming (farming
displaced, replaced foragers as history tells us). Organized agro
means static farmer, empires (who tax them), war, disease, death, and
all the ills that come with it.</p>
<p>Some religions even tried to create rules that were in line with the
forager; fasting simulates the life of a hunter-gatherer - sometimes
there is no food, sometimes there is lots of food. "Always having
food" is a foreign concept for us, biologically, which was only made
possible after farming came into the scene. But in essence, due to our
biology, we are not used to this modern situation. Some religions
bring that back, for short periods.</p>

<p>RFK Jr: "The central revelation of every one of th[e major] religions
always occurred in the wilderness.. Moses had to go into that
wilderness to listen, to hear God's voice and see the burning bush. He
had to go to the wilderness at Mount Sinai to get the
commandments. Muhammad was a city boy from Mecca, had to go to the
wilderness and Mount Harar on a camping trip, with his kids and
wrestle the angel Gabriel in the middle of the night, and have the
first suras of the Koran [delivered to] him. Buddha had to go into the
wilderness, wander for years, and then sit under the bodhi tree to get
his first revelation of nirvana. And Christ had to spend 40 days in
the wilderness to discover its divinity for the first time. And his
mentor was John the Baptist, who lived in a cave in the Jordan Valley,
and ate honey of wild bees and locusts. All of Christ's parables come
from nature. I'm the vine. You are the branch mustard seed, the little
swallows, the scattering seeds on the ground, because that is where we
center the divine. God talks to us through the fishes, the birds, the
leaves. They're all words from our creator"</p>

<p>The article mentions McCain who achieved some success on campaign
finance only to see this work overturned by SCOTUS due to a new
pro-rich tilt of the institution thanks to the <em>masterplan</em>. The
sabotaging of Harriet Miers nomination was one of those acts. I
remember the media storm around Miers, one corp pundit even called her
"the cleaning lady" (she was W's personal lawyer). Corporate powers
got their wish, her nomination was withdrawn, more corp friendly judge
(Samuel Alito) was appointed who played a crucial role later in
the <em>Citizens United</em> ruling.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sirota, <em>Rolling Stone</em>: "Th[e] untold story [of corruption] began a
half century ago amid a golden age of democratic reforms. As America’s
government was responding to public discontent by creating Medicare,
Medicaid, environmental regulation, and a war on poverty, a genteel
tobacco industry lawyer authored a 1971 manifesto sounding an
alarm. In his now-famous memo, the soon-to-be Supreme Court justice
Lewis Powell cast corporations and oligarchs as persecuted victims,
and urged them to use their outsized resources to assume 'a broader
and more vigorous role in the political arena' to halt a government
becoming too responsive to popular demands...</p>
<p>Some have cast Powell’s blueprint as little more than a 1970s version
of a meaningless Reddit rant rather than the foundational text that
some liberals believe it to be. But if anything, the significance of
Powell’s screed has been understated... [I]n response to the memo,
leaders of the country’s most powerful corporations organized task
forces to implement its directives. One of their goals was
deregulating the campaign finance system. Why? Because they understood
that in a properly functioning one-person-one-vote democracy, they
would never be able to gain control of the political system and enact
their self-enriching, wealth-concentrating agenda. They knew that to
get their way, they must be allowed to buy elections, legislation,
court rulings, and public policy.</p>
<p>And so in short order, corporations and moguls inspired by Powell
began funding think tanks, political advocacy organizations, and
conservative law firms — and victories followed. First, with the
support of conservative philanthropist John Olin’s political machine,
Congress quietly added loopholes to the post-Watergate anti-corruption
laws allowing for the explosion of corporate political action
committees that could buy legislators... These early wins unleashed a
tidal wave of corporate money flooding into politics, which birthed an
era of neoliberal tax, deregulatory, and anti-union policies, just as
the master planners wanted. It also delivered an attendant epoch of
corruption scandals, from Abscam, to the Keating Five, to Enron, to
Jack Abramoff and the K Street Project"..</p>

<p>It looks correct.</p>
<p>Note recent Schiller trend is up (overvaluation) so the market must
come down, 10 year returns are about to go to the gutter if this
thesis is correct.</p>
<hr />
<p>Looking at SP 500 10-year returns since 1920s. One signal people use
is overlaying Schiller's P/E ratio on top, lows and highs arrive 10
years after the market is most expensive and cheapest, respectively.
If the shifts are done right, the two graphs should show
perfect reverse correlation.</p>

<p>Clearly thought leaders were able to change the discourse in a new
direction. Time to build on this, expand and implement.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Americans overwhelmingly oppose corporate monopolies and believe big
businesses have amassed too much power and influence, according to a
major new poll of seven geographically diverse states commissioned by
More Perfect Union Foundation"</p>
<p><a href="https://substack.perfectunion.us/p/new-poll-government-must-take-on">[-]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>"@rms@mastodon.xyz</p>
<p>60% of Americans think big business is too powerful.  But the
politicians who protect business's power will continue call
themselves, misleadingly, 'centrist'"</p>
<hr />
<p>Hanson's model is a quintessential American one.. talks of expansion,
dreamy shit that is unfounded that lends itself easily to scifi,
flashy, marketable narrative delivered by a Feynman-like energetic
speaker conjuring up a mad scientist image whose words are
interspersed with jokes. We should've learned not to expect much from
this type... US, and Americans have not been good stewards of
sciences.</p>
<hr />
<p>Colonizing (grabby) aliens model.. first time Im hearing it oddly
enough, it made huge waves a year ago.. Interesting, the math is fine
but if a few of its assumptions are incorrect the model will come
apart... <a href="../../2024/01/fermi-paradox.html">Desslers idea</a>, or the great
filter theory is more likely.</p>
<hr />
<p>BTW AP is an open standard World Wide Web Consortium played a role in
its design, which puts it at the same level as HTML, WebAssembly, CSS,
truly foundational technologies.</p>
<hr />
<p>Crazy coincidence... Now go implement ActivityPub bitch</p>
<p>Wiki: "Lantian 'Jay' Graber.. is an American software engineer and the
CEO of Bluesky.. Graber was born in 1991 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Her
mother named her Lantian, meaning 'blue sky' in Mandarin Chinese"</p>
<hr />
<p>Governments need to mandate interoperability between messaging
platforms, Threads users should be able to see Bluesky users and vica
versa.. They can all adapt a common protocol (Threads did this
already), the one Mastadon uses, ActivityPub is ready and
available. Gov could encourage them towards this adoption. It will
benefit consumers, as the move will increase competition. Platforms
will compete on the speed, ease-of-use of their software as they won't
be able to keep users simply by being the one platform you <em>have</em> to
be on in order to communicate.</p>

<p>BBC: "X, formerly Twitter, has been banned in Brazil after failing to
meet a deadline set by a Supreme Court judge to name a new legal

<p>Diehl: "<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0269749122017663">A study</a>
published on Science Direct in 2023, Outcomes of the Halliburton
Loophole: Chemicals regulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act in US
fracking disclosures, 2014–2021, reveals that fracking companies used
over 282 million pounds of hazardous chemicals from 2014 to 2021 with
ZERO federal oversight..</p>
<p>The paper is the first to examine the 'Halliburton Loophole' which
exempts fracking from federal regulation provided by the Safe Drinking
Water Act. The exemption was passed by Congress as part of the Energy
Policy Act of 2005, and endorsed at the time by Vice President Dick
Cheney, not coincidentally the former CEO of Halliburton, the world's
second-largest oil service company also responsible for most of the
world's largest fracking operations.</p>
<p>I could easily go on about Halliburton famously profiteering from a $7
billion closed bid contract in the Iran-Iraq War, or their involvement
in the Deep Water Horizon oil spill, and a litany of other
environmental crimes... Let’s just point out that Cheney retired from
Halliburton [before VP] with a 36 million severance package. Then
Halliburton got a 7 billion contract [during Dubya-Dick
admin]. Coincidence, I’m sure"</p>
<hr />
<p>Diehl: "In 2005, when fracking ramped up on the way to making the US
the world’s largest oil producer, atmospheric CO2 stood at just under
380 ppm (parts per million). As of August 22, it’s over 423.16
ppm. There’s a daily count to be found of this inexorable killer rise
at CO2Earth. Preindustrial levels well established through ice core
samples were just 280 ppm, and scientific consensus agrees that 350
ppm is the most CO2 in the atmosphere we can tolerate without the
profound climate change catastrophes we are experiencing today,
worsening drastically"</p>

<p>When Russians were commies I understand the "ideological struggle"
angle for the RU animosity. But after Russia became a market economy
the animosity, provocations did not end. It is clear Russians were
turned into an enemy for other reasons. Did muneeee play a role? MIC
loves its muneeeee.</p>
<hr />
<p>When you are at war with a larger opponent you are at a disadvantage
defending, they have more people, more industrial capacity. When you
invade, go after their land you are still at a disadvantage - they
have more of it than you do. </p>
<hr />
<p>You can invade Russia, sure.. it's not like it hasn't been done
before.. Some of the toughest, pipe hitting mofos
tried. Hitler. Napoleon. What happened to them?</p>
