<p>Doctorow: "The IBM PC story teaches us two things: stronger antitrust
enforcement spurs innovation and opens markets for scrappy startups to
grow to big, important firms; as do weaker IP protections.</p>
<p>Microsoft learned the opposite: monopolies are wildly profitable;
expansive IP protects monopolies; you can violate antitrust laws so
long as you have enough monopoly profits rolling in to outspend the
government until a Republican bootlicker takes the White House
(Microsoft's antitrust ordeal ended [with Dubya])...</p>
<p>Microsoft's secret sauce is <em>impunity</em>. The PC companies that bundle
Windows with their hardware are held blameless for the glaring defects
in Windows. The IT managers who buy company-wide Windows licenses are
likewise insulated from the rage of the workers who have to use
Windows and other Microsoft products.</p>
<p>Microsoft doesn't have to care if you hate it because, for the most
part, it's not selling to you. It's selling to a few decision-makers
who can be wined and dined and flattered. And since we all have to use
its products, developers have to target its platform if they want to
sell us their software.</p>
<p>This rarified position has afforded Microsoft enormous freedom to roll
out harebrained 'features' that made things briefly
attractive... Microsoft recently announced a product called 'Recall'
that would record every keystroke, click and screen element, nominally
in the name of helping you figure out what you've done and either do
it again, or go back and fix it. The problem here is that anyone who

water vapor entering the storm’s updraft will fall out as rain,
everything else the same, more water in the air flowing into the storm
will lead to more intense rainfall. That’s it. Not terribly
complicated...</p>

action. IBM tapped its vast monopoly profits to fight the DOJ,
spending more on outside counsel to fight the DOJ antitrust division
than the DOJ spent on all its antitrust lawyers, every year, for 12
years.. [later] Reagan let IBM off the hook.  But the company was
still seriously scarred by its ordeal, and when the PC project kicked
off, the company kept the OS separate from the hardware (one of the
DOJ's major issues with IBM's previous behavior was its vertical
monopoly on hardware and software). IBM didn't hire Gates and Allen to

<p>Nick Bano: "Worth remembering that [UK] ‘intentional homelessness’ was
invented to prevent queue-jumping for council flats.. Things have
degraded, and the problem it was designed to solve is now
unimaginable. It’s a relic in a country with world-beating
homelessness statistics"</p>

<p>Tony Blink Blink 737 must have overruled it. This smells like the
doing of the surface state... Military-industrial-donor complex
control of high-levels of goverment on display. The depths are fine,
the top is corrupted, amoral, mercantile.</p>
<p>The Guardian: "The state department falsified a report earlier this
month to absolve Israel of responsibility for blocking humanitarian
aid flows into Gaza, overruling the advice of its own experts,
according to a former senior US official who resigned this week.</p>
<p>Stacy Gilbert left her post as senior civil military adviser in the
state department’s bureau of population, refugees and migration, on
Tuesday. She had been one of the department’s subject matter experts
who drafted the report mandated under national security memorandum 20
(NSM-20) and published on 10 May...</p>
<p>Even more controversially, the report said the state department did
not 'currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or
otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of US humanitarian
assistance' in Gaza. It was a high-stakes judgment because under a
clause in the Foreign Assistance Act, the US would be obliged to cut
arms sales and security assistance to any country found to have
blocked delivery of US aid"</p>
