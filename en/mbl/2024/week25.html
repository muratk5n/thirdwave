<p>RFK Jr: "Two years ago the average cost of a house in this country was
$215,000, today it's 400,000. There are three giant corporations Black
Rock State Street and Vanguard, they also own 89% of the S&amp;P 500,
they've now decided to buy every single family home in America. They
stay on the current trajectory, they will own 60% of the homes in this
country, single family homes by 2030. Your kids do not have a chance
to buy that home because they can't out compete Black Rock. I'm going
to change the tax code to make it unprofitable for those companies to
compete against your children for housing. I'm going to make a
mortgage available to Americans at 3% interest I'm going to finance
those mortgages by selling tax-free Bonds on the open market available
to first time home buyers who will live in that Community"</p>

<p>Doctorow: "The IBM PC story teaches us two things: stronger antitrust
enforcement spurs innovation and opens markets for scrappy startups to
grow to big, important firms; as do weaker IP protections.</p>
<p>Microsoft learned the opposite: monopolies are wildly profitable;
expansive IP protects monopolies; you can violate antitrust laws so
long as you have enough monopoly profits rolling in to outspend the
government until a Republican bootlicker takes the White House
(Microsoft's antitrust ordeal ended [with Dubya])...</p>
<p>Microsoft's secret sauce is <em>impunity</em>. The PC companies that bundle
Windows with their hardware are held blameless for the glaring defects
in Windows. The IT managers who buy company-wide Windows licenses are
likewise insulated from the rage of the workers who have to use
Windows and other Microsoft products.</p>
<p>Microsoft doesn't have to care if you hate it because, for the most
part, it's not selling to you. It's selling to a few decision-makers
who can be wined and dined and flattered. And since we all have to use
its products, developers have to target its platform if they want to
sell us their software.</p>
<p>This rarified position has afforded Microsoft enormous freedom to roll
out harebrained 'features' that made things briefly
attractive... Microsoft recently announced a product called 'Recall'
that would record every keystroke, click and screen element, nominally
in the name of helping you figure out what you've done and either do
it again, or go back and fix it. The problem here is that anyone who
gains access to your system.. now has access to everything, on a
platter"</p>

the statistical likelihood of words following other words, sentences
following other sentences, just with a lot of data and samples to pull
from. That's it. There's no intelligence, there's no path to

<p>Dessler: "Is climate change making Florida's flooding worse?.. Warmer
air can hold more water vapor — about 7% more for every degree Celsius
increase in temperature. Consequently, the air converging into a storm
system in a warmer climate carries more water vapor. Since most of the
water vapor entering the storm’s updraft will fall out as rain,
everything else the same, more water in the air flowing into the storm
will lead to more intense rainfall. That’s it. Not terribly
complicated...</p>
<p>[T]he IPCC’s synthesis report concluded.. 'The frequency and intensity
of heavy precipitation events have increased since the 1950s over most
land areas for which observational data are sufficient for trend
analysis (high confidence), and human-caused climate change is likely
the main driver.. The projected increase in frequency and intensity of
heavy precipitation (high confidence) will increase rain-generated
local flooding'"</p>

<p>Doctorow: "Bill Gates didn't become one of the richest people on earth
simply by [luck]; he also owed his success to vigorous antitrust
enforcement. The IBM PC was the company's first major initiative after
it was targeted by the DOJ for a 12-year antitrust enforcement
action. IBM tapped its vast monopoly profits to fight the DOJ,
spending more on outside counsel to fight the DOJ antitrust division
than the DOJ spent on all its antitrust lawyers, every year, for 12
years.. [later] Reagan let IBM off the hook.  But the company was
still seriously scarred by its ordeal, and when the PC project kicked
off, the company kept the OS separate from the hardware (one of the
DOJ's major issues with IBM's previous behavior was its vertical
monopoly on hardware and software). IBM didn't hire Gates and Allen to
provide it with DOS because it was incapable of writing a PC operating
system: they did it to keep the DOJ from kicking down their door
again"</p>

<p>Even more controversially, the report said the state department did
not 'currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or
otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of US humanitarian
assistance' in Gaza. It was a high-stakes judgment because under a
clause in the Foreign Assistance Act, the US would be obliged to cut
arms sales and security assistance to any country found to have
blocked delivery of US aid"</p>
