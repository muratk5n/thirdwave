Tagine de veau aux fonds d'artichauts

For 6

1.5 kg lean shoulder of veal
8 cooked artichoke bottoms
4 large onions
4 tomatoes
2 lemons
2 cloves garlic
1 bunch parsley
1 tablespoon ground cumin
1/2 tablespoon turmeric
1 bay leaf
1 tablespoon ground ginger
1 glass dry white wine
1/2 virgin olive oil
Salt, pepper

Cut the meat into 3 cm cubes. Slice the onion and chop the garlic and
parsley.

Place the meat in a dish with the garlic, parsley, onions and all the
spices (cumin, turmeric, ginger) and half a glass of virgin olive
oil. Season with salt and pepper and marinade for 20 minutes.

Remove the meat and fry in a flameproof casserole on medium heat. As
soon as the meat is sealed, add the marinade and bay leaf and 25 cl of
white wine.

Simmer gently for half an hour with the lid off. Cover and simmer for
a further half hour. Meanwhile, cut the tomatoes and arthichoke bases
in quarters.

At the end of the cooking time, remove the meat from the casserole and
set aside to keep warm. Add the tomatoes and artichoke bases to the
cooking juices, together with juice of 2 lemons. Cook on medium heat
for 5 to 8 minutes.

Place the meat on a warmed serving dish, arranging the vegetables
around it and spooning the cooking juices over.
