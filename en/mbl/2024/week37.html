<p>Paper: "The zero-point field and the emergence of the quantum..  In
this paper we present a new way of arriving at the quantum formalism,
based on the recognition of the reality of the random zero-point
radiation field (ZPF). The advantage of this approach lies in that one
sees into the quantum world from outside, which affords a perspective
wider than the one reachable from within the quantum theory
proper. Many of the usual conceptual problems that characterize
presentday quantum mechanics (QM) are thus dissolved, and new physical
elements are integrated that help to clarify its physical and
conceptual contents. At the same time, the fresh perspective proposed
invites us to cross the doorway and go beyond the strictly
quantum-mechanical realm..</p>
<p>When referring to the problems of QM we have in mind basically those
conceptual puzzles — frequently bordering philosophy of science, to
the annoyance of some physicists, although their nature is physical —
that have been under scrutiny and debate since the early days of the
theory, but remain basically as unsolved now as they were eighty years
ago. We recall as examples: the irreducible or unexplained
indeterminism characteristic of the theory; the fact that it predicts
probabilities, not outcomes; that it then requires a measurement
theory for its accomplishment, which means opening the door to
observers and their subjectivism, and giving birth to undefined
boundaries between the quantum and the classical world. Add to this
the loss of realism; two opposed laws of evolution (Schrodinger’s
equation and the collapse of the wave function); nonlocality and, for
many, superluminal influences and so on. There are also some strictly
technical questions, such as the lack of a clear physical explanation
of the mechanism that stabilizes the atom and leads to quantized
states (rather than a mere description of the phenomenon), or of the
mechanism that entangles two identical noninteracting particles. The
list is not short...</p>
<p>It is important to realize that although the ZPF could appear at first
as a sort of collection of hidden variables introduced to complete the
quantum description, this is not the case. Quite the contrary: nothing
is added to QM, but the latter emerges from a more general theory that
contains the ZPF"</p>

<p>Obammer, Kamaller.. the invasive R.. </p>
<hr />
<p>Just kidding.. I am using his formulation, obviously we reached the
same conclusion.  I also assign an advantage to Dems, Reps have a
chance and if anyone can pull it off, it is DJT. But I have to make a
call, so I will call it for Kamaller</p>
<hr />
<p>It's like he read my mind..</p>
<p>Abramovitz: "With less than three months remaining until Election Day,
and with voting beginning next month in several states, the 2024
presidential race has been transformed by President Joe Biden’s
withdrawal from the race..</p>
<p>Many things about the 2024 election have been highly unusual,
including the withdrawal of the incumbent president under pressure
from his own party’s leaders, his replacement by a woman of mixed
Black and Indian ancestry, the Republican Party’s nomination of a
former president who has been convicted on felony charges, and an
attempted assassination attempt against that Republican
candidate. Despite these remarkable developments, however, the
<em>Time for Change</em> forecasting model should allow us to predict both the
popular and the electoral vote with a high degree of accuracy because
this election, like all presidential elections, is likely to be
decided by a few fundamental forces.</p>
<p>The assumption underlying the <em>Time for Change</em> model, which has an
excellent track record in predicting the outcomes of presidential
elections since 1992, is that the results of these contests are
largely determined by three factors: the popularity of the incumbent
president, the state of the economy, and the number of terms that the
president’s party has controlled the White House.</p>
<p>Plugging in President Biden’s net approval rating of -18% in late June
and the estimated second quarter growth rate of 2.8% in real GDP along
with the fact that Kamala Harris will be defending the White House
after a single Democratic term in office, the <em>Time for Change</em> model
predicts narrow Democratic victories"</p>

<p>Forbes: "Former President Donald Trump proposed the creation of a
sovereign wealth fund for the U.S. on Thursday, suggesting the
government-owned investment fund used by countries such as Norway,
China and South Korea would be created and partially funded by tariffs
if he wins the presidential election."</p>

<p>Steve Bannon: "America is not an idea. America is a country, with
borders and citizens"</p>
<hr />
<p>Gun violence too has to do with US' "business-first" mentality, not
attacks on "freedom". Rampant capitalism is killing those people, gun
manufacturers hide behind sacred words such as liberty, they don't
give a damn what happens to anyone as long as they make money. I don't
think the founders had the kind of hardware in mind that could take
out an entire British regiment within seconds when they wrote what
they wrote back in the day. Some perspective is needed here, but
muckers already know that. The only founder they care about is Benjamin.</p>
<hr />
<p>The French left has some bizarre ideas on Ukraine.. They are pro-war
pro-corporation funded US politics fanning the flames in the middle of
Europe causing chaos. Why would you be for that?</p>
<hr />
<p>So despite forming a block to freeze out the National Rally, the left
got nothing, NR is getting a policy concession on immigration via
Barnier. Appropriate electorally? Bcz the mechanism used to boot out
NR were un-democratic, they would have won more votes in a regular
election so deserved more concessions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Politico: "Macron attempted to break an almost two-month political
deadlock on Thursday by appointing Michel Barnier as prime
minister.. Barnier, a conservative heavyweight in the right-wing
Republicans party, is a well-known figure in Brussels, having served
as the European Union’s former chief Brexit negotiator and twice as a
European commissioner... In a conversation [in July], Barnier said
France’s most pressing issues were immigration, the state of its
public finances and rebuilding its industrial and agricultural
capacities"</p>
