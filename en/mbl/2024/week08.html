<p>Here is how a realistic movie would be like. An AK shoots 600/min, in
120 minutes 72K bullets. So the movie could be about just one guy, he
shoots an AK non-stop, from beginning until the end, constantly
reloading, and by the end of the movie, maybe he'd have taken out
one enemy soldier.</p>
<hr />
<p>Belfast Telegraph: "[2011] US forces have fired so many bullets in
Iraq and Afghanistan - an estimated 250,000 for every insurgent killed -
that American ammunition-makers cannot keep up with demand"</p>
<hr />
<p>The lone gunman among unarmed civilians, or the stock bullshit
Holywood war movie is based on a myth. The hero sprays bullets around,
shoots 100 and kills 100. Reality is going after people who are just
as intent on killing you, and that is hard. Read: "During World War II
it was estimated that 45,000 rounds of small arms ammunition was fired
to kill one enemy soldier. In Vietnam the American military
establishment consumed an estimated 50,000 rounds of ammunition for
every enemy killed".</p>
<hr />
<p>Personal weapons are the perfect market for arms co. The demand fit
with the politics of the times (anti-government, buy guns to "protect
yourself"), they sold these essentially useless products by the
millions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Arms manufacturers would like personal weapon demand to be at consumer
product level, everyone buying one or two, w/ contracts on
maintanance, some ammo purchases here and there. "Consumers" shoot
their little toy around for a little show, nothing more. When things
get serious arms co could get worried, real war is serious
business. All of a sudden you need ammunition in the millions,
production needs to ramped up for certain things not for
others.. Producing little gadgetry is different from war-time
production, and not necessarily as profitable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The surname Sununu is familiar today mainly because of a pair of
recent New Hampshire politicians, a governor and a U.S. senator, but
the most significant Sununu was their father, John H. Sununu, himself
a former New Hampshire governor and the first President Bush’s first
chief of staff. In several important ways, he was another prototypical
Republican for the new age: an asshole personally, a conservative
hard-liner, and a critical figure in turning the party toward full-bore
denial of climate change.</p>

production capacity by the end of 2024, which alone far exceeds
foreseeable global demand of around 10GW in 2025. However, latest
developments shows that Chinese electrolyzer producers didn’t halt
their expanding pace-at least five companies have announced
inauguration of new plants or beginning of construction of GW scale
production facilities just within first two months of 2024. Through
these cases, we may realize that even the most aggressive forecasts by
world leading consultancies may underestimate the capacity building of
China’s electrolyzer sector"</p>

<p>Kurt Andersen: "In the 1960s and ’70s, Daniel Moynihan had been
pigeonholed as a moderate or a conservative, but as a U.S. senator
during the 1990s, when the rest of his party went Republicanesque on
the political economy, Moynihan was a kind of heroic last left-winger
standing...</p>
<p>At the start of his presidency, Clinton tried to legislate an
expansion of the private U.S. health insurance system to make it cover
more people. 'Mr. Clinton and his allies,' a Times analysis explained
in 1994, 'were trying hard to redefine the Democratic Party away from
traditionally liberal approaches to domestic policy; they were almost
inevitably drawn to the ideas of managed competition.  Though still
largely theoretical, the concept relies on market forces, not
government, to hold down costs and expand access to health insurance.'
That is, Clinton tried and failed to pass a version of Obamacare
sixteen years before Obama succeeded..</p>
<p>[Moynihan said of Clintoncare back then] 'He hated unnecessary
government complexity' and the Clinton plan.. was complex and hard to
explain (as Obamacare would be as well). Also, Moynihan 'could see the
[so-called reform] policies' proposed by Clinton would 'not perform as
promised'"</p>

<p>Zucman, <em>The Triumph of Injustice</em>: "[2019] The only category of
income that does not benefit from any exemption, deduction, reduced
rate, or any other favor is wages. At any income level, wage earners
are thus more heavily taxed than people who derive income from
property. More broadly, people with identical incomes can have wildly
different tax bills depending on the legal (and often arbitrary)
classification of their income. The tax changes of the last twenty
years have done away with a core principle of tax justice: the notion
that people with the same income ought to pay the same amount of
tax. It’s no longer the case.  The explosive cocktail that is
undermining America’s system of taxation is simple: capital income, in
varying degrees, is becoming tax-free. This process is not uniform:
some capital taxes are disappearing faster than others. The profits of
big multinational companies bear less tax than those of domestic
businesses. Dividends bear less tax than interest income. Depending on
the nature of their wealth, rich people thus benefit in varying
degrees. The ultra-wealthy, whose income mostly derives from owning
shares in big companies, have so far been the primary winners"</p>
