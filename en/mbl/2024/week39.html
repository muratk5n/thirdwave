<h1>Week 39</h1>
<p>Tom Van Flandern: "Newton remarked.. the logical mind, competent in
philosophical matters, finds it inconceivable that one object might
act on another across a gulf of space without some intermediaries
passing between the objects to convey the action. The alternative
would require some form of magic, an effect without a cause. As such,
it would violate the causality principle, one of the fundamental
Principles of Physics. These principles have a higher status than the
so-called 'laws of physics,' such as Newton’s Universal Law of
Gravitation. Such laws may change as knowledge increases.  By
contrast, the Principles of Physics are deductions about nature so
closely related to pure logic that a definite observed violation of
one of them would bring into question the very nature of the reality
we live in"</p>
<hr />
<p>Fleming: "Fatio’s idea was that space is filled with corpuscles, and
as these corpuscles move through space, they randomly strike each
other and astronomical bodies, pushing them. If we consider two
bodies, the first body shadows the second body from the corpuscular
pressure force coming from behind the first body, and in this way
there is more force pushing the bodies together than pushing them
apart... Fatio’s theory is a true quantum gravity theory, as it is
based entirely on quantum electrodynamic principles. It also unifies
the gravitational force with the electromagnetic and mechanical
forces. The existence of the Casimir force tells us that the
Fatio-Casimir force must exist..</p>
<p>Vacuum fluctuations exert pressure uniformly in all directions such
that a body in otherwise empty space is pushed on equally from all
sides. The body is not heated either as proved by the Casimir
force. Pressure differentials due to Fatio’s shadowing effect cause
gravitational acceleration. Baseline vacuum pressure is positive and
uniform from all directions. In other words, aether gravitates without
producing a detectable gravitational force since it pushes equally
from all sides"</p>
<hr />
<p>Salvaggio: "Reasoning in OpenAI’s latest model seems to be.. a form of
prompt engineering known as 'chain of thought' engineering. Users of
the LLM would make a previous model work step by step, using
computational thinking to constrain the random outcome of a prompt
more carefully...  OpenAI isn’t sharing what these steps look like
because I kid you not, 'the model must have the freedom to express its
thoughts in unaltered form.' [meaning they don't know what the f--k
goes on in there, it is an unstructured jumble]..</p>
<p>There is a strange obsession with disproving the parrot claim among
LLM evangelists...  But it’s stochastic, all the way
down. Chain-of-thought prompting is the difference between a
fill-in-the-blank quiz and a multiple-choice quiz... It also helps
prevent 'attention' from drifting in the model. Attention is the term
used for token storage: there’s a limit on how many words a model can
pay attention to, so if you generate well beyond a prompt, the model’s
attention is more likely to drift. That’s a problem with complex
prompts — the model starts generating, and once you fill the memory
buffer, every word knocks another word out of its 'attention span.'</p>
<p>Does this mean that I think the model is useless? No. I just think the
model is a stochastic parrot. And it’s being designed backward. I’m
not sure companies need to be investing in massive, environmentally
hostile, water-intensive, energy-draining,
intellectual-property-ignoring datasets if the end result is that they
just end up blocking out access to a vast proportion of the resulting
model"</p>

<hr />
<p>Look at how they are dressed, in uniforms of sorts.. But it is their
<em>personal</em> uniform, as they are not part of a security / military
apparatus, they are a one-man-army of their own. The fascination with
violence must have its cultural basis here (it turns out Rapaille
identified sex equates to violence in US emotional brain).</p>
<hr />
<p>Militocracy-descendant cultures centralized violence, its populace are
used to the pecking order when it comes to the subject.. Anglo comic
book heroes are somewhat bizarre compared to it, the characters are
somewhat laughed at in many places outside US. Plutocracies see
themselves as decentralized peoples who can wheel and deal and of
course, apply violence, at a personal level, almost in an enterprenual
spirit when it is "necessary". Such are the Anglo heroes, they are
ass-kicking enterpreneurs, like Batman (the dumbest looking hero of
all time).</p>
<hr />
<p>Afghanistan remained a basket case, US could not, would not "fix" the
place, again bcz of US business interests. Cotton could be grown there
instead of poppy seeds, but USAID cannot help growth of such products
in other countries bcz of a law (Bumpers Amendment) that prohibits
supporting products in other countries that can compete with US
companies. Bidness interests invade a place, bidness interest keep the
place a basket case.  No surprise some in US asking themselves why
invade and stay at a place if you cannot help a place? Criticism of US
inverventionism has some of its roots in its dysfunction as well as
the money spent on it that could be spent elsewhere.</p>
<hr />
<p>I don't think Eps had anything on Trump, but the way Eps was placed in
the news circulation would have made DJT suspicious. All of a sudden
you are in the news cycle along with Andrew Windsor, f-ing Clintons..
it's disgusting. Even if Eps talked out of his ass, he could be
damaging, and Trump could want to take action on that.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you think about it, this is Trump's M.O. Remember the Soleimani
assasination. Surgical strike, taking out one guy. Boom.</p>
<hr />
<p>JE's brother is adamant about this theory, and he doesn't sound like a
kooky guy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Was deep state involved in Jeffrey Epstein's death? Why go look at the
depths? There is a clear suspect with something to gain visible for
everyone to see - it's Trump.  Anyone who can have doors opened,
cameras blinded in a federal detention must be pretty powerful figure,
federally. Who is more powerful than the freaking President?</p>

<p>Fleming: "The curved space model runs into serious difficulties when
you consider more than two objects in very different orbits. For
example, the Earth has a nearly circular orbit, but a comet passing
near the Earth is following a large elliptical path that is nearly
perpendicular to the Earth’s orbit. How can space be simultaneously
curved in two perpendicular directions? It makes no sense. If one
considers millions of photons crossing a single point in space from
different directions, it makes even less sense.  It makes no sense to
adopt a curved space model when a geometrically flat space model
works, and it does work when you have aether. Why do physicists desire
such a complicated and unnecessary model? Probably they do it because
science fiction is more fun and interesting to think about than real
science"</p>
<hr />
<p>Light being "tired" is the wrong terminology. Light enters water it
slows down, it exits water it speeds up again. If it was "tired"
wouldn't it want to remain slow, want to rest a little while?

<p>The speed of light $c$ is also the speed of light in a certain
medium. That medium is the aether = quantum field. Quantum field
exists, otherwise Casimir Effect would not work (experimentally
proven). Space is not empty. Aether (QF) provides resistance to light
in certain ways that results in $c$.  Other mediums slow down light in
different ways, making the speed less than $c$ like glass and water.</p>
<hr />
<p>We already know light slows down in different medium. It slows down
when it enters into glass. Same with water.</p>

<p>Dampier: "Among the fatal flaws in the Telecom Act of 1996 were its
various ‘competition tests,’ which were open to considerable
interpretation and latitude at the FCC. The Republican supporters of
the bill argued that the presence of an open and free marketplace
would, by itself, induce competition among various entrants. They were
generally unconcerned with the question of whether new competition
would actually arrive. Their priority was lifting the protective
levers of legacy regulation as soon as possible. Many Democrats
assumed what appeared to be carefully drafted regulatory language
would protect consumers by preventing the FCC from lifting protections
too early in the competitive process. But lobbyists consistently
outmaneuvered lawmakers, finding ways to insert loopholes and
compromise language that introduced inconsistencies that could be
dealt with and eliminated either by the FCC or the courts later...</p>
<p>The first warning the 1996 Act was going awry came a year after the
bill was signed into law. Phone companies started raising rates from
1.50 - 6 dollars a month on average. AT&amp;T was petitioning to hike
rates $7 a month. Someone would have to pay to replace the scrapped
subsidy system in a competitive market — subsidies that had been in
place at the nation’s phone companies for decades. By charging higher
rates for phone service in cities and for pricier long distance calls
before the arrival of companies like MCI and Sprint, the phone
companies used this revenue to subsidize their Universal Service
obligations, keeping rural phone bills low and often below the real
cost of providing service. To establish a truly competitive phone
business, the subsidies had to be reformed or go, and that meant
someone had to cover the difference"</p>
<hr />
<p>Dampier: "[Clinton's] Telecom Act of 1996 Sowed the Seeds of a Telecom
Oligopoly.. How exactly did America get stuck with a broadband
monopoly in many areas, a duopoly in most others? It did not happen by
accident.. By understanding the trickery and legislative shell games
practiced by lobbyists and their elected partners in Congress, you
will learn to recognize when the telecom industry and their friends
are preparing to sell you another bill of goods"</p>

<p>US gave it to the French and Brits, the French gave it to Israel,
Russia stole it from the Americans, then gave it to China,
India. China gave the tech to Pakistan to balance out
India. Reportedly Pakistan recently told Anatolians ("Turks") here you
take nuke tech from us to be used against Israelis, you bomb the
muckers so it's not on us. An extreme scenario surely.</p>
<hr />
<p>AFAIK unless the original research at Los Alamos is passed down onto a
country, that country is not able to create a nuclear weapon.. They
made a key finding at that lab that is crucial to get the thing to
function. Other countries have built nukes independently but they
never truly seem to work because they are missing that key piece. I
believe North Korea, Iran's programs are not functional, not at weapon
grade level. But of course Russia can just give the tech to them, just
like they gave it to China and India.</p>

<p>Officially I'll stick to the original prediction... I'm using polling
data to gauge a lower bound on Dem campaigning, meh, not terrible so
far. Combined, let's still say Kamaller, I'll eat crow if it goes the
other way.</p>
<hr />
<p>If we negate the incumb adv for Dems, their chance for win is,</p>
<pre><code>Interval: [42.95 50.51] Average: 46.73

<p>Most likely a loss.</p>
<hr />
<p>Should Trump be seen as an incumbent? He did not get his chance for a
second term, he is running for that now, just like an incumbent
would. Since 2020 was such a confusing time, a chaos, squint a little,
it could look like two incumbents are running against each other. That
would change the outcome of the Abramovitz formula.</p>
<hr />
<p>Theory of Everything attempts keep falling short bcz the previous
layer(s) have faults. We should not delude ourselves thinking the WWI
generation had everything figured out. Yankee sci culture is too
insecure to go there, US led sci consensus keeps trying to maintain
the foundational layer and somehow "connect stuff on top" and have
their grand theory. Everything is a f-ing mess and this modern
consensus is to blame. Just look at international relations and
project that onto science. Same dipshittery everywhere, with the same
sad result.</p>
<hr />
<p>Good point by Marmet.. you can come up with eqns that fit the data,
but are those the right equations that explain the reality that
produce that data?</p>
<hr />
<p>Einstein was wrong</p>
<hr />
<p>Paul Marmet: "Many experiments, like the Michelson-Morley and Sagnac
experiments and others, are testing the fundamental nature of
light. It is conflicting to observe that the velocity of photons is
measured as a constant, when the observer moves away from that light
source. Since all other particles are measured with additive
velocities ($V-v$) or ($V+v$) with respect to a moving frame, why can
photons not obey that same rule?  Since Newton's mechanics has shown
that all relative velocities produce a Doppler frequency shift, we
must expect that some special phenomena prevent us from detecting the
real change of relative velocity. It is quite incorrect to believe
that this phenomenon cannot be explained using physical reality and
Newton physics.  As required by the principle of mass-energy
conservation, the atoms (nucleus and electrons) forming the local
standard reference meter and the moving clock have acquired some extra
mass due to the materialization of kinetic energy. Quantum mechanics
shows that this increase of energy changes the de Broglie electron
wavelength and consequently, the Bohr radius and the clock rate. It is
surprising to find new hypotheses like space-time distortion, and even
more, the suggestion of 'new logic' to explain these observations,
while it is not taken into account that the rate of the moving clock
is naturally modified due to the increase of mass (following the
absorption of kinetic energy). The simple application of the principle
of mass-energy conservation explains naturally all these experiments..
We must recall that an empirical equation used to predict the outcome
of a physical system is <em>not an explanation</em>"</p>

<p>Puerto Rico was clearly invaded by US corporate power..</p>
<p>Kinzer, <em>Overthrow, US' Century of Regime Change</em>: "During the early
years of the twentieth century, four American corporations gobbled up
most of Puerto Rico's best land. On it they planted sugar, a crop
suited to large-scale farming. The big losers were families who grew
coffee, which is known as the 'poor man's crop' because it can be
cultivated on small plots. By 1930, sugar accounted for 60 percent of
the country's exports, while coffee, once the island's principal crop,
had fallen to just 1 percent... With little access to land, ordinary
Puerto Ricans became steadily poorer. One study found that while 17
percent of them were unemployed at the time of the American invasion,
30 percent were unemployed a quarter century later"</p>
