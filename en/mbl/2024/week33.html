<p>Remember #2018 in UK when they added stamp duty for second homes,
they also introduced an exemption if you bought seven properties at
the same time, Jeremy Hunt, the Chancellor at the time went out and
bought seven homes... If we allow them these f--kers will bankrupt us
all.</p>
<hr />
<p>The part on corps being involved in real-estate market denying new
buyers access was good..  Most of the housing crisis has to do w/ the
rich taking more assets than they can use. "Building more homes"
cannot be the primary fix. As long as inequality exists, those new

<p>"Opportunity economy" sounded somewhat Clintonesque.. Was that a cover
for "populism"?</p>
<p>Politico: "The vice president Friday briefly touted the economic
progress and accomplishments under the Biden administration.. but she
said she knows many Americans arenâ€™t yet feeling improving conditions.</p>
<p>'Costs are still too high. And on a deeper level, no matter how much
they work, it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead,' she
said. 'As president, I will be laser-focused on creating opportunities
for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability
and dignity...'</p>
<p>Harris... has also leaned further into aggressive attacks on
corporations for 'price gouging' and driving up prices at the grocery
store. And she has filtered well-worn ideas through a new,
unapologetically [lefty] lens.</p>
<p>That has made for a striking contrast from Biden, who never completely
warmed to efforts to shift the blame for inflation to big business and
often softened his own populist rhetoric with reassurances that he was
a 'capitalist.'"</p>

<p>31 C is a better number.. I've seen 22 C, it's bad.. 25 C would be

<p>Nature: "The threshold for survival in heat is lower than thought â€”
researchers are using state-of-the-art climate chambers to explore

<p>[Wet Bulb Temperature] is a measure that scientists use when studying
heat stress because it accounts for the effects of heat and
humidity.. The models churned out a WBT of 35 Â°C as the limit of human
survival. At that threshold, the bodyâ€™s core temperature would rise
uncontrollably. But the model treated the human body as an unclothed
object that doesnâ€™t sweat or move, making the result less applicable
to the real world.. [But a] 2021 study.. provided a better estimate: a
WBT survival limit of around 31 Â°C. They calculated it by tracking the
core body temperature of young, healthy people under different
combinations of temperature and humidity while they were cycling"</p>

Linux, or more precisely Ubuntu in the LTS (Long-Term Support)

<p>According to deputy headmaster Michael Schacht, the reason is freedom,

school can use digital products as it pleases. You can look 'under the

<p>Which one is more fundamental (even though both my be incomplete) -
QM, or relativity? It's probably the former, not the latter. It is
highly likely GR formula can be derived by other means.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are some fine researchers working on the modern aether theory,
trying to scale Casimir effect to cosmological. Ulf Leonhardt is
active here, he wrote <em>Forces of the Quantum Vacuum</em> as an
introduction to this relatively new field.. If their approach works
gravity will be reformulated using QFT. They have some mad algebra to
go along utilizing renormalization, working with infinities, w/
interesting math-fu around the usage of time. Highly recommended, if
not for the theory, for the underlying technique. Their research ties
to Lifshitz, partly to Fatio / Le Sage.</p>
<p>So here is some hope... it's not all about the same stale,

them is older than your country". Mic drop.</p>
