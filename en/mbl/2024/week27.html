<h1>Week 27</h1>
<p>"@EUCommission@ec.social-network.europa.eu</p>
<p>Apple's new slogan should be 'act different.'</p>
<p>Today, we informed Apple of our preliminary view that its App Store
rules are in breach of the Digital Markets Act, as they prevent app
developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for
offers and content.</p>
<p>We also opened a new non-compliance procedure over concerns that its
new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app
stores fall short of ensuring effective #DMA compliance"</p>

<p>H2 View: "Quantum Dots Boost Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production.. A
paper recently published in the journal Applied Sciences reviewed the
application of quantum dots for photocatalytic [H2]
production.. Carbon quantum dots possess unique electrical and optical
properties.. [they] serve as electron reservoirs to prevent charge
carrier recombination and as photosensitizers to enhance solar light
absorption, leading to improved photocatalytic performance"</p>

<p>TLDR; EPA discovered that Apple was:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>illegally treating hazardous waste</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>illegally transporting hazardous waste to disposal facilities </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>illegally dumping hazardous waste into the ambient air outside the
  facility (into the apartment windows)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>leaving stockpiles of extremely dangerous chemicals unattended on weekends"</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>"@ashleygjovik@mastodon.social</p>
<p>In 2020, I nearly died from mysterious industrial chemical exposure at
my apartment. Later, in 2023, I discovered my employer was dumping
toxic waste into the apartment windows from their Skunkworks
semiconductor fab next-door. I tipped off the US EPA, who sent their
env cops to raid Apple's plant in Aug of 2023. The US EPA finally
released the report of their enforcement inspections &amp; sent me a copy
on Friday"</p>

<p>Hi journalists, it's not an 'AI boom'.</p>
<p>It's an 'AI bubble'.</p>
<p>It doesn't even matter if AI works or not (it doesn't). All the
hallmarks of an economic bubble are there:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Hugely inflated asset prices far beyond their intrinsic value
(NVIDIA is the world's highest capitalized company right now)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Way too much money all chasing just AI companies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Highly speculative behavior trying to strike it rich by waiting to
sell to new investors, despite knowledge that value is highly inflated"</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>Will JB pull a Fetterman and still win, or go down like Dukakis after
that picture on the tank? Trump was fine, looked presidential.</p>
<hr />
<p>Biden debate perf did not look good.. Whoever came up with the format,
picked something that does not work for potus. The muted mics,
interruption-free speak time allows him to go off on tangents get lost
in the woods. </p>

<p>"@GossiTheDog@cyberplace.social</p>
<p>I donâ€™t think any news outlet has picked up on this yet, but Suno -
which is being sued by every major record label for stealing their
artists songs - is baked directly into Microsoft Copilot"</p>
