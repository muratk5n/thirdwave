Software is now (rightfully) considered so dangerous that we tell
everyone not to run it themselves. Instead, you are supposed to leave
that to an 'as a service' provider, or perhaps to 'the cloud'...

The assumption is then that 'the cloud' is somehow able to turn
insecure software into a secure service. Yet even the past year, we’ve
learned that Microsoft’s email platform was thoroughly hacked, down to
classified government email (update: it happened again!). There are
also well-founded worries about the security of the Azure
cloud. Meanwhile, industry darling Okta, which provides LOG IN
SOLUTIONS got comprehensively owned. This was their second breach
within a year. Also, there was a suspicious spate of Okta users
getting hacked subsequently"

CH's A2/AD investments, its big navy, big as in numbers not
necessarily deep sea faring capability, makes more sense for a
regional blockade scenario too. In a hot war many actors in the area
can take potshots at them. With a blockade countries must decide
specifically to break blockade and risk escalation.

Jestrab: "Much of the public discussion around a China-Taiwan conflict
centers on an invasion; however, a number of factors make this the
least likely scenario. The primary reason why an invasion scenario is
unlikely is that it runs contrary to the PRC’s strategic objectives
and reasons for seeking unification. An invasion would result in
significant direct physical violence against the people of Taiwan, the
population that the CCP seeks to rule. Additionally, the PRC gives
priority to economic development as a 'central task' of its continued
growth. An invasion would certainly result in harm to the Chinese
economy due to international sanctions and significant destruction to
Taiwan’s infrastructure and economy.

Geographic factors also make an invasion difficult, including the fact
that two-thirds of the country is rugged mountains and 80 percent of
the population lives in urban environments. Achieving success during
an invasion would likely require preemptive attacks on US and allied
forces, and there would be limited de-escalation options if this
occurred. The historical precedent is that the United States is highly
committed to wars it enters after being attacked. Unlike an invasion
scenario, a blockade could be reversable, and the level of force used
could be adjusted...

A blockade is the most likely and dangerous scenario, due to
Taiwan’s reliance on maritime trade to sustain its economic
prosperity. Moreover, a nonkinetic blockade is appealing to the PRC,
as it is the lowest level of coercive action that could remain below
the threshold of open hostilities and still achieve its national
objectives...

A successful blockade disrupting maritime trade would shutter Taiwan’s
economy. Rationing of scarce energy and food reserves, amplified by a
lack of viable resupply plans, would generate fear and uncertainty
among the Taiwanese population — in sustaining their lives, getting
their next meal, and maintaining their personal economic security. The
PRC’s actions would grind day- to-day life on the island to a
halt. Democracy is more sensitive to economic disruptions than other
forms of government, and a successful blockade could result in panic"

Paper by Marek Jestrab claims a blockade of Taiwan is more likely than
an Chinese invasion of Taiwan. That sounds right.

Hampshire would have been it (and no, avoiding a landslide loss

A win is still a win. Plus it was Haley who had to win this one to
matter in the race. NH electorate on paper should have favored her
more. Democrat leaning less conservative state right? If she won NH
she could have spun that "see I can win among Dem leaning elect, and
I'm conservative enough, so vote for me". The plan did not work.

In other words hydrogen allows Moon to become a gateway to other
planets. Without it the whole concept would be impossible. What a
magic element. 

MIT Technology Review: "The moon is a treasure trove of valuable
resources.. there’s one resource in particular that has
excited.. virtually anyone with a vested interest in making
spaceflight to distant worlds more affordable. It’s water... Why? If
you split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and then liquefy those
constituents, you have rocket fuel. If you can stop at the moon’s
orbit or a lunar base to refuel, you no longer need to bring all your
propellant with you as you take off, making your spacecraft
significantly lighter and cheaper to launch. That’s important because
Earth’s atmosphere and gravitational pull necessitate use of tons of
fuel per second when rockets launch. Creating a sustainable source of
fuel in space could reduce the costs and hazards associated with heavy
liftoffs"

Fermi's Paradox asked 'Where is everybody?'  meaning extraterrestrial
aliens, implying given the vastness of the universe and long time it
has existed, there should be advanced extraterrestrial civilizations
throughout the universe. The Drake equation aimed to answer that
question quantitatively, estimates how many active civilizations there
are in the galaxy right now. Using numbers by Andrew Dessler,

$$
N = R_* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L
$$

$R_*$: Number of civilizations with which humans could
communicate. Recent estimates suggest about 2 new stars are formed in
the Milky Way every year.

$f_P$: The average number of planets that can potentially support life
per star that has planets. Most stars have planets, estimate 0.9.

$N_e$: Assume 1 in 5 of stars with planets has a planet in the
habitable zone, 0.2.

$f_l$, $f_i$, $f_c$ : The fraction of planets that could support life
that actually develop life at some point, develop intelligent life,
and develop a technology that releases detectable signs. Wild guess
all 0.1.

$L$: The length of time for which such civilizations release
detectable signals. Unknown, Dessler assumes advanced civilizations
last for ten million years.

```python
"%d planets" % (2 *  0.9 * 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 10*1e6)
```

```text
Out[1]: '3600 planets'
```

But if "instead of 10,000,000 years, advanced civilizations last only
10,000 years", then

```python
"%d planets" % (2 *  0.9 * 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 10000)
```

```text
Out[1]: '3 planets'
```

If advanced civilizations last on average only 1,000 years, due to,
well perhaps some kind of catastropy hits them all, then

```python
"%0.2f planets" % (2 *  0.9 * 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 1000)
```

```text
Out[1]: '0.36 planets'
```

which shows why we are the only one, and "there is no one else". And
btw we will likely go extinct, lose the civilization we built before
our 1000 years are up due to the climate, nuclear war or some other
artifact of modernity.

That is the answer to "where is everyone?", they are all dead due to
one catastrophy or another, not reaching and staying at the level
where they could contact anyone alive like them (us, in this case).

When you think about it, a lot of the UFO sightings really could be
temperature inversions. Odd light formations are already a feature of
antenna arrays and planes, so the main freaky part is that they'll
appear and move impossibly quickly and completely silently. Rather
than lights (or craft) disobeying the laws of physics, it makes a lot
of sense that between our eyes not working great in the dark and
optical illusions working better with high contrast that we're seeing
a hot air lens"

Imagine mandating a technology where selling points in the dead of
winter are: 1) dont run the heater. 2) dont pay attn to the range
estimate, you could lose 40% of that. 3). Dont let it sit in cold
overnight if its below 20% charge. 4) It might take a long time to
charge when its cold which can be exacerbated by long lines & cars
bricked blocking chargers. 5) Virtually none of the raw materials for
the powertrain come from USA or Europe. They predominantly come from
countries that dont like you"

King David was a myth? 🤣 It's like the King Arthur of Brits.. that
mfka did not exist either.

Wiki: "In 2007.. [researchers] stated that the archaeological evidence
shows that [during the tenth century BCE] Judah was sparsely inhabited
and Jerusalem no more than a small village. The evidence suggested
that David ruled only as a chieftain over an area which cannot be
described as a state or as a kingdom, but more as a chiefdom, much
smaller and always overshadowed by the older and more powerful kingdom
of Israel to the north. They posited that Israel and Judah were not
monotheistic at the time and that later 7th-century redactors sought
to portray a past golden age of a united, monotheistic monarchy in
order to serve contemporary needs"

So Apple loses in court and is now forced to allow developers to offer
a link to pay for the app outside AppStore. So... In response, Apple's
Masters of Evil lawyer team draws up a set of new 'laws' ('give us
full access to your books so we can still take our 1/3 of your revenue
there!') to undermine that ruling and reaffirm their old legally
denied practice...

I have written about the shackles of paying 30% of productivity
software revenue at length—and I have learned that Apple users do
neither understand nor care about indie dev economics as long as they
get a new shiny iPhone next season"

Jake Johnson: "Survey results released Tuesday.. show that nearly
three-quarters of millionaires in G20 countries support higher taxes
on extreme wealth, which they view as an increasingly dire threat to
democracy. The poll was conducted by the London-based firm Survation
on behalf of the Patriotic Millionaires, an advocacy group that
campaigns for a more progressive tax system. The survey, which polled
over 2,300 millionaires in G20 nations, found that 74% 'support higher
taxes on wealth to help address the cost-of-living crisis and improve
public services'...

'We, the very richest, are sick and tired of inaction, so it's hardly
surprising that working people, at the sharp end of our rigged
economies, have lost all patience,' said Guy Singh-Watson, a British
entrepreneur and member of Patriotic Millionaires U.K.

The poll was released as 260 millionaires and billionaires signed a
letter imploring the dozens of world leaders at the World Economic
Forum in Davos to raise taxes on rich people like them, warning that a
continued failure to 'address the dramatic rise of income inequality"
would be "catastrophic for society'"

Stock markets are breaking records, same reason; too much concentrated
wealth looking for assets to buy. Sometimes that is stocks, sometimes
real estate, even crypto - anything with enough liquidity will be a
target.

REIT is an ETF, an indirect way to bet on real-estate

Even Robinhood monkeys are getting into that action. "I'm gonna buy
some REITs broo!"

Look at the median home price.. Clearly a trader needs to bet on asset
prices going up, because the rich is gobbling up assets, their wealth
increases, and they buy more assets.
