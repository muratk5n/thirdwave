really matters in our democracy — the general public, or wealthy
elites?  That's the topic of a recent study by political scientists
Martin Gilens of Princeton and Benjamin Page of Northwestern. The
study's gotten lots of attention over the past year, because the
authors conclude, basically, that the US is a corrupt oligarchy where
ordinary voters barely matter. Or as they put it, 'economic elites and
organized interest groups play a substantial part in affecting public
policy, but the general public has little or no independent

<p>Whistleblower: "Apple's Secret Silicon Fab Next to Thousands of
Homes.. In early 2015, Apple started stealth semiconductor fabrication
activities in a facility located at 3250 Scott Boulevard in Santa
Clara California, less than two hundred feet from thousands of
homes. The factory intentionally vented its exhaust of solvent vapors
and toxic gases straight from the roof and into the ambient outdoor
air, with little or no abatement. The factory was only one story while
the apartments were four stories tall, nearly ensuring the factory
exhaust entered the apartment windows and 'fresh air intake' vents.</p>
<p>​Gjovik lived at these apartments in 2020 and found herself in the
emergency room within one week, disabled by symptoms of solvent and
gas exposure. Later in 2020, Gjovik conducted air testing and
bio-monitoring which found the presence of Apple's factory exhaust
inside her home, and inside her body"</p>

<p>Doctorow: "The Cult of Mac: You cannot reason a person out of a
position they did not reason themself into in the first place...</p>
<p>Big Tech most assuredly steals from the news: it steals money. The
ad-tech duopoly takes 51% out of every ad dollar. Social media holds
news subscribers to ransom and requires "boosting" payment to reach
the people who've asked to see their articles. And the mobile duopoly
takes 30% out of every in-app subscription dollar:</p>
<p>The mobile duopoly likes to talk about the "mobile ecosystem," but
it's no ecosystem – it's a pair of walled gardens:</p>
<p>It's a planned economy run by a pair of corporate executives who
deliberate in secret and are accountable only to their
shareholders. Thankfully, some regulators are alive to the hazards of
this technofeudal arrangement and are taking firm measures:</p>
<p>These regulators couch their enforcement action in terms of defending
an open market, but the benefits to app makers is only incidental. The
real beneficiaries of an open app world is Apple customers. After all,
it's Apple customers who bear the 30% app tax when it's priced into
the apps they buy and the things they buy in those apps. It's Apple
customers who lose access to apps that can't be viably offered because
the app tax makes them money-losing propositions. It's Apple customers
who lose out on the ability to get apps that Apple decides are
unsuitable for inclusion in its App Store.</p>
<p>That's where the Cult Of Mac steps in to cape for the $3 trillion
behemoth. The minority of Apple customers for whom their brand loyalty
is a form of religious devotion insist that "no Apple customer wants
these things."</p>
<p>This is such obvious nonsense that it can only be described as an
article of faith, not a reasoned position"</p>

<p>Americans usually look at EU laws from their by-the-letter, precedence
based common law, not expecting the in-spirit approach of
non-Anglo-Saxon civil law. Even Apple's response was typically
American—trying to find sophist gaps in the wording, complying in a
'clever' way ('Look, I do just what you said! Happy now?'). While I
don't expect American tech bloggers to understand European law or how
they pedal populist anti EU propaganda, I expected more from Apple's
lawyers"</p>

<p>"In 1987, [new junta leader supported by US] Namphy received IMF loans
valued at $24.6 million in exchange for agreeing to slash rice tariffs
from 150% to 50%, the lowest in the Caribbean. He opened all of
Haiti’s ports to commercial activity and agreed to stop what little
support the government had offered Haitian farmers. Meanwhile, Haiti’s
military elite saw an opportunity to make a profit smuggling American
rice.. In the United States, the passage of the 1985 Farm Bill
significantly boosted subsidies to American rice growers. By 1987, 40%
of American rice growers' profits came from the government. Heavily
subsidized American rice could sell at prices far below the market
value of Haitian rice. Haitian farmers never stood a chance against
this unfair competition".. In Haiti, imported American rice is called
'Miami rice' because it is shipped from Miami in sacks stamped 'Miami,
FLA.' By December 1987, Haiti’s rice production had shrunk to 75% of
Haitian needs"</p>

<em>Self-Determining Haiti</em> [where] Johnson’s assessment of the US
occupation (1915–1934), by then in its fifth year, was searing..</p>
<p>For Johnson a single institution and a single individual were
responsible for the US intervention: the National City Bank of New
York - the precursor to the contemporary financial services leviathan
Citigroup - and its vice president Roger Leslie Farnham... [he wrote]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]o understand why the United States landed and has for five years
maintained military forces in that country, why some three thousand
Haitian men, women, and children have been shot down by American
rifles and machine guns, it is necessary, among other things, to know
that the National City Bank of New York is very much interested in
Haiti. It is necessary to know that the National City Bank controls
the National Bank of Haiti and is the depository for all of the
Haitian national funds that are being collected by American
officials, and that Mr. R. L. Farnham, vice-president of the National
City Bank, is virtually the representative of the State Department in
matters relating to the island republic"</p>
