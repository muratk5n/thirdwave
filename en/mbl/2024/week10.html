<p>Ground News: "Depreciation is hitting EVs harder than most other
vehicles. A combination of technology upgrades, price fluctuations on
new cars, and lack of demand has meant a rapid drop in value for many
electric models. This phenomenon is especially dramatic for Porsche‚Äôs
Taycan EV, with high-spec Turbo models losing almost $100,000 in value
within four years"</p>

<p>Chris Hedges: "Aaron Bushnell, when he placed his cell phone on the
ground to set up a livestream and lit himself on fire in front of the
Israeli Embassy in Washington D.C., resulting in his death, pitted
divine violence against radical evil. As an active duty member of the
U.S. Air Force, he was part of the vast machinery that sustains the
ongoing genocide in Gaza..</p>
<p>'Many of us like to ask ourselves,' he posted shortly before his
suicide, 'What would I do if I was alive during slavery? Or the Jim
Crow South? Or apartheid? What would I do if my country was committing
genocide? The answer is, you‚Äôre doing it. Right now.'..</p>
<p>Bushnell‚Äôs self-immolation ‚Äî one most social media posts and news
organizations have heavily censored ‚Äî is the point. It is meant to be
seen. Bushnell extinguished his life in the same way thousands of
Palestinians, including children, have been extinguished. We could
watch him burn to death. This is what it looks like. This is what
happens to Palestinians because of us"</p>

<p>Nature: "Direct solar-driven water splitting by photocatalysis or
photoelectrolysis offers a very promising route to produce green
hydrogen. Among different configurations of photoactive materials, the
bioinspired concept of 'Z-scheme photoactive film' enables
visible-light-driven water splitting by combining two different
photoactive materials in series to separately produce H2 and O2 in
tandem photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells or photocatalytic panels has
demonstrated its great effectivenss. Their scale-up and commercial
applications though require low-cost, stable, efficient, and scalable
photoactive films...</p>
<p>Inspired by the cellular structure of the thylakoid membrane of
chloroplasts in plant cells.. in this study, a facile and scalable
particle-implanting (PiP) fabrication technique of embedding
semiconductor particles in low-melting-point (LMP) liquid metal
matrixes was developed to produce bioinspired photoactive films"</p>

<p>I axed one of those chat parrots to categorize a text about a criminal
getting a sentence due past hard crimes in an actor-action-actor
format, like GDELT does for news items, basically asking for "A does B
to C" type of output. Chat parrot totally made up one side of the
action, said "families of the victims" brought the guy to court, the
text had none of that. Related news on that exact event elsewhere had
none of that. That answer was likely computed based on the gobs of
texts it ingested earlier on similar stories, which led the parrot to
hallucinate.</p>

this rationale that BEV technology ages faster?'..</p>
<p>My guesses for why BEVs depreciate faster:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Battery longevity past eight year warranty is still up in the air..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BEV-exclusive components / parts are more expensive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Longer wait time for repairs and fewer options</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduction in driving range due to inevitable degradation..</p>
</li>
<li>
