<p>Waber, Harvard Business Review: "Is GenAI‚Äôs Impact on Productivity
Overblown? Generative AI like LLMs have been touted as a boon to
collective productivity. But the authors argue that leaning into the
hype too much could be a mistake. Assessments of productivity
typically focus on the task level and how individuals might use and
benefit from LLMs. Using such findings to draw broad conclusions about
firm-level performance could prove costly. The authors argue that
leaders need to understand two core problems of LLMs before adopting
them company-wide: 1) their persistent ability to produce convincing
falsities and 2) the likely long-term negative effects of using LLMs
on employees and internal processes"</p>

<hr />
<p>Stevenson, <em>The Trading Game</em>: "[The presenter] had a bunch of
charts. He went through them one at a time. On each one was the fiscal
situation of a single country. Italy. Spain. Greece.
Portugal. Ireland. Also the United Kingdom, the US, Japan [around
2011].  They were all variations on the same story. All these
governments were spending more than their income year after year and
their debts were growing... I couldn‚Äôt get it out of my head.. a sense
of similarity. It was the same. The government of Spain, the
government of America, the government of Japan. The situation was just
like [a friend's] mum.. Outgoings more than their income. Losing the
ability to borrow money. More and more income going into servicing
debt.  Losing their assets. The situation was the same. It wasn‚Äôt just
[another friend] with holes in his shoes, it was the world.</p>
<p>But it came up against the economics though.. [w]e‚Äôre in a monetary
system. The whole thing always has to be in balance. For everyone
who‚Äôs in debt, there‚Äôs someone who‚Äôs in credit. For everybody losing
money, there‚Äôs somebody who‚Äôs gaining. The whole system is designed to
be in balance. Not only that, but what about the houses?  What about
the stock market that was rising and rising? These assets weren‚Äôt
disappearing. But if we didn‚Äôt own them, if the people didn‚Äôt own
them, and the governments didn‚Äôt own them...Then who did?</p>
<p>And that was it, I think, that was the moment that it hit me,
surrounded by millionaires.. I looked to the left of me. Pink shirt,
pink shirt, white, sky blue. I looked to the right of me. White shirt,
white shirt, pink, ooh, pinstripes, don‚Äôt see much of that
nowadays. There, in string, sewn into a collar, four letters:
'A.I.E.Q.'  Who the fuck‚Äôs surname begins with a Q?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Streeck, <em>How Will Capitalism End?</em>: "Oligarchic redistribution and
the trend toward plutonomy, even in countries that are still
considered democracies, conjure up the nightmare of elites confident
that they will outlive the social system that is making them
rich. Plutonomic capitalists may no longer have to worry about
national economic growth because their transnational fortunes grow
without it; hence the exit of the super-rich from countries.. take
their money ‚Äì or that of their fellow citizens ‚Äì and run, preferably
to Switzerland, Britain or the United States. The possibility, as
provided by a global capital market, of rescuing yourself and your
family by exiting together with your possessions offers the strongest
possible temptation for the rich to move into endgame mode ‚Äì cash in,
burn bridges, and leave nothing behind but scorched earth.</p>
<p>Closely related to this is the third disorder, the plundering of the
public domain through underfunding and privatization. I have elsewhere
traced its origin to the twofold transition since the 1970s from the
tax state to the debt state to, finally, the consolidation or
austerity state. Foremost among the causes of this shift were the new
opportunities offered by global capital markets since the 1980s for
tax flight, tax evasion, tax-regime shopping and the extortion of tax
cuts from governments by corporations and earners of high
incomes. Attempts to close public deficits relied almost exclusively
on cuts in government spending ‚Äì both to social security and to
investment in physical infrastructures and human capital. As income
gains accrued increasingly to the top 1 per cent, the public domain of
capitalist economies shrank, often dramatically, starved in favour of
internationally mobile oligarchic wealth. Part of the process was
privatization, carried out regardless of the contribution public
investment in productivity and social cohesion might have made to
economic growth and social equity"</p>
<hr />
<p>Taxing the rich, trickle-down econ parts were good #SOTU</p>
<hr />
<p>It didn't look much of a union to me #SOTU, with potus firing zingers
arguing with some in the crowd, live. That's ok.. But it shows
previous appeals to unity were bunk, a waste of time, it is not about
unity, it is about your ideology gaining power and pushing through its
agenda. You can usually find a middle ground between A and B, but
constant appeals to "going bi" was not about that, it was about the
left being pushed <em>preemptively</em> to some middle and from there they
would be pushed towards further right still. The "preemptive
middle-ground seekers" were essentially asked to fall in line, not be
part of a larger solution.</p>

merger, when there was a competitive market, Boeing was a wonderful

has always been less a business than an association of engineers
devoted to building amazing flying machines'"</p>

<p>Streeck, <em>How Will Capitalism End?</em>: "Neoliberal ideology supports
migration and open borders in the name of personal liberty and human
rights, knowing that it provides employers in the receiving countries
with an unlimited labour supply, thereby destabilizing protective
labour regimes. Ethnic diversity is welcomed, not only by the liberal
middle class, but also by employers desiring docile workers that are
grateful for being allowed to be where they are, and anxious to avoid
deportation for becoming unemployed or engaging in militant
activities.  Immigration thus makes the collective organization of
workers difficult, especially in low-income occupations. It can also
be used propagandistically to enlist indigenous workers‚Äô sense of
solidarity for neoliberal policies aimed at abolishing minimum wages
and employment protections, by accusing trade unions of racist
discrimination against ‚Äòoutsiders‚Äô for the benefit of ‚Äòinsiders‚Äô.  If
then the labour market interests of the indigenous working class are
articulated by right-wing populist parties and movements, labour
protection suffers further de-legitimation while the working class
becomes even more divided"</p>

any barrier. And with that, so too will the power of the wealthy
accumulate, including their ability to shape policymaking and
government for their own benefit..</p>
<p>It‚Äôs always possible to shrug off the risk of an entrenched
plutocracy. To believe that whether a few super-rich own a large
fraction of the country‚Äôs wealth is irrelevant. That America‚Äôs
institutions are so strong that they cannot be captured by special
interests. That from Boston to Los Angeles, democracy will always and
forever beat plutocracy. And certainly, democracy has overcome
plutocracy in the past. It triumphed over the slaveholding plutocracy
of the South. It beat back the nascent industrialist plutocracy of the

<p>I axed one of those chat parrots to categorize a text about a criminal
getting a sentence due past hard crimes in an actor-action-actor
format, like GDELT does for news items, basically asking for "A does B
to C" type of output. Chat parrot totally made up one side of the
action, said "families of the victims" brought the guy to court, the
text had none of that. Related news on that exact event elsewhere had
none of that. That answer was likely computed based on the gobs of
texts it ingested earlier on similar stories, which led the parrot to
hallucinate.</p>

<p>Quora: "'Why is the depreciation curve for BEVs steeper? What's with
this rationale that BEV technology ages faster?'..</p>
<p>My guesses for why BEVs depreciate faster:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Battery longevity past eight year warranty is still up in the air..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>BEV-exclusive components / parts are more expensive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Longer wait time for repairs and fewer options</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduction in driving range due to inevitable degradation..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(empty?) promises in upcoming battery chemistry improvements..</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less demand - significant premium over ICEV, limited form factors,
  creeping insurance premiums</p>
</li>
</ul>
