<p>One viewpoint blames Germany and Austria-Hungary but France-Russia had
their own worries to partake in a war. A-H had annexed Bosnia, which
angered Serbia whose big daddy was, as it is now, Russia who wanted
access to the seas. The Balkan Wars were likely
<a href="https://youtu.be/9KESpCFmYMk?t=277">encouraged</a> by Russians, Serbia
ended up with more territory w Ottomans losing it, and Serbian
nationalistic dislike against A-H never went away. Basically the
Balkans were contested territory for the empires, who were by now
armed to the teeth and with new industrialised mobilization techniques
were afraid if you did not mobilize first you would lose. And everyone
feared the rising power Germany. The perfect storm.</p>

<p>Catholic Herald: "[03/01] Pope talks of ‘courage to negotiate’ to end

<p>Hossein-Zadeh: "It does not follow.. as some critics argue, the
U.S.–Israeli relationship represents a case of 'tail wagging the dog,'
that is, the U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East is shaped by the
Israeli/Zionist leaders. Nor do I subscribe to the hoary anti-Semitic
canards that are used to put forth a specious case for Jews trying to
run the world. While, no doubt, the powerful Jewish lobby exerts
considerable influence over U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East,
the efficacy and the extent of that influence depend, ultimately, on
the real economic and geopolitical interests of U.S. foreign policy
makers. In other words, U.S. policy makers in the Middle East would go
along with the demands of the radical Zionist lobby only if such
demands also tend to serve the special interests that those policy
makers represent or serve—not necessarily the interests of the
American people, or collective U.S. 'national interests' in
general. The fact that, as pointed out earlier, U.S. foreign policy
during the Cold War era was less accommodating to the territorial
desires of militant Zionism than in the post–Cold War period is an
indication of this point. Another corroborating indication of the
point is that as the military-industrial complex has been gaining more
and more influence over U.S. foreign policy, that policy has,
accordingly, been more and more geared to the wishes of hard-line
Zionism because, as has been frequently pointed out in this chapter,
the interests of the U.S.  military establishment converge with those
of militant Zionism over war and political convulsion in the Middle
East"</p>

typically focus on the task level and how individuals might use and

<p>Stevenson, <em>The Trading Game</em>: "[The presenter] had a bunch of
charts. He went through them one at a time. On each one was the fiscal
situation of a single country. Italy. Spain. Greece.
Portugal. Ireland. Also the United Kingdom, the US, Japan [around
2011].  They were all variations on the same story. All these
governments were spending more than their income year after year and
their debts were growing... I couldn’t get it out of my head.. a sense
of similarity. It was the same. The government of Spain, the
government of America, the government of Japan. The situation was just
like [a friend's] mum.. Outgoings more than their income. Losing the
ability to borrow money. More and more income going into servicing
debt.  Losing their assets. The situation was the same. It wasn’t just
[another friend] with holes in his shoes, it was the world.</p>
<p>But it came up against the economics though.. [w]e’re in a monetary
system. The whole thing always has to be in balance. For everyone
who’s in debt, there’s someone who’s in credit. For everybody losing
money, there’s somebody who’s gaining. The whole system is designed to
be in balance. Not only that, but what about the houses?  What about
the stock market that was rising and rising? These assets weren’t
disappearing. But if we didn’t own them, if the people didn’t own
them, and the governments didn’t own them...Then who did?</p>
<p>And that was it, I think, that was the moment that it hit me,
surrounded by millionaires.. I looked to the left of me. Pink shirt,
pink shirt, white, sky blue. I looked to the right of me. White shirt,
white shirt, pink, ooh, pinstripes, don’t see much of that
nowadays. There, in string, sewn into a collar, four letters:
'A.I.E.Q.'  Who the fuck’s surname begins with a Q?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Streeck, <em>How Will Capitalism End?</em>: "Oligarchic redistribution and
the trend toward plutonomy, even in countries that are still
considered democracies, conjure up the nightmare of elites confident
that they will outlive the social system that is making them
rich. Plutonomic capitalists may no longer have to worry about
national economic growth because their transnational fortunes grow
without it; hence the exit of the super-rich from countries.. take
their money – or that of their fellow citizens – and run, preferably
to Switzerland, Britain or the United States. The possibility, as
provided by a global capital market, of rescuing yourself and your
family by exiting together with your possessions offers the strongest
possible temptation for the rich to move into endgame mode – cash in,
burn bridges, and leave nothing behind but scorched earth.</p>
<p>Closely related to this is the third disorder, the plundering of the
public domain through underfunding and privatization. I have elsewhere
traced its origin to the twofold transition since the 1970s from the
tax state to the debt state to, finally, the consolidation or
austerity state. Foremost among the causes of this shift were the new
opportunities offered by global capital markets since the 1980s for
tax flight, tax evasion, tax-regime shopping and the extortion of tax
cuts from governments by corporations and earners of high
incomes. Attempts to close public deficits relied almost exclusively
on cuts in government spending – both to social security and to
investment in physical infrastructures and human capital. As income
gains accrued increasingly to the top 1 per cent, the public domain of
capitalist economies shrank, often dramatically, starved in favour of
internationally mobile oligarchic wealth. Part of the process was
privatization, carried out regardless of the contribution public
investment in productivity and social cohesion might have made to
economic growth and social equity"</p>
<hr />
<p>Taxing the rich, trickle-down econ parts were good #SOTU</p>
<hr />
<p>It didn't look much of a union to me #SOTU, with potus firing zingers
arguing with some in the crowd, live. That's ok.. But it shows
previous appeals to unity were bunk, a waste of time, it is not about
unity, it is about your ideology gaining power and pushing through its
agenda. You can usually find a middle ground between A and B, but
constant appeals to "going bi" was not about that, it was about the
left being pushed <em>preemptively</em> to some middle and from there they
would be pushed towards further right still. The "preemptive
middle-ground seekers" were essentially asked to fall in line, not be
part of a larger solution.</p>

<p>Streeck, <em>How Will Capitalism End?</em>: "Neoliberal ideology supports
migration and open borders in the name of personal liberty and human
rights, knowing that it provides employers in the receiving countries
with an unlimited labour supply, thereby destabilizing protective
labour regimes. Ethnic diversity is welcomed, not only by the liberal
middle class, but also by employers desiring docile workers that are
grateful for being allowed to be where they are, and anxious to avoid
deportation for becoming unemployed or engaging in militant
activities.  Immigration thus makes the collective organization of
workers difficult, especially in low-income occupations. It can also
be used propagandistically to enlist indigenous workers’ sense of
solidarity for neoliberal policies aimed at abolishing minimum wages
and employment protections, by accusing trade unions of racist
discrimination against ‘outsiders’ for the benefit of ‘insiders’.  If
then the labour market interests of the indigenous working class are
articulated by right-wing populist parties and movements, labour
protection suffers further de-legitimation while the working class
becomes even more divided"</p>

if I had wanted it to be open access, it would have cost <em>$1500.</em> To
an adjunct junior academic, you might as well be asking for a
kidney. This is genuinely huge"</p>

for that. But we cannot expect an FDR like figure from the Republican

<p>Zucman: "In 2018, for the first time in the last hundred years, the
top 400 richest Americans have paid lower tax rates than the working
class.. This looks like the tax system of a plutocracy. With tax rates
of barely 20% at the top, wealth will keep accumulating with hardly
any barrier. And with that, so too will the power of the wealthy
accumulate, including their ability to shape policymaking and
government for their own benefit..</p>
<p>It’s always possible to shrug off the risk of an entrenched
plutocracy. To believe that whether a few super-rich own a large
fraction of the country’s wealth is irrelevant. That America’s
institutions are so strong that they cannot be captured by special
interests. That from Boston to Los Angeles, democracy will always and
forever beat plutocracy. And certainly, democracy has overcome
plutocracy in the past. It triumphed over the slaveholding plutocracy
of the South. It beat back the nascent industrialist plutocracy of the
Gilded Age. In one case it took a war; in the other a tax revolution"</p>

<p>Bushnell’s self-immolation — one most social media posts and news

seen. Bushnell extinguished his life in the same way thousands of

none of that. That answer was likely computed based on the gobs of
