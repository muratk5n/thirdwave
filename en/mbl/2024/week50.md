# Week 50


Geoship Spox: "Everybody realizes that home construction is
broken. It's actually worse than broken, this is an industry that's
been moving backwards in the last 50 years. It costs four times as
much to build a home and it takes twice as long"

---

Since the "developed" world also has an housing crisis thanks to
unfettered immigration and the rich gobbling up homes as investments,
if you can do anything on the supply side it can't be through
business-as-usual methods. Radical new approaches are needed.

Producing housing should be no different than producing coke bottles.
Factories spit out the latter in the billions, same can be done for
housing components given we have the right infrastructure, and the
right design. One of the stable designs is the geodesic approach, the
shape is strong, will work in hurricane hit areas, can be built fast,
insulation is easily achieved (there is outer shell, inner shell, the
gap in between is filled with insulation material, eg wool). Assembly
is done bottom up, component by component, the geometry of the
structure is inherently sturdy and strong.

Bioceramics, chemically bonded ceramics are of a similar material that
makes the human bone. They are strong, natural, do not burn or
corrode. The research into the material was conducted by the
government (of course -US National labs-) now some binnesses use them
for home construction. Morgan Bierschenk, Geoship are noteworthy here,
they can manufacture components off-site via injection molding,
components are shipped to house site, and assembled by workers there
in a matter of weeks. No complicated construction process needed.

Bioceramics are healthy, people who spend a few nights at one of those
geodomes say they had the best sleep of their lives, they feel the
health effects around them immediately. According to a spox "we have
800 toxic chemicals in common construction materials.. almost 50% of
homes will test positive for black mold.. these things are leading to
chronic disease.. your home that you spend the most time in is one of
the things that is contributing to the rise of [construction material
toxicity epidemic]".

Bioceramic based geodesic dome house construction.. It has future.

---

Russia was preoccupied but they might have been promised certain
things, their base, navy port, and they had their issues with Assad so
maybe they are okay with the change of the guard.. Did they follow the
same pattern as in Armenia/Azerbaijan (for the longest time they sold
weapons to both sides, and once Armenia made some pro-EU noises, they
had the shit kicked out of them, lost major territory).

---

It appears recent events are tied to outgoing Dems again. With one
last gasp they greenlit the op, Assad is finally gone. Israel must be
happy. But they might not enjoy the chaos that can follow.

---

With the coup TR non-interventionism was reversed. They pushed the
bitch, pushed the bitch, and the bitch got broken.

---

See my [timeline](0119/2017/12/timeline-syria-tr.html) of Syria
events, TR incursion happened right after the coup attempt, and the
attempt caused a major expulsion of officers who were against the
incursion in Syria (some think pro-NATO officers were expelled, this
is not true).

The following events took place just in 2016 BTW, I copy-pasted that
block, without taking anything out, there was nothing notable
happening in between them. Note there was a soon-outgoing Democrat
administration, right before Trump. The Black Bill Clinton is in the
WH at that point. Now Trump is about to step in, and Dems are on the
way out. Do we notice a rhyme?

- 15/07: TR coup attempt
- 17/08: TR announces interest in buying Russian S-400 defense system
- 20/08: A wedding is bombed killing 54 civilians and injured 94 in
  the southeastern TR city of Gaziantep many of whom are Kurdish,
  Syria connected jihadis were suspected
- 24/08: TR military offensive into northern Syria starts with US support
- 04/11: Demirta≈ü, a pro-Kurdish party leader arrested 
- 19/12: Russian Ambassador to TR assasinated

As can be noticed, anti-Kurd, pro-anti-Russia items are interspersed
in there.. This has been the "new Turkey" of late.

---

Asia Minor for the longest time was non-interventionist. But bcz it is
US' bitch it got pushed into many things.

---

Sure Syria and Iraq had phony governmental structures, in Iraq Sunni
leader (Saddam) was running a Shite majority country, in Syria a Shite
minority (Assads) were ruling over a Sunni majority. After Shites came
to power in Iraq it would only make sense the same for Sunnis would
happen in Syria.

But it was wrong to work towards that goal, as it created much
carnage, Russia got involved, triggered a refugee crisis, it became a
big hot mess. We'll see how future events shape up, if Syria becomes a
better place to make the effort worth it. It doesn't look good at the
moment.

---

Assad's precondition for any talk was the return of taken land by TR
sponsored groups, TR wasn't too warm to the idea, so there wasn't much
to this "thaw" in reality.

"There was a thaw between Syria and TR, why would the latter have
organized the rebels against Assad?"
