S&P Global: "Europeâ€™s steel industry is set to be a significant
consumer of renewable hydrogen and German steelmakers in particular
have some of the most advanced plans in the region to tap the new
green energy source.

Potential future demand from the German steel sector could amount to
850,000 metric tons per year by 2030, according to German steel
association WV Stahl, with producers planning to connect to a national
hydrogen pipeline network now under construction, as well as producing
their own green hydrogen from electrolyzers onsite, saving 28 t of CO2
per metric ton of hydrogen"

Casimir effect can generate 1 atm pressure between neutral plates 10
nm apart. That is a strong force..  and it is basically free energy,
generated due to quantum fluctuations in the aether. Could that be
harnessed somehow? Via nano scale turbine generators?

"I looked into [the] character [of VVD]". You auditioned for this
exact role in the 2000s..  ðŸ¤¨? C'mon Doomney.

---

Not only it's late for an accurate VVD, IMHO if done, it would be
boring. VVD story relates to Fantastic Four, who are like, a family..
Two members are siblings, the sister Sue is married to Reed, and VVD
is jealous of that? Boring. He wants Reed's family, so he wants to be
the dad and tell dad jokes all day long? Boooorriiiing.. Oh and comic
accurate means Victor knows magic, Mephisto has his mother he tries to
free her, is the king of some distant country that is not even briefly
mentioned in any movie yet..

---

Rumors abound after *The Holywood Reporter* interview 'doing VVD
right' that Doom will be a comic-book accurate. I still see no reason
for RDJ to come back for a role unless it is for a variant of earlier
roles. THR comments might be aiming to blow smoke up your ass..

There is a deep culture of "hackiness" in Britain.. Many of the hacks
I spot these days happen to be English. Some dimwit half-brain
broken-record just selling it, blindly, in a rat-a-tat-tat commentary,
"my team your team" style, pure monologue, w/ zero proof for
brains.. US surely got that aspect of their politics from UK. Where
does UK's hack culture come from?  A need of the plebs to pledge
fealty to some kind of power center (royalty before, plutocrat now)
because their livelihood depended on it? And now the plebs turned
commentators.

Noncompete aggrements were ban for companies poaching each other's
employees. FTC banned the ban, then federal judge struck down the ban
on the ban, meaning private companies can still own your ass.

---

The Verge: "A federal judge has blocked the Federal Trade Commissionâ€™s
ban on noncompete agreements that make it difficult for workers to
join their employersâ€™ rivals or launch competing businesses. The
ruling prevents the FTCâ€™s ban on noncompete agreements from taking
effect on September 4th, though the agency could still appeal the
decision."

from President Joe Bidenâ€™s antitrust policy, the Democratic Party
seems to be doubling down. The word 'competition' comes up 18 times in
the partyâ€™s 2024 platform, compared to nine in theÂ 2020 version. Other
key policy areas, like tackling junk feesÂ andÂ noncompetes, are
mentioned several times in the 2024 platform as well, compared to just
one passing reference to noncompetes in the 2020 document. Notably,
those are areas where the Federal Trade Commission, led by Lina Khan â€”
a target of ire from moreÂ business-minded Democrats like Reid Hoffman
â€” has been instrumental"

If the experience of the past few decades taught us anything it is

SCMP: "China sets launch date for worldâ€™s first thorium molten salt
nuclear power station.. Construction of a molten salt nuclear power
plant that uses thorium as fuel instead of uranium is set to begin in
the Gobi Desert.. The reactor does not need water for cooling because
it uses liquid salt and carbon dioxide to transfer heat and generate
electricity.

Using thorium as its primary fuel, it means worries over a potential
shortage of uranium â€“ the usual fuel used in nuclear reactors â€“ are
allayed, as thorium is more abundant than uranium. According to some
scientistsâ€™ estimates, China has enough thorium reserves to meet its
energy needs for 20,000 years. The reactor is scheduled to be
completed and operational in 2029, generating heat at a maximum power
of 60 megawatts.

Part of the thermal energy will drive a 10MW electric power unit, and
the rest will produce hydrogen by splitting water molecules at high
temperature"

Robert Dicke: "[1956] Gravitation without a principle of
equivalance.. By analogy with electromagnetic or meson force fields it
is reasonable to expect that when viewed sufficiently closely the
gravitational effects would be quantum in nature. Stated more exactly,
it might be expected that the gravitational force acting on an
elementary particle would have its origin in a local interaction of
the particle with virtual particles present in the vacuum...

Remembering the virtual electron-positron pairs reputed to be present
in the vacuum as a result of zero point fluctuations, it becomes
interesting to inquire whether the gravitational effect can be linked
to these particles already present. If so, it should be possible
eventually to construct a theory of particles and obtain the
gravitational interaction as a weak effect connected with more
primitive strong interactions...

Gravitation an electromagnetic effect? The fact that many of the
properties of gravitation can be accounted for in terms of an
interaction with a polarizable medium is an old idea which has
recurred from time to time. The physical idea is simply that a space
variation in the polarizabilities of the vacuum will lead to a number
of results familiar as typical gravitation effects. For example, an
increase of the index of refraction of the vacuum in the vicinity of
the sun will cause a bending of light toward the sun"

The Hindu Businessline: "[2023/02] Clean energy and hydrogen. Why
Thorium is key to our net zero goals.. BARC is working on several
technologies for using thorium, of which two are noteworthy. One is
the â€˜Indian high-temperature reactorâ€™ (IHTR), which is designed to
produce heat and, in turn, produce hydrogen through the
â€˜sulphur-iodineâ€™ method. In this process, sulphuric acid decomposes
into oxygen, sulphur dioxide and water under high temperature. When
iodine is added to sulphur dioxide and water, you get hydrogen iodide,
which again splits into hydrogen and iodine at high temperatures"

Thorium is more abundant than uranium, it generates less nuclear
waste.

The Hindu Businessline: "[2023/02] Bhabha Atomic Research Centreâ€™s 5MW

There is a subtext to WSJ's reporting on the sabotage now; maybe the
Kursk incursion is seen by them as "some crazy shit" and they are
reminding the readers other "crazy shit" that current UA leadership
pulled off in the past, you are being defined in a certain way... That
means UA could be creating new enemies, outside the usual corners of
US right, and that does not bode well for them.

We'd mentioned this possibility [before](../2023/week24.html).
Labeled as the "B Scenario" it is probably more likely the sabotage

and both Zelensk and the (now fired) UAF ex-chief are at the right age

sabotage is a "cool thing" to do.

The Guardian: "According to the WSJ, the [Nordstream] sabotage
operation involved a small sailing boat and a team of six people, a
combination of Ukrainian soldiers and civilians with relevant
expertise. The operation used private funding but was directed by a
serving army general, who reported to Ukraineâ€™s then commander in
chief, Valerii Zaluzhnyi. Zelenskiy approved the plan, but later
backtracked after the CIA found out about it and asked Kyiv to call it
off, according to the WSJâ€™s sources. Nonetheless, Zaluzhnyi pressed
ahead with the mission, the report claims"

Tay Zonday: "There is no American 'housing crisis' - there's a
supply-hoarding crisis to rig local market prices above the liquidity
of local buyer capital.

The policy solution is simple: poison-pill tax all non-occupant-owned
housing to force immediate sale to local buyers at actual market
rates.

Allowing unlimited non-local capital to supply-hoard vacant housing is
simply anti-resident eugenics. Current residents are too poor, so
replace them with richer ones - even if it causes widespread
homelessness, forced migration and absurd energy costs for the
displaced to commute. It's as discriminatory as Federal Housing
Administration redlining of black neighborhoods in the 40s"

---

The part on corps being involved in real-estate market denying new
buyers access was good..  Most of the housing crisis has to do w/ the
rich taking more assets than they can use. "Building more homes"
cannot be the primary fix. As long as inequality exists, those new
homes will be bought by the same corps as an investment.

---

"Opportunity economy" sounded somewhat Clintonesque.. Was that a cover
for "populism"?

Politico: "The vice president Friday briefly touted the economic
progress and accomplishments under the Biden administration.. but she
said she knows many Americans arenâ€™t yet feeling improving conditions.

'Costs are still too high. And on a deeper level, no matter how much
they work, it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead,' she
said. 'As president, I will be laser-focused on creating opportunities
for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability
and dignity...'

Harris... has also leaned further into aggressive attacks on
corporations for 'price gouging' and driving up prices at the grocery
store. And she has filtered well-worn ideas through a new,
unapologetically [lefty] lens.

That has made for a striking contrast from Biden, who never completely
warmed to efforts to shift the blame for inflation to big business and
often softened his own populist rhetoric with reassurances that he was
a 'capitalist.'"
