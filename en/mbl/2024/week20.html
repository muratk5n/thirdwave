Massively bad.  It would be great if all of N. Africa was greened,
that could hold the dust in place. That would be a hard undertaking
for sure.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Africa experiences some of the worst air pollution and some of the
most severe health consequences in the world. In 2019, air pollution
was the second leading risk factor for death across Africa, a large
and dynamic continent that is home to more than 1.2 billion people. In
terms of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5), 5 of the world’s 10
most heavily polluted countries are in Africa.. Desert dust, also
referred to as sand and dust storms, is a mixture of particulate
matter from desert or arid areas. In the Sahara and Sahel regions of
North Africa, as well as in Western Africa, windblown dust is a
significant contributor to total PM2.5"</p>

<hr />
<p>Hinton, LeCun are two of the three "Godfathers of AI" - the press
keeps conflating one approach in machine learning with all of AI, but
anyway, as far as deep neural nets go, these guys are the top. Perhaps
LeCun more so than the rest.</p>
<hr />
<p>Godfather Fight!</p>
<hr />
<p>LeCun [to Hinton]: "One thing we know is that if future AI systems are
built on the same blueprint as current Auto-Regressive LLMs, they may
become highly knowledgeable but they will still be dumb. They will
still hallucinate, they will still be difficult to control, and they
will still merely regurgitate stuff they've been trained on. MORE
IMPORTANTLY, they will still be unable to reason, unable to invent new
things, or to plan actions to fulfill objectives. And unless they can
be trained from video, they still won't understand the physical
world. Future systems will <em>have</em> to use a different architecture
capable of understanding the world, capable of reasoning, and capable
of planning so as to satisfy a set of objectives and guardrails. These
objective-driven architectures will be safe and will remain under our
control because <em>we</em> set their objectives and guardrails"</p>
<hr />
<p>Geoffrey Hinton: "Companies are planning to train models with 100x
more computation than today's state of the art, within 18 months. No
one knows how powerful they will be. And there's essentially no
regulation on what they'll be able to do with these models"</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Evil Geniuses</em>: "Except for Google, Facebook, and Intel, cable TV and
high-speed Internet providers, and Monsanto in much of
agribusiness.. few of the resulting corporate giants are literal
monopolies, one company absolutely dominating a given sector. Instead,
most major American industries have rapidly turned into oligopolies,
where two or three or four big companies run their show and tend not
to compete fiercely. It’s like how smart mob families peacefully
coexist.  During the 1990s and 2000s, three-quarters of all
U.S. industries became more concentrated, and their average level of
concentration doubled. Oligopoly is now the American way in mobile and
landline phone service, airlines, credit cards, meat and poultry, beer
and soft drinks, breakfast cereal, and more. In the 1990s the six
biggest banks held only one-sixth of all Americans’ financial assets,
but by 2013, five years after the crash, that share had grown to 58
percent—the year the Democratic U.S. attorney general said that while
he’d wanted to prosecute big banks for their role in the crash, he
didn’t dare because, in addition to their being too big to fail, the
legal trouble might have had 'a negative impact on the national
economy'"</p>

<p>Is there <em>anything</em> that doesn't degrade the battery?</p>
<hr />
<p>"The Silent Killer: How Battery Degradation Can Decrease Your EV's
Resale Value.. Here are several factors that can contribute to battery
degradation.. Prolonged exposition to high temperatures.. Cold
temperatures can also affect the battery's performance.. Fast-charging
too often.. Storing the EV at a wrong state-of-charge: keeping your
car for an extended period with an empty or full battery can harm its
performance and lifespan.. The way in which a car is driven.. Hard
acceleration, high speeds, and frequent braking can all cause the
battery to degrade faster"</p>
<hr />
<p>FleetNews: "Of drivers who said they wouldn’t buy a used EV, 62% cited
concerns around battery lifespan – making the fear of poor battery
health the single largest barrier preventing the second-hand market
from taking off, a concern echoed by industry experts"</p>
<hr />
<p>"@bpaassen@bildung.social</p>
<p>How weird it is that we expect large language models to generalize to
all kinds of tasks... When I say 'generalize' I mean that a model is
able to perform well on new, previously unseen data. In classic
machine learning, this was very strictly defined: We assumed that
training and test data were sampled from exactly the same
distribution.. In recent years, machine learning got more ambitious:
We also tried to make models generalize to test data from <em>other</em>
distributions.. In these scenarios, the theoretical guarantees for
generalization are essentially lost (except for special, nice
cases)... For some reason, we expect LLMs to generalize to entirely
new tasks that the models were not designed for. This is such a wild
and weird expectation. Why would we think that this works?..</p>
<p>I guess because we saw empirical examples [where] it works. But I hope
my long-winded explanation makes clear: We should be
skeptical. Expecting generalization to tasks a system was not designed
for goes far beyond the guarantees we can give.. The reasonable
generalization expectation for LLMs is that they can auto-complete
text in ways that is consistent with the training data and
superficially satisifies human raters that operate under time
pressure. That's what they are trained for. Anything else is
coincidental"</p>

<p><em>End Times</em>: "Ukrainian oligarchs ruled the country unrestrained by
any other internal checks, [but] they did not become a cohesive ruling
class. Instead, they formed several factions that struggled against
each other using as weapons electoral politics, semilegal seizure of
property, and even imprisonment. When Yanukovych came to power in
2010, he jailed his rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, an oligarch popularly
known as the gas princess. The internecine conflicts between the
oligarchs made a mockery of Ukrainian democracy. No matter whom the
Ukrainians elected, the officeholders did nothing for the common
people, instead concentrating on transferring wealth and power from
the losing oligarchs...</p>
<p>By 2014, American 'proconsuls,' such as veteran diplomat Victoria
Nuland, had acquired a large degree of power over the Ukrainian
plutocrats. This was not cheap—Nuland boasted that the Department of
State had invested $5 billion in extending its influence over the
Ukrainian ruling class. In this, the American agents were aided by the
deep animosities pitting the oligarchs against each other and dividing
the oligarchate. Because the oligarchs were unable to agree among
themselves, they required an external manager to set a common
agenda. During the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, as we know from a
transcript of the telephone conversation between them, Nuland and
Geoffrey Pyatt, who was then the US ambassador to Ukraine, made
decisions about who was to be appointed to various state positions
(president, ministers, etc.).</p>
<p>Over the thirty years since Ukraine’s independence, its power
structures have developed as a three-tiered configuration: people,
oligarchs, American proconsuls. The masses of Ukrainian citizens voted
in periodic elections, but whoever they elected pursued their private
interests without any regard for the wishes of the electorate (except
where the popular wishes coincided with the desires of the
oligarchs). As a result, soon after being elected, each administration
rapidly lost public support and became mired in scandal..</p>
<p>The current Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky’s entry into
politics was a result of rivalry between two oligarchs, Poroshenko
(president of Ukraine between 2014 and 2019) and Ihor Kolomoisky (the
head of the Dnipropetrovsk oligarchic clan), who needed a candidate to
oppose Poroshenko"</p>

<p><em>Evil Geniuses</em>: "[In the 2000s] the world’s second-richest man and
most beloved American billionaire—beloved because he’s both low-key
and plainspoken—admitted that those labor leaders in the late 1970s
had been right, that the privileged and powerful had launched a
one-sided war against working people and the middle class. 'There’s
class warfare, all right,' Warren Buffett said, and 'it’s my class,
the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning'—and we
'shouldn’t be.'  Forbes had published its very first list of the
richest people in 1982, estimating Buffett’s wealth then to be the
equivalent today of almost $700 million. Two decades later, when he
talked about the rich waging and winning class war, his fortune had
grown to 58 billion. His fortune is now 85 billion, 130 times what it
was at the beginning of America’s—his phrase—class war"</p>

<p>I cannot see why hybrids have "lower emissions", if you are using ICE
to charge the battery, then you are still emitting GHG while charging
the battery. The savings obtained from regenerative breaking is about
15%, not a game changer. Hybrids, just like battery-electric vehicles
are a waste of time and money. We can have full ZEV using an efficient
fuel that is clean, efficiently produced and stored.</p>
<p>"Hybrid electric vehicles are powered by an internal combustion engine
and one or more electric motors, which uses energy stored in
batteries. A hybrid electric vehicle cannot be plugged in to charge
the battery. Instead, the battery is charged through regenerative
braking and by the internal combustion engine"</p>

United States, attributes the recent rise of U.S. militarism,
especially the invasion of Iraq, to the geopolitical imperatives of
Israel and the concomitant influence of the Zionist lobby. Some of the
proponents of this view go so far as to argue that the U.S. foreign
and/or military policies in the Middle East are made by leading forces
or figures of militant Zionism.. Without denying the contributory
roles of these factors, [my work] points to a more crucial force
behind the drive to war and militarism: the powerful beneficiaries of
military expansion and war dividends, or the military-industrial
complex and related influential interests that are vested in the
business of war and military expansion"</p>
