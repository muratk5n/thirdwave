<p>Deaton, <em>Economics in America</em>: "Wealthy minorities often block public
provision of entitlement-like pensions or of healthcare because they
do not want to pay taxes for them and do not need them for themselves
or their families. Pharma companies lobby for extended patent
protection to keep prices high, and wealthy partners in private equity
firms lobby to preserve the tax breaks for their incomes by labeling
them as capital gains. Banks lobby for rules that allow them to keep
profits but share their losses. The American Medical Association
restricts the number of places in medical schools [.. to] keep
doctorsâ€™ salaries higher than they would be in a competitive
market. Credit card companies are allowed, by the Supreme Court no
less, to prevent retailers from giving discounts to people who pay
cash, so that less well-off people who do not use cards are paying for
the free air tickets and other benefits that credit card companies
provide to their members. States have made it illegal for anyone other
than dealers to sell automobiles, so manufacturers cannot sell
direct. And so on.</p>
<p>If this kind of lobbying and granting of special favors could be
restrictedâ€” and campaign finance reform would helpâ€”inequality would be
reduced, even without changes in taxes"</p>

<p>Andersen: "'When I started in this business,' [Milton] Friedman told
.. [to a conference] attendees [in 1998] 'as a believer in
competition, I was a great supporter of antitrust laws. I thought
enforcing them was one of the few desirable things that the government
could do to promote more competition.' But Friedman said his 'views
about the antitrust laws have changed greatly over time' because, he
claimed, the government had never enforced them aggressively
enough. So disingenuous, and so typical of libertarians who really
donâ€™t believe in competition as much as in disapproving of government
and letting big business have its way"</p>

<p>NYT: "It's a little hard to believe that just over a year ago, a group
of leading researchers asked for a six-month pause in the development
of larger systems of artificial intelligence, fearing that the systems
would become too powerful. 'Should we risk loss of control of our
civilization?' they asked. There was no pause. But now, a year later,
the question isn't really whether A.I. is too smart and will take over
the world. It's whether A.I. is too stupid and unreliable to be
useful. Consider this week's announcement from OpenAI's chief
executive, Sam Altman, who promised he would unveil 'new stuff' that
'feels like magic to me.' But it was just a rather routine
update... Given these constraints, it seems just as likely to me that
generative A.I. could end up like the Roomba, the mediocre vacuum

over the long term. To do this, it is essential to have a clear
understanding of the forms and methods of the use of the application
of force.</p>
<p>These days, together with traditional devices, nonstandard ones are
being developed. The role of mobile, mixed-type groups of forces,
acting in a single intelligence-information space because of the use
of the new possibilities of command-and-control systems has been
strengthened. Military actions are becoming more dynamic, active, and
fruitful. Tactical and operational pauses that the enemy could exploit
are disappearing. New information technologies have enabled
significant reductions in the spatial, temporal, and informational
gaps between forces and control organs. Frontal engagements of large
formations of forces at the strategic and operational level are
gradually becoming a thing of the past. Long-distance, contactless
actions against the enemy are becoming the main means of achieving
combat and operational goals. The defeat of the enemyâ€™s objects is
conducted throughout the entire depth of his territory. The
differences between strategic, operational, and tactical levels, as
well as between offensive and defensive operations, are being
erased. The application of high-precision weaponry is taking on a mass

<p>Hinton, LeCun are two of the three "Godfathers of AI" - the press
keeps conflating one approach in machine learning with all of AI, but
anyway, as far as deep neural nets go, these guys are the top. Perhaps
LeCun more so than the rest.</p>
<hr />
<p>Godfather Fight!</p>
<hr />
<p>LeCun [to Hinton]: "One thing we know is that if future AI systems are
built on the same blueprint as current Auto-Regressive LLMs, they may
become highly knowledgeable but they will still be dumb. They will
still hallucinate, they will still be difficult to control, and they
will still merely regurgitate stuff they've been trained on. MORE
IMPORTANTLY, they will still be unable to reason, unable to invent new
things, or to plan actions to fulfill objectives. And unless they can
be trained from video, they still won't understand the physical
world. Future systems will <em>have</em> to use a different architecture
capable of understanding the world, capable of reasoning, and capable
of planning so as to satisfy a set of objectives and guardrails. These
objective-driven architectures will be safe and will remain under our
control because <em>we</em> set their objectives and guardrails"</p>
<hr />
<p>Geoffrey Hinton: "Companies are planning to train models with 100x
more computation than today's state of the art, within 18 months. No
one knows how powerful they will be. And there's essentially no
regulation on what they'll be able to do with these models"</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Evil Geniuses</em>: "Except for Google, Facebook, and Intel, cable TV and
high-speed Internet providers, and Monsanto in much of
agribusiness.. few of the resulting corporate giants are literal
monopolies, one company absolutely dominating a given sector. Instead,
most major American industries have rapidly turned into oligopolies,
where two or three or four big companies run their show and tend not
to compete fiercely. Itâ€™s like how smart mob families peacefully
coexist.  During the 1990s and 2000s, three-quarters of all
U.S. industries became more concentrated, and their average level of
concentration doubled. Oligopoly is now the American way in mobile and
landline phone service, airlines, credit cards, meat and poultry, beer
and soft drinks, breakfast cereal, and more. In the 1990s the six
biggest banks held only one-sixth of all Americansâ€™ financial assets,
but by 2013, five years after the crash, that share had grown to 58
percentâ€”the year the Democratic U.S. attorney general said that while
heâ€™d wanted to prosecute big banks for their role in the crash, he
didnâ€™t dare because, in addition to their being too big to fail, the
legal trouble might have had 'a negative impact on the national
economy'"</p>

<p>"The Silent Killer: How Battery Degradation Can Decrease Your EV's
Resale Value.. Here are several factors that can contribute to battery
degradation.. Prolonged exposition to high temperatures.. Cold
temperatures can also affect the battery's performance.. Fast-charging
too often.. Storing the EV at a wrong state-of-charge: keeping your
car for an extended period with an empty or full battery can harm its
performance and lifespan.. The way in which a car is driven.. Hard

battery to degrade faster"</p>

<p>"@bpaassen@bildung.social</p>
<p>How weird it is that we expect large language models to generalize to
all kinds of tasks... When I say 'generalize' I mean that a model is
able to perform well on new, previously unseen data. In classic
machine learning, this was very strictly defined: We assumed that
training and test data were sampled from exactly the same
distribution.. In recent years, machine learning got more ambitious:
We also tried to make models generalize to test data from <em>other</em>
distributions.. In these scenarios, the theoretical guarantees for
generalization are essentially lost (except for special, nice
cases)... For some reason, we expect LLMs to generalize to entirely
new tasks that the models were not designed for. This is such a wild
and weird expectation. Why would we think that this works?..</p>
<p>I guess because we saw empirical examples [where] it works. But I hope
my long-winded explanation makes clear: We should be
skeptical. Expecting generalization to tasks a system was not designed
for goes far beyond the guarantees we can give.. The reasonable
generalization expectation for LLMs is that they can auto-complete
text in ways that is consistent with the training data and
superficially satisifies human raters that operate under time
pressure. That's what they are trained for. Anything else is
coincidental"</p>
<hr />
<p><em>End Times</em>: "Ukrainian oligarchs ruled the country unrestrained by
any other internal checks, [but] they did not become a cohesive ruling
class. Instead, they formed several factions that struggled against
each other using as weapons electoral politics, semilegal seizure of
property, and even imprisonment. When Yanukovych came to power in
2010, he jailed his rival, Yulia Tymoshenko, an oligarch popularly
known as the gas princess. The internecine conflicts between the
oligarchs made a mockery of Ukrainian democracy. No matter whom the
Ukrainians elected, the officeholders did nothing for the common
people, instead concentrating on transferring wealth and power from
the losing oligarchs...</p>
<p>By 2014, American 'proconsuls,' such as veteran diplomat Victoria
Nuland, had acquired a large degree of power over the Ukrainian
plutocrats. This was not cheapâ€”Nuland boasted that the Department of
State had invested $5 billion in extending its influence over the
Ukrainian ruling class. In this, the American agents were aided by the
deep animosities pitting the oligarchs against each other and dividing
the oligarchate. Because the oligarchs were unable to agree among
themselves, they required an external manager to set a common
agenda. During the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, as we know from a
transcript of the telephone conversation between them, Nuland and
Geoffrey Pyatt, who was then the US ambassador to Ukraine, made
decisions about who was to be appointed to various state positions
(president, ministers, etc.).</p>
<p>Over the thirty years since Ukraineâ€™s independence, its power
structures have developed as a three-tiered configuration: people,
oligarchs, American proconsuls. The masses of Ukrainian citizens voted
in periodic elections, but whoever they elected pursued their private
interests without any regard for the wishes of the electorate (except
where the popular wishes coincided with the desires of the
oligarchs). As a result, soon after being elected, each administration
rapidly lost public support and became mired in scandal..</p>
<p>The current Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyâ€™s entry into
politics was a result of rivalry between two oligarchs, Poroshenko
(president of Ukraine between 2014 and 2019) and Ihor Kolomoisky (the
head of the Dnipropetrovsk oligarchic clan), who needed a candidate to
oppose Poroshenko"</p>

especially the invasion of Iraq, to the geopolitical imperatives of
Israel and the concomitant influence of the Zionist lobby. Some of the
proponents of this view go so far as to argue that the U.S. foreign
and/or military policies in the Middle East are made by leading forces
or figures of militant Zionism.. Without denying the contributory
roles of these factors, [my work] points to a more crucial force
behind the drive to war and militarism: the powerful beneficiaries of
military expansion and war dividends, or the military-industrial
complex and related influential interests that are vested in the
business of war and military expansion"</p>

<p>"After achieving the first circumnavigations of the globe in a balloon
and more recently in a solar aircraft, Swiss explorer Bertrand Piccard
unveils his new emission-free project: a green hydrogen-powered
airplane to fly non-stop around the Earth, demonstrating how concrete
solutions can help build a cleaner and more efficient world. With
science company Syensqo as the main partner of this technological,
environmental and human adventure, the limits of innovation will be
pushed back to enable the development of the airplane, built in France
by engineer and navigator RaphaÃ«l Dinelli"</p>

<p>Xinhua: "China has successfully developed its first 100-kilogram class
vehicle-mounted liquid hydrogen system, marking a new breakthrough in
the country's transportation sector, according to its developer China
Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). As one of the
core components of liquid hydrogen heavy trucks, the new system is
fully domestically produced and will help hydrogen-powered heavy
trucks achieve an improved range of over 1,000 kilometers with just
one [fueling]"</p>
<hr />
<p>China Daily: "Future rides on hydrogen energy industry.. Sichuan
province is going all out to support the hydrogen energy industry's
development. This follows a conference held in late April on further
promoting the application of the hydrogen industry chain... China's
10,000-ton-level photovoltaic hydrogen production project in Xinjiang
has participated in transactions totaling over 100 million
kilowatt-hours of electricity and is steadily moving toward
full-capacity production. More companies have seen the optimistic
prospects and are actively collaborating to promote industry upgrades.
Buses and heavy trucks are increasingly running on hydrogen, and
Jiaxing Port in East China's Zhejiang province is seeing large-scale
deployment of hydrogen energy heavy trucks"</p>

<p><em>Evil Geniuses</em>: "Even Richard Posner, the pioneering conservative
scholar and senior federal judge.. admitted in 2017 that it has all
gone too far... As a member of Congress, he said, 'you are a slave to
the donors. They own you. Thatâ€™s [the] real corruption, the ownership
of Congress by the rich.' And the Supreme Courtâ€™s Citizens United
decision in 2010, the conservative majorityâ€™s view that 'thereâ€™s no
such thing as spending too much money to support a political
candidate, because your money is actually speechâ€”thatâ€™s all nonsense,'
but as a result, apart from passing a constitutional amendment, 'there
isnâ€™t anything the government can do [about regulating campaign
finance] now'"</p>

<p>Bad: it's an absolute capitalistic hellscape of an offer, starting at
5,000 â‚¬ / year and going up to 90,000 â‚¬/y. Good riddance, Open Data.</p>
<p>I am aware that the root of the problem is likely a combination of

<p>I wasn't picking on Neil Foei Gras Tyson; he is trained scientist, had
some good takes on private vs public finance of space exploration back
when... I can't say guy is any more or less annoying than the current
crop of science popularizers out there, many of whom keep pulling
unverified theories out of their asses, multiverses, string theory, to
name a few... I only stated Tyson's claim to fame was based on a
falsehood, but then again, which science character is completely
deserving of the limelight they have? What did Brian Greene achieve?
Sean Carroll? The theories they blurt out remain unproven, in
Carroll's case cannot <em>be</em> proven. It's all bunch of scifi-friendly
non-falsifiable non-sense. Quite unscientific if you ask me.</p>
