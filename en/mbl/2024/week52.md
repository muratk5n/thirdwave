A shockingly large portion of the world‚Äôs current problems trace back
to an excess of investment money desperate for more things to invest
in"

---

Quora: "The [human brain, neural net ("AI")] comparison is ridiculous
but fun to do. We have no real idea what brain neurons firing really
does. There's lots going on in all its connections. There's no reason
to conclude that they communicate only binary information. And then
there are all the other cells in the brain that aren't neurons. We
don't know what they do either.

This analogy is also wrong in other ways. The brain's connections are
highly organized. It's far more complicated than the layers in an
artificial neural network"

---

Scaling existing approaches 1000-fold would mean power requirements
becoming ginarmous. People talk about "AI" needing electricity
equaling the demand of a small country today. What kind of power req
would be thousand times that? Clearly nothing that can be supplied in
a sustainable manner. A new approach is called for. Lots of phenomena
is formulated via mathematics.. Where is the mathematics of thought
(math used for NN *implementation* does not count).

---

And there is the problem of textual data not being enough for
intelligence, see Yann LeCun (reportedly he is working on this
problem), different types of data and more of it will be needed for
human-like intelligence.

---

Based on these numbers current "AI" is at the level of a hamster. A
hamster is performing LLM for you, so we should not be surprised when
it spits out complete garbage as it frequently does such as when it
says in Roman architecture before the use of windows there was
MS-DOS. Or w/ MS copilot code generation whose debugging costs more
time then it saves.

Let's also not forget the neural net approach might be architecturally
deficient from get-go, no matter the scale, it will not achieve AGI
(though it can be part of a larger solution doing its little isolated
black box thing).  We do not mimic nature one-to-one. Planes do not
fly like birds.  Mathematically formulating any physical phenomena has
almost no relation to the way nature computes that phenomena (God does
not use, or need differential equations).

Quora: "[Neural network] parameters are more analogous to synapses
(connections) than neurons (the nodes in between connections)
somewhere in the range of 100-160 billion is the current upper number
for specialized networks.

Deriving the number of neurons in AI systems from this number is a
stretch since these AIs emulate certain types of connections and sub
assemblies of neurons, but let's continue...

So now let's look at the brain, and again this are all contested
numbers. Number of neurons ~ 86 Billion, Number of Synapses ~ 150
Trillion, another generalization: average number of synapses per
neuron ~ 1,744.

So now we have something to compare, and I can't stress this enough,
these are all wonky numbers, so let's make our life a little easier
and divide :

Number of Synapses (Brain ) : 150 trillion / Number of parameters AIs:
150 billion = 1,000 or in other words current AIs would have to
scale by a factor of one thousand their connections to be on par with
the brain"

---

One neuron in human brain is connected (via "synapses") to 1000+ other
neurons.. Massive number. The "number of parameters" usually quoted
for neural networks (eg LLMs) are equivalent to synapses in human
brain.

Governance descending from militocracies are not necessarily run like
militaries today... The *evolution* of such cultures eventually led to
bureucratic governance structures of a certain type of an elite that
had its roots in military rule. Such evolution proved more durable,
more useful than other kinds. A king would want order, a strong army,
want to keep its existing land, which could lead to wanting to have a
healthy, educated, industrious population, rather than Anglo cultures
who descend from merchantile parasitic money grubbers merely seeing
their country, overseas territories as places to be exploited, "traded
with" and that sometimes could mean destruction of local artisans,
local rules, as well as enslavement of countries at large. Plutocratic
culture did not evolve into something healthy and durable as we
clearly see in US and UK now. Both countries are legit basket cases.

Gizmodo: "I‚Äôm Tired of Pretending Physical Media Isn‚Äôt Still Better
Than Streaming Digital.. I was assigned to watch Furiosa at LA‚Äôs
glorious IMAX Headquarters. In order to prep, I thought I‚Äôd just turn
on Max and re-watch *Mad Max: Fury Road*. And to my surprise and quick
consternation, what was discovered within a few minutes of watching
the film is that something was off with the score‚Äôs audio. My husband
and I have long been appointment movie theater goers‚Äîwe‚Äôre there at
the first or second opening-day showtime‚Äîand we remember how *Mad Max:
Fury Road* sounded. This was not it. Figuring that something must have
gone wrong with Max‚Äôs streaming service compression of the audio
files, we switched over to our digital copy. And still it didn‚Äôt sound
quite right. So we dug out our Blu-ray and popped it in, and there it
was: the pristine sounds of Junkie XL‚Äôs warring drums and guitars
coming out of our soundbar"

Futurism: "Back in the day, you could ask the red-hot AI system to
whip up instructions on everything from shoplifting to committing
murder. But that's changed as its creators have enacted more and more

moderators... But as geniuses online have figured out, there's a
brilliant 'jailbreak' that unlocks a much naughtier side of the

H2 Fuel News: Launched in January 2021, the FCH2RAIL project had a
budget exceeding ‚Ç¨14 million, over 70% of which was funded by European
Union programs. The consortium included Renfe, CAF, Toyota Motor
Europe, and CNH2, among others, all working to develop a prototype
train equipped with a Fuel Cell Hybrid PowerPack (FCHPP)... Designed
to operate seamlessly on both electrified and non-electrified tracks,
the prototype achieved over 10,000 kilometers of testing across varied
routes. This included challenging journeys in the Aragonese Pyrenees
and cross-border trials in Portugal, signaling the adaptability and
robustness of hydrogen technology.

Bytes Europe: "Australia And South Korea Strengthen Hydrogen And
Carbon Capture Partnership.. Australia and South Korea have formalized
a new bilateral agreement to bolster climate and energy collaboration,
paving the way for expanded clean energy industries and trade
opportunities.

Signed on December 20th, the Green Economy Partnership Arrangement
(Green EPA) aims to diversify clean energy supply chains, enhance
hydrogen systems, and advance carbon capture, utilization, and storage
(CCUS). This agreement will also streamline trade barriers and foster
cooperation on carbon market standards and certifications"

The Guardian: "‚ÄòFastest-growing fire risk‚Äô: why do lithium batteries
keep exploding across Australia?.. Fire and Rescue NSW responded to
272 battery-related fires last year, while Victoria and Queensland
authorities say they happen almost every day...

Fire and Rescue NSW has referred to lithium-ion batteries as the
‚Äúfastest-growing fire risk‚Äù in the state. The agency responded to 272
battery-related fires last year ‚Äì more than five each week...

If a lithium-ion battery is charged too fast, it can result in thermal
runaway ‚Äì an uncontrollable increase in temperature. ‚ÄúThe electrolyte
heats up, because there‚Äôs too much energy in the battery,‚Äù Ellis
says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in a pressurised system, and so then all of a sudden ‚Äì
bang ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll crack.‚Äù The liquid electrolyte is highly flammable and
will burst into flames when exposed to air...

Overheating and physical damage are the main causes of battery
failure.

Lithium-ion battery fires can reach high temperatures within seconds
and release highly toxic gases. Because of their chemical components,
burning batteries can develop self-sustaining flames that are
difficult to extinguish"

Chomsky: "[2015] America is a plutocracy masquerading as a
democracy.. Democrats now are mostly what used to be called ‚Äòmoderate
Republicans.‚Äô There‚Äôs ample evidence that most of the population, at
the lower end of the income spectrum, is effectively disenfranchised ‚Äì
their representatives pay no attention to their opinions. Moving up
the income ladder, influence increases slowly, but it‚Äôs only at the
very top that it has real impact"

Politico: "New research shows the massive hole Dems are in.. Even
voters who previously backed Democrats cast the party as weak and
overly focused on diversity and elites..

When asked to compare the Democratic Party to an animal, one
participant compared the party to an ostrich because 'they‚Äôve got
their heads in the sand and are absolutely committed to their own
ideas, even when they‚Äôre failing.' Another likened them to koalas, who
'are complacent and lazy about getting policy wins that we really
need.' Democrats, another said, are 'not a friend of the working class
anymore'"

Ed Zitron: "In the last year, I‚Äôve spent about 200,000 words on a kind
of personal journey where I‚Äôve tried again and again to work out
why everything digital feels so broken, and why it seems to keep
getting worse, despite what tech‚Äôs 'brightest' minds might
promise. More regularly than not, I‚Äôve found that the answer is fairly
simple: the tech industry‚Äôs incentives no longer align with the user. 

The people running the majority of internet services have used a
combination of monopolies and a cartel-like commitment to
growth-at-all-costs thinking to make war with the user, turning the
customer into something between a lab rat and an unpaid intern, with
the goal to juice as much value from the interaction as possible. To
be clear, tech has always had an avaricious streak, and it would be
naive to suggest otherwise, but this moment feels different. I‚Äôm
stunned by the extremes tech companies are going to extract value from
customers, but also by the insidious way they‚Äôve gradually degraded
their products...

As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from
every user, everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through
plugins, advertising, microtransactions and other things that
constantly gnaw at the user experience. We load websites expecting
them to be broken, especially on mobile, because every single website
has to have 15+ different ad trackers, video ads that cover large
chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email or for us to let
them send us notifications...

Your work software veers between 'shit' and 'just okay,' and never
really seems to get better, nor does any part seem to smoothly connect
to another. Your organization juggles anywhere from five to fifteen
different pieces of software ‚Äî Slack or Microsoft Teams and/or Zoom
for communication, Asana or Monday or Basecamp for project management,
or Jira, or Trello, or any number of other different ways that your
organization or team wants to plan things. When you connect with
another organization, you find they‚Äôre using a different product, or
perhaps they‚Äôre using the same one ‚Äî say, Slack ‚Äî and that one
requires you to join their organization, which may or may not work"

If Iran / Russia were not happy with Assad but Israel was, both
countries could prefer a new regime given they received certain
guarantees. In that case the toppling of Assad becomes an RU/TR/IR
operation. How Syria shapes up after Assad will give clues which side
pulled off this feat.

The New Arab: "A series of reportedly leaked documents found following
Bashar al-Assad's regime collapse have revealed a covert channel of
communication between Syria and Israel. Although the papers have not
been independently verified, they bear the official Syrian Arab
Republic letterheads and intelligence branch stamps.

Photographs of the alleged documents were shared widely online by
several journalists in Syria and pan-Arab Arabic language media
outlets. The contents of the reported documents challenge the
long-standing narrative that the Assad government was a steadfast
opponent of Israel, instead portraying its alleged complicity in
Israeli military operations against Iranian targets"

Oliver Stone, *The Untold History of US*: "Roosevelt kept up his harsh
attack on business throughout the 1936 campaign. He trumpeted the list
of progressive achievements. The Works Progress Administration (WPA)
and other government programs put millions of unemployed back to work
in government jobs. The economic and banking systems had been
reformed. The government, for the first time, sided, however
tentatively, with labor against the employers and nurtured the growth
of unions. Social Security guaranteed a modicum of comfort in old age
that few workers had previously enjoyed. The tax burden was shifted
increasingly to the wealthy.

On the eve of the election, Roosevelt took his defiantly antibusiness
message to supporters at Madison Square Garden, declaring,

'We had to struggle with the old enemies of peace‚Äîbusiness and
financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking class antagonism,
sectionalism, war profiteering. They had begun to consider the
Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own
affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as
dangerous as Government by organized mob ‚Ä¶ They are unanimous in their
hate for me‚Äîand I welcome their hatred.'

When election day came around, the revitalized Democrats gave the
Republicans the political thrashing of their lives at every level.

And the London mayor was knighted all of a sudden.. Is he being primed
to take the job after Starm, so now the challenger will have a
balancing title, the two can knight off?

---

Byline Times: "The Prime Minister's acceptance of right-wing economic
orthodoxy is pushing his party and the country towards disaster,
argues his former adviser Simon Fletcher..

For Ipsos, latest research¬†has just 27% of the public satisfied with
Starmer's performance, with 61% dissatisfied. Public satisfaction with
the Government is also low, with a net satisfaction rating of -49...

Perhaps inevitably, but certainly very early on in the parliament,
there is now speculation that Labour's poor performance may mean that
Starmer will not survive as Labour leader and Prime Minister into the
next election"

The Guardian: "[2013] In a cruel twist of fate, I fear that the
movement for women's liberation has become entangled in a dangerous
liaison with neoliberal efforts to build a free-market society. That
would explain how it came to pass that feminist ideas that once formed
part of a radical worldview are increasingly expressed in
individualist terms. Where feminists once criticised a society that
promoted careerism, they now advise women to "lean in". A movement
that once prioritised social solidarity now celebrates female
entrepreneurs. A perspective that once valorised "care" and
interdependence now encourages individual advancement and meritocracy.

What lies behind this shift is a sea-change in the character of
capitalism. The state-managed capitalism of the postwar era has given
way to a new form of capitalism - 'disorganised', globalising,
neoliberal. Second-wave feminism¬†emerged as a critique of the first
but has become the handmaiden of the second"

"@GeofCox@climatejustice.social

My perspective from France includes reservations about both the UK's
'metro mayors' model and unitary authorities. Although such things
exist in France (eg. Paris. which is both a commune and a department),
the backbone of French democracy is the small commune with its elected
mayor.  The commune I live in has only just over a thousand residents.

Mayors are powerful, and local people have real access to them.  When
we moved here, we went to see the mayor (which is the norm here) and
he personally guided us round the village school (we moved with an
8-year-old).  When we had a problem with the village road outside our
house, we went to see the mayor and a few days later the local team
came a put in new drainage - and that afternoon the mayor himself came
round and asked if that had all gone ok.

You see how different - how much more local and friendly and
responsive - this is, compared with the UK ?  Shouldn't you be
devolving power down to much smaller areas/populations, rather than up
to metro mayors and unitary authorities?"

There was major animosity between RFK and LBJ, Robert K never agreed
Johnson's pick as VP, while in office, heading DOJ, he even started an
investigation on Johnson. Needless to say as President, Johnson was
saved from any such probes into his past (which was murky to say the
least).

LBJ escalated the war in Vietnam and profited handsomely from it, he
had investments in multiple weapon manufacturing firms. He left office

Tim Fleming: "Mac Wallace, a convicted killer and a close associate of
LBJ, had his fingerprints lifted from one of the boxes near the
sniper‚Äôs nest in the Texas School Book Depository building. Wallace
has long been suspected of being LBJ‚Äôs own personal hit man. Evidence
of this comes from Billy Sol Estes, LBJ‚Äôs long-time bagman and bribe
collector. Estes‚Äô attorney wrote the following letter to the Justice
Department in 1984:

'.. Dear Mr. Trott:

My client, Mr. Estes, has authorized me to make this reply to your
letter of May 29, 1984. Mr. Estes was a member of a four-member group,
headed by Lyndon Johnson, which committed criminal acts in Texas in
the 1960's. The other two, besides Mr. Estes and LBJ, were Cliff
Carter and Mac Wallace. Mr. Estes is willing to disclose his knowledge
concerning the following criminal offenses:

Murders

1. The killing of Henry Marshall
2. The killing of George Krutilek
3. The killing of Ike Rogers and his secretary
4. The killing of Harold Orr
5. The killing of Coleman Wade
6. The killing of Josefa Johnson
7. The killing of John Kinser
8. The killing of President J. F. Kennedy.

Mr. Estes is willing to testify that LBJ ordered these killings, and
that he transmitted his orders through Cliff Carter to Mac Wallace,
who executed the murders'"
