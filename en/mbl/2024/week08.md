# Week 8


In a blockade scenario Kinmen would be blocked off along with Taiwan.
It is even closer to CH mainland than Taiwan so it can be attacked
short-range weapons, and any deployment there would not last IMO
without continuous supplies.

Too close for comfort. But does the deployment make strategic sense?
Or is it another one of those McDonalds-like franchise US military
deployments? "We're here bro (give us money)". "Would you like fries to
go with that HIMARS?"

Kinmen eh?

Newsweek: "[02/08] US Army Special Forces Train Taiwan Troops Near
China's Coast.. The instructors were sent to the Penghu or Pescadores
islands closer to Taiwan proper, but also to Kinmen, a group of
islands visible from the port city of Xiamen in eastern China"

Frontline 02/10 - 02/17 - Avdiivka has fallen. RU gains near Chasiv
Yar, Novovodiane, Synkivka.
