<p>Nikkei Asia: "Japan and the European Union will work together on
setting international standards for the hydrogen supply chain, in a
bid to take the lead in shaping a new market, Nikkei has learned. The
rules would cover such areas as technologies for producing and
transporting the fuel.</p>
<p>Japan's minister for economy, trade and industry, Ken Saito, and Kadri
Simson, the European commissioner for energy, will agree in an
upcoming meeting to create a joint road map for hydrogen usage through
2040"</p>
<hr />
<p>SCMP: "Start-up CM Xiageng Hydrogen Energy Technology, a green
hydrogen equipment maker backed by the Fujian government and
conglomerate China Merchants Group, plans to quadruple its output. It
is rushing to feed a global market which is growing at a searing pace
of 40.7 per cent annually.. It will soon launch fund raising plans to
finance this expansion at a time when China’s installed green hydrogen
electrolyser capacity is expected to grow to over 40GW by 2025 from
last year’s 11.5GW"</p>
<hr />
<p>The Atlantic: "AI travel plans leave something to be desired. When I
told ChatGPT that I was a 'huge foodie' and asked it to adjust an
L.A. itinerary accordingly, it suggested I go to a Michelin-starred
restaurant for dinner. It didn’t say which one. It just told me that
L.A. had some and that, if I liked food, I should go to one. That’s
sort of like telling a person who likes music that maybe they’d be
into a Grammy-winning artist and leaving it at that...</p>
<p>[A] team of researchers at Fudan University in Shanghai, Ohio State
University, Penn State, and Meta came to a similar conclusion. They
tested chatbots on 1,000 sample queries, such as 'Please create a
travel itinerary for a solo traveler departing from Jacksonville and
heading to Los Angeles for a period of 3 days, from March 25th to
March 27th, 2022. The budget for this trip is now set at $2,400.' They
then evaluated whether the chatbots were able to provide answers that
met all the criteria in the prompt. The chatbots pretty much failed
across the board. [Even the best] successfully answered only six
queries out of 1,000, or 0.6 percent. The chatbots failed for a
variety of factors: They made reasoning errors, and sometimes made
stuff up"</p>

<p>NPU means Neural Processing Unit, so the machine runs "AI" locally,
wout going out to the cloud. But I dont think one dinky little
"neural" processing unit will allow you to run any of these recent
LLMs locally. It is unclear such an ability would be desired
either. LLMs are useless for any serious real-world need.</p>

Laptop 6 feature an NPU"</p>

it will take 10-30x more resources.</p>

fully loaded into vram to compute the recursive seq2seq response (it
can be anything between 30gb to 200gb depending on the architecture

<p>Stanford: "Vaporware: One practice that has been associated with
Microsoft, and has subsequently been investigated by the Department of
Justice, is Microsoft's practice of releasing 'vaporware'. Vaporware
is considered an unfair marketing technique - it often allows a
company that already has considerable market share in one area to
claim similar market share in another area without even distributing a
product. The enthusiasm for the anticipated release of the product is
often enough to squelch any market competition, even though there is
no product to compete"</p>

master at it back in the day.</p>

<p>In a historic first for Europe, green hydrogen producer Lhyfe has
signed a memorandum of understanding with major stainless steel
company Ugitech to create a green hydrogen production facility at
Ugitech's plant in the French Alps.</p>
<p>This pioneering partnership aims to replace dirty pollution with clean
hydrogen in steel manufacturing, according to Renewable Energy
Magazine.</p>
<p><img width='340' src='https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-276.jpg?w=340'/> </p>
<p>Under the agreement, Lhyfe will install a green hydrogen production
unit capable of generating around 13 tons per day at Ugitech's site in
Ugine, France. The locally produced hydrogen will power the steel
plant's furnaces and heating equipment, with excess supply made
available to fuel clean transportation in the region.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley, Big Tech creates fluff, bullshit products, vapourware
all the time. But the big daddy of them all is still the MIC. They've
been at this for over half a century. They are good at it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The private, revolving-door military-industrial-donor-complex has it
wired so good, sometimes they don't even have to deliver a functioning
product to make money.. A promise, a mere dream of a product will
do. See the example of XM2001 Crusader mobile cannon, project greenlit
in 1995 (Clinton admin), canceled after $7 billion, they delivered
nothing. Zilch. The military leaders pushing such systems are
promoted, not punished, and likely moved on to cushy private sector
jobs. The corporate press saw none of this as they were heavily
focused on more pressing issues such as "gays in the military".</p>

<p>There is no strategy.. it's bunch of money grubbing muckmuckers trying
to maximize their short-term gain at the expense of strategy, as in,
what is good for the citizens, country in the long term.</p>
<hr />
<p>Israel is needed for the private complex; their very presence is the
instigator of chaos, and chaos = profits. The shit stirred up in Syria
alone (an Israel enemy) was a massive moneymaker for the MIC, and it's
not just about weapons sent to Israel. Israel can sell US military
equipment, with US' knowledge, to countries to which the U.S. is
restricted by law from selling, they act as the middleman. A vast
military deployment is possible / is justified by Israel's presence
and US' "protection" of it. </p>
<hr />
<p>Just like Israel is not 'the tail wagging the dog' when it comes to US
foreign policy, Russiagate was not completely abt helping Dems save
face for their disastrous 2016 loss either. Russiagate was a suitable
line of attack precisely bcz it forced the Trump admin to be colder
towards Russia. With all the "Putin puppet" talk going on the new
admin had to act hawkish against them, and this was RG's key
feature. As far as the military-industrial-complex, revolving-door
private-owned surface-state is concerned, if Russia cannot be
plundered by American oligarchs, they have to be villified, so NATO is
always front in center in the relation and MIC can sell weapons within
its specs. Russiagate performed this function brilliantly as well as
checking other boxes, blaming a foreign power so econ ineq is not
discussed, attempting to salvage the Clinton legacy (who is the prime
shitlib, econ-right social-left extraordinaire, fake left, poser, and
a dumbass).</p>
