<h1>Week 23</h1>
<p>In a historic first for Europe, green hydrogen producer Lhyfe has
signed a memorandum of understanding with major stainless steel
company Ugitech to create a green hydrogen production facility at
Ugitech's plant in the French Alps.</p>
<p>This pioneering partnership aims to replace dirty pollution with clean
hydrogen in steel manufacturing, according to Renewable Energy
Magazine.</p>
<p><img width='340' src='https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-276.jpg?w=340'/> </p>
<p>Under the agreement, Lhyfe will install a green hydrogen production
unit capable of generating around 13 tons per day at Ugitech's site in
Ugine, France. The locally produced hydrogen will power the steel
plant's furnaces and heating equipment, with excess supply made
available to fuel clean transportation in the region.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley, Big Tech creates fluff, bullshit products, vapourware
all the time. But the big daddy of them all is still the MIC. They've
been at this for over half a century. They are good at it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The private, revolving-door military-industrial-donor-complex has it
wired so good, sometimes they don't even have to deliver a functioning
product to make money.. A promise, a mere dream of a product will
do. See the example of XM2001 Crusader mobile cannon, project greenlit
in 1995 (Clinton admin), canceled after $7 billion, they delivered
nothing. Zilch. The military leaders pushing such systems are
promoted, not punished, and likely moved on to cushy private sector
jobs. The corporate press saw none of this as they were heavily
focused on more pressing issues such as "gays in the military".</p>

<p>There is no strategy.. it's bunch of money grubbing muckmuckers trying
to maximize their short-term gain at the expense of strategy, as in,
what is good for the citizens, country in the long term.</p>
<hr />
<p>Israel is needed for the private complex; their very presence is the
instigator of chaos, and chaos = profits. The shit stirred up in Syria
alone (an Israel enemy) was a massive moneymaker for the MIC, and it's
not just about weapons sent to Israel. Israel can sell US military
equipment, with US' knowledge, to countries to which the U.S. is
restricted by law from selling, they act as the middleman. A vast
military deployment is possible / is justified by Israel's presence
and US' "protection" of it. </p>
<hr />
<p>Just like Israel is not 'the tail wagging the dog' when it comes to US
foreign policy, Russiagate was not completely abt helping Dems save
face for their disastrous 2016 loss either. Russiagate was a suitable
line of attack precisely bcz it forced the Trump admin to be colder
towards Russia. With all the "Putin puppet" talk going on the new
admin had to act hawkish against them, and this was RG's key
feature. As far as the military-industrial-complex, revolving-door
private-owned surface-state is concerned, if Russia cannot be
plundered by American oligarchs, they have to be villified, so NATO is
always front in center in the relation and MIC can sell weapons within
its specs. Russiagate performed this function brilliantly as well as
checking other boxes, blaming a foreign power so econ ineq is not
discussed, attempting to salvage the Clinton legacy (who is the prime
shitlib, econ-right social-left extraordinaire, fake left, poser, and
a dumbass).</p>
