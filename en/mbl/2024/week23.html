<p>Green Car Congress: "Hanwha Aerospace and Hanwha Ocean.. will jointly
develop hydrogen fuel cells for ships as part of a government-led
green energy project"</p>
<hr />
<p>Popular Mechanics: "In the quest for vehicle fuel sources, Korea has
taken the lead on crafting a combustion engine that runs on
hydrogen. But it isn’t just Korea’s Kia and Hyundai — which have
teamed to create a hydrogen combustion engine—moving forward on the
concept. Volvo is now also planning on the design.</p>

<p>The technology is virtually already in place for hydrogen combustion
engines, and both the driving ranges and refilling times are similar
to that of traditional gasoline-powered combustion engines"</p>

<p>Here’s a video of two MSFT employees gaining access to the Recall
database folder - with SQLite database right there. Watch their
hacking skills. (You don’t need to go this length as an attacker,
either). Cc @riskybusiness@infosec.exchange. I’m not being hyperbolic
when I say this is the dumbest cybersecurity move in a decade. Good
luck to my parents safely using their PC"</p>

<p>There is no strategy.. it's bunch of money grubbing muckmuckers trying
to maximize their short-term gain at the expense of strategy, as in,
what is good for the citizens, country in the long term.</p>
<hr />
<p>Israel is needed for the private complex; their very presence is the
instigator of chaos, and chaos = profits. The shit stirred up in Syria
alone (an Israel enemy) was a massive moneymaker for the MIC, and it's
not just about weapons sent to Israel. Israel can sell US military
equipment, with US' knowledge, to countries to which the U.S. is
restricted by law from selling, they act as the middleman. A vast
military deployment is possible / is justified by Israel's presence
and US' "protection" of it. </p>
<hr />
<p>Just like Israel is not 'the tail wagging the dog' when it comes to US
foreign policy, Russiagate was not completely abt helping Dems save
face for their disastrous 2016 loss either. Russiagate was a suitable
line of attack precisely bcz it forced the Trump admin to be colder
towards Russia. With all the "Putin puppet" talk going on the new
admin had to act hawkish against them, and this was RG's key
feature. As far as the military-industrial-complex, revolving-door
private-owned surface-state is concerned, if Russia cannot be
plundered by American oligarchs, they have to be villified, so NATO is
always front in center in the relation and MIC can sell weapons within
its specs. Russiagate performed this function brilliantly as well as
checking other boxes, blaming a foreign power so econ ineq is not
discussed, attempting to salvage the Clinton legacy (who is the prime
shitlib, econ-right social-left extraordinaire, fake left, poser, and
a dumbass).</p>

<p>WaPo: "Russian jamming leaves some high-tech U.S. weapons ineffective
in Ukraine..  Confidential Ukrainian assessments obtained by The
Washington Post show how accuracy rates of some Western weapons fell
after Russian jamming disrupted guidance systems.</p>
<hr />
<p>JDAM-ER, Storm Shadow, Scalp are all jammed. Himars hit rate is now
between 50-70%, Excalibur an embarrassing 6%. Up and down links of the
UA drones are also jammed #AustriaMil</p>

Biden"</p>
