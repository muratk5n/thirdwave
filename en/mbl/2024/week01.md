NewScientist: "NFTs died a slow, painful death in 2023 as most are now
worthless"

Vox: "To explain leveraged buyouts in easier-to-understand terms,
let‚Äôs say you buy a house. Under normal circumstances, if you can‚Äôt
pay for the mortgage, you would be in trouble. But by the LBO rules,
you‚Äôre only responsible for a portion. If you pay for 30 percent of
the house, the other 70 percent of the asking price is debt placed on
the house. The house owes that money to the bank or creditor who lent
it, not you. Of course, a house can‚Äôt owe money. But under the private
equity model, it does, and its assets ‚Äî its factories, stores,
equipment, etc. ‚Äî are collateral.

The idea, in theory, behind private equity is that the endeavor will
be worth it ‚Äî for both you and the house. 'There are many companies
that, if not for private equity, would not be able to get access to
the kind of capital they need to scale, to transform, to turn around,
and to have succession planning,' said one industry source, who
requested anonymity to speak candidly for this story.

But because of the debt companies end up owing creditors as part of a
deal, they sometimes find themselves with such high interest payments
that they can‚Äôt make the investments necessary to be competitive or
even stay afloat. Plus, companies often take out additional loans to
pay private equity investors dividends, and then they pay a fee if and
when they are sold. If they can‚Äôt pay off the debt, the companies are
on the hook, and their employees and customers are the ones to suffer
the consequences.

And private equity‚Äôs No. 1 priority isn‚Äôt the long-term health of the
companies it buys ‚Äî it‚Äôs to make money, and as is the case in so many
facets of investing today, to make money fast.

'Some of the larger private equity firms, they‚Äôre not retaining
investments in the long-term. They are designed to produce short-term
returns, and if there is nothing left of the company at the end,
that‚Äôs okay,' said Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) in an interview.

Corporate power built the ICSID system to avoid having to entice their
lapdog politicians to invade countries left and right for them. This
shady arbitration system is active, ready-for-use 24/7, every day of
the year. Corps can always drag a country to court for minor
disgressions, even the threat of it can make countries roll over and
roll out the red carpet for you. No need for colonization in this day
and age. The post-colonial system is more insidious and underhanded.

Operation Targeting Anti-Zionist Students and Professors.. Americans
who give money to Canary Mission are potentially committing a serious
crime by acting as agents of a foreign power.. Canary Mission [is] a
massive blacklisting and doxxing operation directed from Israel that
targets students and professors critical of Israeli policies, and then
launches slanderous charges against them‚Äîcharges designed to embarrass
and humiliate them and damage their future employability"

"The Web is Fantastic.. The real web is built on links. Hyper ones, in
fact. Links you can share on your website. Links you can send to your
mates. Links to pages that can be indexed by search engines so you can
find things again..

The big social media sites have decided that actually no, we don't
like links. Just sort of "find" things and if you don't find it well
tough shit. Sharing interesting websites, blogs, and articles on your
own site is the way to go. Make a blogroll. Make a podroll. Share
links on your Mastodon account...

Blogs and RSS never died. Some of us just took a little break from it
while we all shitposted on Twitter for likes, retweets, and
validation. While we wrote long, unfindable threads instead of blog
posts. I'm as guilty of this as anyone"

NYT: "[C]ritics both within Israel and outside have questioned whether
resolving to destroy such a deeply entrenched organization [as Hamas]
was ever realistic. One former Israeli national security adviser
called the plan 'vague'. 'I think that we have reached a moment when
the Israeli authorities will have to define more clearly what their
final objective is,' President Emmanuel Macron of France said this
month. 'The total destruction of Hamas? Does anybody think that‚Äôs
possible? If it‚Äôs that, the war will last 10 years.' Since it first
emerged in 1987, Hamas has survived repeated attempts to eliminate its
leadership. The organization‚Äôs very structure was designed to absorb
such contingencies, according to political and military
specialists. In addition, Israel‚Äôs devastating tactics in the Gaza war
threaten to radicalize a broader segment of the population, inspiring
new recruits"

Andersen: "As antitrust enforcement was discredited and enfeebled
starting in the 1970s, big corporations were able to get so big and
dominant in their business or regions that they had ever fewer
companies directly competing with them to hire workers. More and more
of them became the only games in town. One of the scholars who has
helped expose this particular bit of rigging and its unfairness over
the last several decades is the influential, idiosyncratic University
of Chicago law professor Eric Posner. As he and his economist
co-author Glen Weyl explain, antitrust laws were enacted to make sure
that businesses compete in every way‚Äînot just as sellers setting the
prices they charge for products and services, but also as buyers of
labor setting the salaries they pay.

The appeal of antitrust for citizens was to make sure competition kept
prices lower and salaries higher. Enforcement of our antitrust laws,
however, has come to focus entirely on consumer prices, particularly
since the definitive Borking of the field in the late 1970s. The
antitrust enforcers at the Department of Justice and Federal Trade
Commission, because they rely 'on the traditional assumption that
labor markets are competitive,' and that it wasn‚Äôt their jobs to
protect workers anyhow, 'have never blocked a merger because of its
effect on labor,' and they don‚Äôt even employ experts who could
calculate those effects"

TDB: "I Served in the IDF in the 2014 War in Gaza. The Friends I Lost
There Should Have Been the Last Ones. Almost every old friend I run
into talks to me about Gaza. Most of them are in therapy to help them
let go of what they experienced there‚Äîmost of them unsuccessfully. We
are the soldiers who served the Israeli concept of 'managing the
conflict' and the endless rounds-of-fighting policy"
