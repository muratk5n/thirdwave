<p>The Age: "Green energy pioneer Andrew Forrest’s Fortescue says it is
on track to produce its target of 50 million tons of hydrogen by 2030
after converting and gaining world-first certification for a ship
running on a mix of green ammonia and diesel"</p>

<p>"Plug Continues to Make Substantial Advancement in Hydrogen Generation
Buildout...  Plug Power Inc... a global leader in comprehensive
hydrogen solutions for the green hydrogen economy, has reached
nameplate capacity at the company’s hydrogen plants in Georgia and
Tennessee. With this increased supply from our hydrogen production
network, Plug will benefit from a lower cost of hydrogen, a crucial
step in the company’s roadmap to achieve profitable growth. This is
headlined by the company’s first green hydrogen plant in Georgia
already reaching nameplate capacity of 15 tons per day (TPD) of liquid
hydrogen production"</p>

Florida will save him at least $610 million"</p>
<hr />
<p>Basically they compute the Hubble constant two different ways, and
they came out different. One method relies on cosmic microwave
background from the so-called "Big Bang" the other from measuring
velocities and distances of galaxies. They thought the latter could
have been wrong (due to an older telescope) and hoped JWST would give
a results closer to the CMB one (which would rescue early universe
theories) that did not pan out. JWST confirmed the "tension", a fancy
word indicating cosmologist don't know what the f--k is going on
anymore. The CMB route includes a formula with "dark energy"
$\Lambda$, whose existence is in question. CMB's existence should be
too, along with Big Bang. The situation is pretty sad. Fundamental sci
is failing.</p>
<hr />
<p>Paper: "Over the last decade an intriguing tension has emerged between
the value of the Hubble constant (H0) measured directly from redshifts
and distances, following its local definition and independent of
models, and the same parameter inferred from the cosmological model,
calibrated in the early Universe.. The James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) provides new capabilities to scrutinize and refine some of the
strongest observational evidence for this tension"</p>

<p>Said: "For the Israelis, there’s always this tendency to think of us
as aliens and therefore the fewer of us around the better, and the
best are those you don’t see at all….What’s so extraordinary is that
what the Israelis are now doing on the West Bank and Gaza is really
repeating the experience of apartheid and what the United States did
to the Native Americans. Put them in reservations or just exterminate
them, which the Israelis haven’t done, but put them as far aways as
possible, then the problem will go away.”</p>
<hr />
<p>What a concidence, the school where Said taught becomes the center of
Gaza protest attention. Said, as many know, was originally
Palestinian, wrote many famous books on the subject and is also the
coiner / popularizer of the word Orientalism (published a book with
the same name). Isn't the way Israel dehumanizes, looks down on
Palestinians and describes them as such to foreign media a textbook
case of Orientalism? </p>
<hr />
<p>Columbia University Student: "Last night we watched a screening of the
last lecture of Edward Said [who was a Columbia U professor]. I was
proud to come to this school because of the incredible history it had
of being at the forefront of thought, especially progressive thought,
and activism. I am disgusted by how the Columbia administration
handled the current situation... We are the continuation of a long
line of activism on this campus, from the war movements of Vietnam to
South African apartheid. And those students [who protested] are now
considered heroes, the university looks on them with pride. It's
really ironic those people are now venerated, and we are villified. We
are doing exactly the same thing"</p>

<p>The Japan Times: "Japan’s biggest utility, JERA, is looking to invest
in low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia projects in the Middle East, in
addition to buying their output.</p>
<p>JERA has established a division for investing in such plants. Tsuyoshi
Oyama, who heads the unit’s Australia and Middle East activities, said
facilities that can produce around 1 million tons a year of "blue”
ammonia are attractive targets, as well as smaller "green” hydrogen
projects"</p>

<p>WION: "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has initiated an
investigation into claims made by the Society of Professional
Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) regarding alleged
retaliation by Boeing against two engineers in 2022. According to
Reuters, the union maintains that the engineers, who advocated for a
re-evaluation of previous engineering work on Boeing 777 and 787 jets,
faced negative consequences from the company following the incident"</p>

when some Tesla owners in Chicago discovered their EVs' batteries had

<p>Car Expert: "My local servo [gas station].. has eight liquid fuel
pumps and they can all be used simultaneously. The number of pumps is
not a random choice at any servo that number of pumps is there because
eight pumps in this case is the number that best services the peak
demand. Let us do a thought experiment.. transition to Electric Utopia
where the eight pumps are now eight rechargers all capable of pumping
50 kwatt hours into 8 EVS in just 5 minutes [an impossibility on its
own] Hallelujah.. what could possibly go    wrong? I'd suggest here's
what could go wrong: that's 400 kwatt hours of energy in 5 minutes,
think about that another way it's 400 kwatt hours delivered in 1/12th
of an hour which is uh 5 megawatt, more or less, to run one shitty
little suburban servo. Imagine rolling that out nationally to every
station.. [it] is just a preposterous infrastructure challenge"</p>

<p>TNR: "[A 2022 book <em>The Network State: How to Start a New Country</em>]..
outlines a plan for tech plutocrats to exit democracy and establish
new sovereign territories. I mentioned [its] ideas in two previous
stories about Network State–related efforts in California—a proposed
tech colony called California Forever and the tech-funded campaign to
capture San Francisco’s government...</p>
<p>'What I’m really calling for is something like tech Zionism,' [author]
said, after comparing his movement to those started by.. Theodor Herzl
('spiritual father' of the state of Israel).. . then revealed
his shocking ideas for a tech-governed city where citizens loyal to
tech companies would form a new political tribe clad in gray
t-shirts. 'And if you see another Gray on the street … you do the
nod,' he said, during a four-hour talk on the Moment of Zen
podcast. 'You’re a fellow Gray.'.. Grays would also receive special ID
cards providing access to exclusive, Gray-controlled sectors of the
city. In addition, the Grays would make an alliance with the police
department, funding weekly 'policeman’s banquets' to win them over"</p>

<p>Declassified UK: "UK military support for Israel’s genocide was
pre-planned.. In aiding Israel’s mass attacks on Palestinians in Gaza,
Britain is implementing an agreement openly signed with Netanyahu’s
far-right coalition – which has been almost entirely ignored in the UK
national media.</p>
<p>It explicitly states the two countries are 'natural allies' – ignoring
Israel’s pariah status among much of the rest of the world due its
illegal occupation of the West Bank and “apartheid” system
discriminating against Palestinians.</p>
<p>Notably, the Roadmap has a section entitled 'Antisemitism,
delegitimisation, and anti-Israel bias' whose wording directly
prophesies Britain’s extraordinary apologias for Israel’s Gaza
atrocities in international fora.</p>
<p>It calls for 'tackling the disproportionate focus on Israel in the UN
and other international bodies, including attempts to delegitimise it
or deny its right to self-defence. All states have a duty to comply
with their obligations under international law, but scrutiny must be
measured, impartial and proportionate'"</p>
