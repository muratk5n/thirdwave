<p>TNR: "[A 2022 book <em>The Network State: How to Start a New Country</em>]..
outlines a plan for tech plutocrats to exit democracy and establish
new sovereign territories. I mentioned [its] ideas in two previous
stories about Network State–related efforts in California—a proposed
tech colony called California Forever and the tech-funded campaign to
capture San Francisco’s government...</p>
<p>'What I’m really calling for is something like tech Zionism,' [author]
said, after comparing his movement to those started by.. Theodor Herzl
('spiritual father' of the state of Israel).. . then revealed
his shocking ideas for a tech-governed city where citizens loyal to
tech companies would form a new political tribe clad in gray
t-shirts. 'And if you see another Gray on the street … you do the
nod,' he said, during a four-hour talk on the Moment of Zen
podcast. 'You’re a fellow Gray.'.. Grays would also receive special ID
cards providing access to exclusive, Gray-controlled sectors of the
city. In addition, the Grays would make an alliance with the police
department, funding weekly 'policeman’s banquets' to win them over"</p>

<p>Declassified UK: "UK military support for Israel’s genocide was
pre-planned.. In aiding Israel’s mass attacks on Palestinians in Gaza,
Britain is implementing an agreement openly signed with Netanyahu’s
far-right coalition – which has been almost entirely ignored in the UK
national media.</p>
<p>It explicitly states the two countries are 'natural allies' – ignoring
Israel’s pariah status among much of the rest of the world due its
illegal occupation of the West Bank and “apartheid” system
discriminating against Palestinians.</p>
<p>Notably, the Roadmap has a section entitled 'Antisemitism,
delegitimisation, and anti-Israel bias' whose wording directly
prophesies Britain’s extraordinary apologias for Israel’s Gaza
atrocities in international fora.</p>
<p>It calls for 'tackling the disproportionate focus on Israel in the UN
and other international bodies, including attempts to delegitimise it
or deny its right to self-defence. All states have a duty to comply
with their obligations under international law, but scrutiny must be
measured, impartial and proportionate'"</p>
