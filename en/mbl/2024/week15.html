<p>Nick Bano: "[The root of a lot of the high rent problems] goes back to
Margaret Thatcher and to Tony Blair because of course while it's right
to point out that Thatcher dismantled rent controls what kept the
landlords in check for most of the 20th century was that they were
scared that whenever the Tories were generous to landlords Labor would
come and turn it around again. When you have a long-term investment
like land that tended to keep the landlords at Bay a bit. So when Tony
Blair said rent controls are never coming back "I'm keeping what that
Thatcher had", that signals to the landlords to go wild"</p>

<p>Third way (not to be confused with third wave) was a faux philophical
cover for the left to act like right-wingers under a slick new
label. It was an unplanned, clumsy mess and along with the problem
leaving huge swaths of ideological spectrum unattended it naturally
caused chaos, and in the long-term (today) misery. But since the
proponents who pushed this ideology were also creating crises at the
same time they could conveniently look like heroes fighting them with
their half-assed band-aid solutions. The approach was ineffective, but
during the post Berlin Wall euphoria many did not care, mostly
chalking up the problems to the birth pangs of something new. It was
nothing new, it was something old. Rich getting richer poor getting
poorer.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Nation: "British Prime Minister Tony Blair euphorically announced
[90s], third-way thinking was.. [a] governing philosophy for the

War undertaking: discrediting and marginalizing movement-based
coalitions on the left, stigmatizing them as holdovers from the
recently resolved‚Äîin capitalism‚Äôs favor‚Äîpostwar clash of
ideologies. In many ways, the most lasting legacy of the third way may
well be its determination to consign the political left to the dustbin
of history, setting the stage for the new millennial age of reaction

<p>Looking at the passage <a href="../../2024/04/end-times-turchin.html">here</a>, it
becomes clear US libertarianism is not some extreme ideology for the
Anglo-centric folk.</p>
<p>"[T]hanks to its protected position in the British Isles, once England
conquered all of them, it could, and did, dispense with the standing
army.. The squirearchy, which started as a military class, gradually
lost its military character.. The early American Republic was an
oligarchy modeled after the United Kingdom".</p>
<p>Libertarians are against most things military, and are for extreme
free trade, right? Well those wishes have their basis in the the Anglo
past. Dispensing with the standing army, check. Plutocracy, check.</p>
<p>Now there are negatives associated with that. The region specific,
local roots makes libertarianism less universal. It has bizarre
hangups some of which are vaguely applicable to today, some not. It is
excessively against anything military, that would be good for
curtailing excessive mil spending and defang the military-industrial
complex, but can we reach a just and equitable society out of such a
British Isles centric ideology? Uncurtailed capitalism is at the root
of many ills today. I'm afraid its past makes this ideology a bit
provencial, marginal.</p>

<p>"The 'Buy, Borrow, Die' strategy has been adopted by affluent
individuals who enlist the aid of financial planning specialists to
maintain their lavish lifestyles while minimizing taxes... First, a
wealthy person must have a high amount of wealth and use that wealth
to buy assets... After acquiring assets that will appreciate, the next
logical step is to take out loans secured by these assets. In other
words, those resources can be utilized as collateral for borrowed
money. Instead of selling your investments for cash and triggering
capital gains taxes, you could borrow money by pledging your assets as
a surety. Not only are you not liable for capital gains tax, but the
loan proceeds will not be taxable income... [after death] those
receiving your estate can use the assets you have bequeathed to settle
any loans... [the heirs] pay zero taxes under current law. Or they
could use the buy, borrow, die strategy on the inherited assets and

world.. basically take all of the possible perceptual states that
exist in the realm of driving, and produce the correct perceptual
signals, that result from that, under all circumstances. And they're
pouring massive amounts of training data and making that happen,
running.. tests in shadow mode to collect, triggers that then feed
more labels, back to the labeling team to run that data loop.</p>
<p>[The aim seems to be..] that singularity moment where the function
converges and and has memorized infinity. And.. as, you know, I've
kind of talked to you about, so far, I do not believe that that's
possible.. Obviously, neural networks are finite machines. They
operate under finite compute constraints with finite memory. It may be
possible to build a neural network, that could indeed memorize
infinity given, an infinite number of layers and infinite number of,
you know, fully connected neurons, infinite compute and memory to
execute that model. But given the compute constraints in a Tesla
vehicle, I don't think that's possible to achieve"</p>

<p>ML Street Talk Podcast: "George [Morgan] quit Tesla because he thought
that the way that they were proposing to fix autopilot, in particular
to fix the "San Francisco problem" for autopilot was just way more
data for San Francisco specifically and just.. throwing compute at the
wall. And so.. George's thought was 'this can't be the right way to do
it'.. 'I wanna take a position against scale.. It kinda feels like
they're trying to memorize infinity'"</p>

<p>NYT: "Hertz Will Shrink Electric Fleet.. The rental car [Hertz]
company blamed the sharp drop in the value of electric vehicles and
higher repair costs for its decision to sell 20,000 cars. The rental
car company Hertz will be selling about one-third of the electric
vehicles in its fleet after they lost value more quickly than
expected".</p>

<p>The "rebels" who do not like the rules are like intrepid
enterpreneurs, they are too cool to be at school or skooled, they are
just awesome in the way they are, simply for being different, gender
diverse, fluid binary or whatever.. Starfleet is like government, of
course it is painted as bad because the corps who fund these shows
prefer it, they are scared of any insitution that is not theirs, and
is capable to tax their ass one day.</p>
<hr />
<p>It seems they emphasized the usual message via subliminal parallels
btw Starfleet and Government, brainwashing against the essence of
both. Anti-government, pro-corporate ideology..</p>
<p>The Bulwark: "What does it mean if we can‚Äôt even trust the
institutions in our imagined utopias?.. Starfleet, for those not also
raised on Star Trek, is the exploratory, scientific, diplomatic, and
military arm of the United Federation of Planets.. But whatever else
Starfleet is, it is <em>good</em>.. Things are different in modern Trek [Jar
Jar Ibrahim era]... Starfleet as an institution often plays a
partially antagonistic role in [newer] shows. By the time of <em>Picard</em>,
the titular paragon has quit Starfleet in a huff because it no longer
lives up to his principles, and in both seasons one and three it is
revealed that Starfleet has been compromised by hostile alien agents
and cannot be trusted. The first season of <em>Discovery</em> ends with
Starfleet condoning genocide, only to be stopped by our heroic crew;
Season 2‚Äôs villain was an out-of-control Starfleet AI that threatened
all life in the galaxy; and Seasons 3 and 4 keep the crew in
near-constant conflict with Starfleet and/or Federation brass. <em>Lower
Decks</em> is centered on the adventures of a low-level officer who
routinely defies Starfleet regulations to help nearby planets in ways
that Starfleet would not condone. Even <em>Strange New Worlds</em>, the most
archetypal of the modern shows, emphasizes how unjust some of
Starfleet‚Äôs rules are"</p>

<p>Scientific American: "[2022] JWST's First Glimpses of Early Galaxies
Could Break Cosmology.. [soon after JWST came online] dozens of galaxy
candidates.. sprang into view with estimated redshifts as high as
20‚Äîjust 180 million years after the big bang‚Äîsome with disklike
structures that were not expected to manifest so early in cosmic
history... Such behemoths emerging so rapidly defies expectations set
by cosmologists' standard model of the universe's evolution. In the
first second after the [so called] big bang, our universe was an
almost inconceivably hot and dense soup of primordial
particles... This process of becoming, of the early universe's chaos
giving way to the more orderly cosmos we know today, is thought to
have taken about a billion years. JWST's discovery of bright galaxies
in the early cosmos challenges this model"</p>
