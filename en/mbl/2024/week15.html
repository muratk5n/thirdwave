<p>Looking at the passage <a href="../../2024/04/end-times-turchin.html">here</a>, it
becomes clear US libertarianism is not some extreme ideology for the
Anglo-centric folk.</p>
<p>"[T]hanks to its protected position in the British Isles, once England
conquered all of them, it could, and did, dispense with the standing
army.. The squirearchy, which started as a military class, gradually
lost its military character.. The early American Republic was an
oligarchy modeled after the United Kingdom".</p>
<p>Libertarians are against most things military, and are for extreme
free trade, right? Well those wishes have their basis in the the Anglo
past. Dispensing with the standing army, check. Plutocracy, check.</p>
<p>Now there are negatives associated with that. The region specific,
local roots makes libertarianism less universal. It has bizarre
hangups some of which are vaguely applicable to today, some not. It is
excessively against anything military, that would be good for
curtailing excessive mil spending and defang the military-industrial
complex, but can we reach a just and equitable society out of such a
British Isles centric ideology? Uncurtailed capitalism is at the root
of many ills today. I'm afraid its past makes this ideology a bit
provencial, marginal.</p>

<p>One of the 1000 ways the top 1% can avoid tax.. </p>
<p>"The 'Buy, Borrow, Die' strategy has been adopted by affluent
individuals who enlist the aid of financial planning specialists to
maintain their lavish lifestyles while minimizing taxes... First, a
wealthy person must have a high amount of wealth and use that wealth
to buy assets... After acquiring assets that will appreciate, the next
logical step is to take out loans secured by these assets. In other
words, those resources can be utilized as collateral for borrowed
money. Instead of selling your investments for cash and triggering
capital gains taxes, you could borrow money by pledging your assets as
a surety. Not only are you not liable for capital gains tax, but the
loan proceeds will not be taxable income... [after death] those
receiving your estate can use the assets you have bequeathed to settle
any loans... [the heirs] pay zero taxes under current law. Or they
could use the buy, borrow, die strategy on the inherited assets and
repeat the cycle"</p>

<p>OnLabor: "[01/30] SpaceX and Trader Joe’s are attacking the
constitutionality of the [National Labor Relations Board]. While their
arguments may be novel, their strategy is not. After the Wagner Act’s
passage in 1935, employers across the country openly flouted the law,
arguing that it was unconstitutional. They had reason to think the
Supreme Court might agree: it had previously struck
down wage and hour laws and defended yellow-dog contracts in the name
of the Constitution. More recently, the Court had stymied President
Roosevelt’s early attempts to regulate labor relations by voiding the
National Industrial Recovery Act. But the Lochner era drew to a close
after Roosevelt’s threats to pack the Court, and the justices
finally upheld the NLRB’s constitutionality in 1937.</p>
<p>Undaunted by the many decades of intervening precedent, today’s
employers are once again ignoring labor law in hopes of capitalizing
on a sympathetic judiciary"</p>

<p>Although pro-rich ideology derived some benefits from TS doing cool
things, he was nevertheless portrayed as a faulty man so naturally he
would side with the government for the accords, the central theme of
<em>Civil War</em>. TS death / sacrifice at the end was his redemption for
the mistakes he'd made previously. For being vengeful perhaps
(attacking a friend for avenging the death of his parents), being a
jackass, showoff in general, even creating a killerbot by mistake.</p>
<p>The real hero of the saga, the unblemished examplar of the previous
phases was Cap. He has honor, is cool, he is always on the "right
side". He is so deserving of that mystic mojo he can lift Thor's
hammer because he is that freaking great (a twist set up like 10
movies earlier, in <em>Age of Ultron</em>, it paid off in <em>Endgame</em>). And that
guy, the shit, the man with "America's Ass" chose to be
anti-government when the government asked him to sign an accord that
wasn't even slightly offensive. The studios planted a subliminal
message this way, they said government is no good, if it were, Captain
America would be on their side (so remember that viewer when they come
to tax our corporation one day, wink wink, you have to be
anti-government like Steve Rodgers, so you too can have that mojo -and
we continue paying no tax-).</p>

<p>ML Street Talk Podcast: "[I]f you look at, the AI Day presentations
that effectively go into deep technical detail about how Tesla learns
the world, or Andrei's talk at NeurIPS 2 years ago.. Tesla very much
is trying to come up with a function that memorizes the
world.. basically take all of the possible perceptual states that
exist in the realm of driving, and produce the correct perceptual
signals, that result from that, under all circumstances. And they're
pouring massive amounts of training data and making that happen,
running.. tests in shadow mode to collect, triggers that then feed
more labels, back to the labeling team to run that data loop.</p>
<p>[The aim seems to be..] that singularity moment where the function
converges and and has memorized infinity. And.. as, you know, I've
kind of talked to you about, so far, I do not believe that that's
possible.. Obviously, neural networks are finite machines. They
operate under finite compute constraints with finite memory. It may be
possible to build a neural network, that could indeed memorize
infinity given, an infinite number of layers and infinite number of,
you know, fully connected neurons, infinite compute and memory to
execute that model. But given the compute constraints in a Tesla
vehicle, I don't think that's possible to achieve"</p>

it'.. 'I wanna take a position against scale.. It kinda feels like

Starfleet is, it is <em>good</em>.. Things are different in modern Trek [Jar
Jar Ibrahim era]... Starfleet as an institution often plays a
partially antagonistic role in [newer] shows. By the time of <em>Picard</em>,
the titular paragon has quit Starfleet in a huff because it no longer
lives up to his principles, and in both seasons one and three it is
revealed that Starfleet has been compromised by hostile alien agents
and cannot be trusted. The first season of <em>Discovery</em> ends with
Starfleet condoning genocide, only to be stopped by our heroic crew;
Season 2’s villain was an out-of-control Starfleet AI that threatened
all life in the galaxy; and Seasons 3 and 4 keep the crew in
near-constant conflict with Starfleet and/or Federation brass. <em>Lower
Decks</em> is centered on the adventures of a low-level officer who
routinely defies Starfleet regulations to help nearby planets in ways
that Starfleet would not condone. Even <em>Strange New Worlds</em>, the most
archetypal of the modern shows, emphasizes how unjust some of
Starfleet’s rules are"</p>
