<h1>Week 2</h1>
<p>Andersen: "Back in the 1930s and ’40s, there had been very left-wing
Democrats with serious national prominence and significant political
bases. Franklin Roosevelt’s own vice president Henry Wallace was one,
as most notably was Senator Huey Long of Louisiana, who introduced
bills in the 1930s to enact a 100 percent income tax on earnings over
the equivalent of $20 million and a wealth tax of 100 percent on
everything over 1 billion dollars. Which made the president seem
moderate when his 1935 'Soak the Rich Act' raised the tax on income
over 2 million to 55 percent. 'Political equality,' FDR said in 1936,
is 'meaningless in the face of economic inequality.' In what he
pitched as a Second Bill of Rights, he proposed guaranteeing all
Americans 'the right to earn enough' for 'a decent living' and 'a
decent home' and to have 'adequate medical care' paid for with 'a tax
[on] all unreasonable profits, both individual and corporate.' That
was 1944, Peak Leftism for Democrats on economics"</p>
<hr />
<p>A side-effect of WT would be asset prices falling, bcz the rich would
look to sell some of the assets to cover the tax bill, if enough sell,
price falls, and that is good for the low-to-moderate-income folk.</p>
<hr />
<p>States should pass Wealth Tax proposals, federal one needed too to
close the 34 trillion dollar federal debt hole.</p>
<hr />
<p>US median home price is nearly half a million freaking dollars. This
is insane.</p>
<hr />
<p>Multi-generational mortgage.. the real message here is <em>house prices
are that high</em>. </p>
<hr />
<p>What a daft son of a bitch. Brexit was a scam, migration did not stop
and there is still inequality. Instead of adressing the problem they
talked about stuff like this.</p>
<p>The Independent: "[2022] Boris Johnson wants ‘multi-generational’
mortgages so parents can pass on debt to children"</p>
<hr />
<p>Bitcoin turned into an asset; enough people believe in it, which
creates some liquidity. Hell If the wealthy sink their money into that
instead of housing that cld be a good thing, would be a small change
surely but it cld help. BTC itself though is far away from its ideals
which was supplanting fiat currencies, instead it became a plaything
for the ultra rich. Look at their stupid commercials and endorsements
for this thing, all those promoters are loaded, they dont know where
to put their f-ing money anymore so they latch on to anything that has
some liquidity behind it.</p>

how long they would take, ask for resources, give a timeline. This is

of rugged, frontiersy, stronger, better America", and "a winsome 1950s
actor in a cowboy hat" was the frontman for that sale. There aren't
that many Western movies now.. I wonder what replaced them as a
marketing vehicle for this "frontier mentality".. Superhero movies
maybe..? Look at Batman - he is like Ronald Reagan with a hero
suit. He seems to inhabit a non-governmental world where he "fights
bad people" whenever he wants, without asking the government. A
crime-fighting enterpreneur.. A disruptor. Sometimes the movies touch
the subject of vigilantism / government explicitly of course, but
maybe they "put a hat on it", making the propaganda into a story so

<p>Because this suboptimal idea was promoted by the First Black

your ass.. have no doubt nato expansion was always strategically
stupid but it creates a certain kerfuffle which was profitable for the
private "complex". That's how we ended up here.</p>

<p>But it does.. excessive wealth does not sit still, it seeks places to
be invested, that can be housing, raising their price, purchase price
effects rent price, which raises <em>your rent</em>. If you are spending more
on rent, you are spending less on eggs and bread. Grab your pitchfork.</p>
<p>"But other people's wealth does not effect me, that money does not chase
after my eggs and bread, it doesn't concern me"</p>

<p>Post 80s neoliberalism not only argued for certain choices, but after
"winning" it even took certain choices out of the dictionary. People
cannot even think, know some solutions even exist anymore. Nixon
instituted price controls. Eisenhower (a Republican remember) kept
high tax rates he inherited from the New Deal. Today such high rates,
price controls cannot even be pronounced. Same is true for Wealth Tax.</p>

<p>That hole cannot be plugged any other way. Printing more money will
make more debt. </p>

<p>Every debt is balanced out with someone's credit. If there is debt
somewhere, directly or indirectly, someone else is holding that
debt. Last I checked the US Top 10% has 96 trillion dollars of

<p>Post-2020 inflation in the West occured bcz of limited-time direct
payments to people, that money came and went, so inflation naturally
came down. People who said inflation was transitionary were right.</p>
<hr />
<p>The FED likely wanted asset prices to come down IMO (stocks, housing)
through its rate rises but it failed to achive that objective. I
believe they realized that now, and changed course. Inequality is the
culprit. Usual mechanisms are not working. Govs need to take out
the big stick if they want to avoid pitchforks later.</p>
<hr />
<p>Judging recent econ events through inequality prism via Stevenson;
covid payments to people, even it went to them direct, still
contributed to inequality because everything they spent ended up with
the rich anyway (through corps they own, operate, have shares of).
Now govs are in more debt and the rich are richer because on top of
their existing wealth they ended up with the covid money as
well. Direct payments were necessary but govs always "forget" the next
step of such an action, taxing the rich to plug their debt.</p>
<p>Stevenson prediction on house prices was their prices would not fall
in a way that would make a difference even with higher rates, because
the wealthy, with their huge stash, could still buy homes without
needing a mortgage, either directly or through various investment
vehicles, so demand stayed high, prices did not fall.</p>
