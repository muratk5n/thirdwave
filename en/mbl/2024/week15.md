# Week 15

Author Michael Easter says along with long-distance travel carrying is
also a fundamental human skill. The human body is built the way it is
so that "we could slowly but surely run down prey for miles and miles
in the heat until the animal toppled over from exhaustion". Then we‚Äôd
hunt it and carry it back to camp. This is why we have two legs, sweat
glands across our body, no fur, short torsos, and strong grips. IOW
rucking is cool. Be a rucker, not a mucker.

*Road House*, not bad, but i understand why it's theatre release was
canceled (there was some drama there w/ director crying
foul).. Entertaining enough, not that grand. McGregor has zero
presence. He constantly looks like he is doing a Cornholio imitation

This is how Microsoft survives. Monopoly rents on margins that are
only possible because your core good is non-rival and
non-exclusive. The fundamental problem with generative models is that
they are 10x too expensive to work with the industry‚Äôs default
business models and structure"

"@baldur@toot.cafe

Tech punditry keeps harping on the notion that nobody has ever
successfully banned 'scientific progress', but LLMs and generative
models are not 'progress'. They‚Äôre products and we ban those all the
time"

Nick Bano: "[The root of a lot of the high rent problems] goes back to
Margaret Thatcher and to Tony Blair because of course while it's right
to point out that Thatcher dismantled rent controls what kept the
landlords in check for most of the 20th century was that they were
scared that whenever the Tories were generous to landlords Labor would
come and turn it around again. When you have a long-term investment
like land that tended to keep the landlords at Bay a bit. So when Tony
Blair said rent controls are never coming back "I'm keeping what that
Thatcher had", that signals to the landlords to go wild"

Third way (not to be confused with third wave) was a faux philophical
cover for the left to act like right-wingers under a slick new
label. It was an unplanned, clumsy mess and along with the problem
leaving huge swaths of ideological spectrum unattended it naturally
caused chaos, and in the long-term (today) misery. But since the
proponents who pushed this ideology were also creating crises at the
same time they could conveniently look like heroes fighting them with
their half-assed band-aid solutions. The approach was ineffective, but
during the post Berlin Wall euphoria many did not care, mostly
chalking up the problems to the birth pangs of something new. It was
nothing new, it was something old. Rich getting richer poor getting
poorer.

---

The Nation: "British Prime Minister Tony Blair euphorically announced
[90s], third-way thinking was.. [a] governing philosophy for the
future... The third way.. proved instrumental to another key post‚ÄìCold
War undertaking: discrediting and marginalizing movement-based
coalitions on the left, stigmatizing them as holdovers from the
recently resolved‚Äîin capitalism‚Äôs favor‚Äîpostwar clash of
ideologies. In many ways, the most lasting legacy of the third way may
well be its determination to consign the political left to the dustbin
of history, setting the stage for the new millennial age of reaction
and crisis"

For one transgression they blockaded Greece? Those were the days. Now
they would give Greece more weapons.

Unherd: "In 1847 David Pacifico, a British subject resident in Athens,
had his home stormed by a mob... As that happened, the Athenian police
did nothing. Pacifico immediately wrote to the British authorities in
Greece to explain what had taken place. In turn they approached the
Greek government asking Pacifico to be compensated. Athens refused to
do anything ‚Äî twice. As a result Lord Palmerston, then Foreign
Secretary, instructed Sir William Parker, Commander-in-Chief of the
Mediterranean Fleet, to impose a blockade of Athens and requisition
the country‚Äôs navy"

Looking at the passage [here](../../2024/04/end-times-turchin.html), it
becomes clear US libertarianism is not some extreme ideology for the
Anglo-centric folk.

"[T]hanks to its protected position in the British Isles, once England
conquered all of them, it could, and did, dispense with the standing
army.. The squirearchy, which started as a military class, gradually
lost its military character.. The early American Republic was an
oligarchy modeled after the United Kingdom".

Libertarians are against most things military, and are for extreme
free trade, right? Well those wishes have their basis in the the Anglo
past. Dispensing with the standing army, check. Plutocracy, check.

Now there are negatives associated with that. The region specific,
local roots makes libertarianism less universal. It has bizarre
hangups some of which are vaguely applicable to today, some not. It is
excessively against anything military, that would be good for
curtailing excessive mil spending and defang the military-industrial
complex, but can we reach a just and equitable society out of such a
British Isles centric ideology? Uncurtailed capitalism is at the root
of many ills today. I'm afraid its past makes this ideology a bit
provencial, marginal.

"@GeePawHill@mastodon.social

One of the key facts here keeps getting sidestepped by a mixture of
scam marketing and common language usage out there.

LLMs don't *sometimes* make shit up, they *always* make shit up.

That's what an LLM *is*: a piece of software that makes up plausible
sounding shit.

What's impressive about this is the extent of improvement in the
plausibility.

What's horrifying about it is the extent to which so many people don't
care to distinguish between plausibility and correctness"

One of the 1000 ways the top 1% can avoid tax.. 

"The 'Buy, Borrow, Die' strategy has been adopted by affluent
individuals who enlist the aid of financial planning specialists to
maintain their lavish lifestyles while minimizing taxes... First, a
wealthy person must have a high amount of wealth and use that wealth
to buy assets... After acquiring assets that will appreciate, the next
logical step is to take out loans secured by these assets. In other
words, those resources can be utilized as collateral for borrowed
money. Instead of selling your investments for cash and triggering
capital gains taxes, you could borrow money by pledging your assets as
a surety. Not only are you not liable for capital gains tax, but the
loan proceeds will not be taxable income... [after death] those
receiving your estate can use the assets you have bequeathed to settle
any loans... [the heirs] pay zero taxes under current law. Or they
could use the buy, borrow, die strategy on the inherited assets and
repeat the cycle"

Paper: "Did Austerity Cause Brexit?.. The fiscal contraction brought
about by the Conservative-led government starting in 2010 was sizable:
aggregate real government spending on welfare and social protection
decreased by around 16 percent per capita. At the district level, the
level at which most administration of welfare spending takes place,
welfare spending per person fell by 23.4 percent in real terms between
2010 and 2015.. Using data from government estimates on the expected
intensity of specific welfare cuts across districts, I show that
support for UKIP started to grow in areas with significant exposure to
specific benefit cuts after these became effective"

OnLabor: "[01/30] SpaceX and Trader Joe‚Äôs are attacking the
constitutionality of the [National Labor Relations Board]. While their
arguments may be novel, their strategy is not. After the Wagner Act‚Äôs
passage in 1935, employers across the country openly flouted the law,
arguing that it was unconstitutional. They had reason to think the
Supreme Court might agree: it had previously struck
down¬†wage¬†and¬†hour¬†laws and defended¬†yellow-dog¬†contracts in the name
of the Constitution. More recently, the Court had stymied President
Roosevelt‚Äôs early attempts to regulate labor relations by¬†voiding¬†the
National Industrial Recovery Act. But the¬†Lochner¬†era drew to a close
after Roosevelt‚Äôs threats to pack the Court, and the justices
finally¬†upheld¬†the NLRB‚Äôs constitutionality in 1937.

Undaunted by the many decades of intervening precedent, today‚Äôs
employers are once again ignoring labor law in hopes of capitalizing
on a sympathetic judiciary"

Although pro-rich ideology derived some benefits from TS doing cool
things, he was nevertheless portrayed as a faulty man so naturally he
would side with the government for the accords, the central theme of
*Civil War*. TS death / sacrifice at the end was his redemption for
the mistakes he'd made previously. For being vengeful perhaps
(attacking a friend for avenging the death of his parents), being a
jackass, showoff in general, even creating a killerbot by mistake.

The real hero of the saga, the unblemished examplar of the previous
phases was Cap. He has honor, is cool, he is always on the "right
side". He is so deserving of that mystic mojo he can lift Thor's
hammer because he is that freaking great (a twist set up like 10
movies earlier, in *Age of Ultron*, it paid off in *Endgame*). And that
guy, the shit, the man with "America's Ass" chose to be
anti-government when the government asked him to sign an accord that
wasn't even slightly offensive. The studios planted a subliminal
message this way, they said government is no good, if it were, Captain
America would be on their side (so remember that viewer when they come
to tax our corporation one day, wink wink, you have to be
anti-government like Steve Rodgers, so you too can have that mojo -and
we continue paying no tax-).

NYT: "[2020/03] A $60 Billion Housing Grab by Wall Street.. By 2016,
95 percent of the distressed mortgages on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac‚Äôs
books were auctioned off to Wall Street investors without any
meaningful stipulations, and private-equity firms had acquired more
than 200,000 homes in desirable cities and middle-class suburban
neighborhoods, creating a tantalizing new asset class: the
single-family-rental home. The companies would make money on rising
home values while tenants covered the mortgages...

Wall Street‚Äôs latest real estate grab has ballooned to roughly $60
billion, representing hundreds of thousands of properties. In some
communities, it has fundamentally altered housing ecosystems in ways
we‚Äôre only now beginning to understand, fueling a housing recovery
without a homeowner recovery"

"Google Is Killing.. Independent Sites.. Since September 2023, Google
has hidden our site from millions of [our potential viewers], reducing
our organic traffic and revenue by 85% and causing our business to be
on the edge of going under... Google‚Äôs search results are no longer
fair and no longer abide by their own guidelines, which they
repeatedly share with website owners when they speak up, alongside
Google‚Äôs spokespersons replying with cover-up quotes such as 'make
better content for your readers'...

Google continuously states (and very publicly) that their goal is to
show helpful content, to reduce spam, and make the search results
fairer to all sized websites. But the opposite is happening, and
aggressively. Google‚Äôs algorithms now favor a handful of results
BEFORE 'normal' websites, results that rarely show independent
websites..

Google wants to completely eradicate users leaving their search
results and will now show you their own 'From Sources' answers to
search terms. These answers are taken without consent from the
publisher‚Äôs content and are stolen from creators‚Äô work so that Google
can give you 'their' answer instead, lowering the chances of readers
exploring websites‚Ä¶ the websites that are paying to create the exact
content that Google now shows for themself"

ML Street Talk Podcast: "[I]f you look at, the AI Day presentations
that effectively go into deep technical detail about how Tesla learns
the world, or Andrei's talk at NeurIPS 2 years ago.. Tesla very much
is trying to come up with a function that memorizes the
world.. basically take all of the possible perceptual states that
exist in the realm of driving, and produce the correct perceptual
signals, that result from that, under all circumstances. And they're
pouring massive amounts of training data and making that happen,
running.. tests in shadow mode to collect, triggers that then feed
more labels, back to the labeling team to run that data loop.

[The aim seems to be..] that singularity moment where the function
converges and and has memorized infinity. And.. as, you know, I've
kind of talked to you about, so far, I do not believe that that's
possible.. Obviously, neural networks are finite machines. They
operate under finite compute constraints with finite memory. It may be
possible to build a neural network, that could indeed memorize
infinity given, an infinite number of layers and infinite number of,
you know, fully connected neurons, infinite compute and memory to
execute that model. But given the compute constraints in a Tesla
vehicle, I don't think that's possible to achieve"

ML Street Talk Podcast: "George [Morgan] quit Tesla because he thought
that the way that they were proposing to fix autopilot, in particular
to fix the "San Francisco problem" for autopilot was just way more

it'.. 'I wanna take a position against scale.. It kinda feels like
they're trying to memorize infinity'"

The "rebels" who do not like the rules are like intrepid

just awesome in the way they are, simply for being different, gender

It seems they emphasized the usual message via subliminal parallels
btw Starfleet and Government, brainwashing against the essence of
both. Anti-government, pro-corporate ideology..

The Bulwark: "What does it mean if we can‚Äôt even trust the
institutions in our imagined utopias?.. Starfleet, for those not also
raised on Star Trek, is the exploratory, scientific, diplomatic, and
military arm of the United Federation of Planets.. But whatever else
Starfleet is, it is *good*.. Things are different in modern Trek [Jar
Jar Ibrahim era]... Starfleet as an institution often plays a
partially antagonistic role in [newer] shows. By the time of *Picard*,
the titular paragon has quit Starfleet in a huff because it no longer
lives up to his principles, and in both seasons one and three it is
revealed that Starfleet has been compromised by hostile alien agents
and cannot be trusted. The first season of *Discovery* ends with
Starfleet condoning genocide, only to be stopped by our heroic crew;
Season 2‚Äôs villain was an out-of-control Starfleet AI that threatened
all life in the galaxy; and Seasons 3 and 4 keep the crew in
near-constant conflict with Starfleet and/or Federation brass. *Lower
Decks* is centered on the adventures of a low-level officer who
routinely defies Starfleet regulations to help nearby planets in ways
that Starfleet would not condone. Even *Strange New Worlds*, the most
archetypal of the modern shows, emphasizes how unjust some of
Starfleet‚Äôs rules are"
