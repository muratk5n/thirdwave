<p>Radboud University: "Don’t believe the hype: AGI is far from
inevitable.. Creating artificial general intelligence (AGI) with
human-level cognition is ‘impossible’, explains Iris van Rooij, lead
author of the paper and professor of Computational Cognitive
Science.. at Radboud University. ‘Some argue that AGI is possible in
principle, that it’s only a matter of time before we have computers
that can think like humans think. But principle isn’t enough to make
it actually doable. Our paper explains why chasing this goal is a
fool’s errand, and a waste of humanity’s resources.’.. ‘There will
never be enough computing power to create AGI using machine learning
that can do the same, because we’d run out of natural resources long
before we'd even get close,’ [coworker] Olivia adds"</p>

<p>Declassified UK: "Israel’s largest arms firm Elbit Systems is finally
losing money at its drone engine factory near Birmingham,
England. This follows years of campaigning by Palestine Action, a
group I co-founded in 2020. Back then, Elbit’s subsidiary UAV Engines
was making millions of pounds in profit with an £11m turnover.</p>
<p>That was until we showed up. Palestine Action has staged over 20
protests at the firm’s factory in Shenstone, blockading the gates,
occupying the roof and smashing up equipment. We did this because
Elbit makes 85% of Israel’s drone fleet terrorising Gaza, including
the Hermes armed drones from which even British aid workers are not
safe.</p>
<p>And although UAV Engines claim that it produces components solely for
the British army, trade licence data shows it exports drone parts to
Israel. For decades this business, which Elbit turned from a motorbike
manufacturer to an arms firm in the mid-1990s, has been consistently
profitable.</p>

<hr />
<p>Isaacson, <em>Einstein</em>: "By now the siren song of a unified theory had
come to mesmerize Einstein... On his steamer ride through Asia, he
polished a new paper and, upon arriving in Egypt in February 1923,
immediately mailed it to Planck in Berlin for publication. His goal,
he declared, was 'to understand the gravitational and electromagnetic
field as one.'  Once again, Einstein’s pronouncements made headlines
around the world.  'Einstein Describes His Newest Theory,' proclaimed
the New York Times.  But this approach led nowhere, just like the
others...</p>
<p>In the world of physics, where quantum mechanics was now accepted,
Einstein and his fitful quest for a unified theory were beginning to
be seen as quaint. But in the popular imagination, he was still a
superstar. The frenzy that surrounded the publication of his January
1929 five-page paper, which was merely the latest in a string of
theoretical stabs that missed the mark, was astonishing. Journalists
from around the world crowded around his apartment building, and
Einstein was barely able to escape them to go into hiding at his
doctor’s villa on the Havel River outside of town. The New York Times
had started the drumbeat weeks earlier with an article headlined
'Einstein on Verge of Great Discovery: Resents Intrusion.'.. </p>
<p>Even before his little paper was published, he gave an interview about
it to a British newspaper. 'It has been my greatest ambition to
resolve the duality of natural laws into unity,' he said. “The purpose
of my work is to further this simplification, and particularly to
reduce to one formula the explanation of the gravitational and
electromagnetic fields. For this reason I call it a contribution to ‘a
unified field theory’... Now, but only now, we know that the force
that moves electrons in their ellipses about the nuclei of atoms is
the same force that moves our earth in its annual course around the
sun.' Of course, it turned out that he did not know that, nor do we
know that even now.</p>
<p>When [the paper] was released on January 30.. The New York Herald
Tribune decided to print the entire paper verbatim, but it had trouble
figuring out how to cable all the Greek letters and symbols over
telegraph machines.  So it hired some Columbia physics professors to
devise a coding system and then reconstruct the paper in New York,
which they did. The Tribune’ s colorful article about how they
transmitted the paper was a lot more comprehensible to most readers
than Einstein’s paper itself. The New York Times, for its part, raised
the unified theory to a religious level by sending reporters that
Sunday to churches around the city to report on the sermons about
it. 'Einstein Viewed as Near Mystic,' the headline declared...</p>
<p>Theologians and journalists may have been wowed, but physicists were
not. Eddington, usually a fan, expressed doubts. Over the next year,
Einstein kept refining his theory and insisting to friends that the
equations were 'beautiful.'  But he admitted to his dear sister that
his work had elicited 'the lively mistrust and passionate rejection of
my colleagues.'  Among those who were dismayed was Wolfgang
Pauli.</p>
<p>[Later] he turned his attention to yet another revised approach that
would make more headlines but not more headway in solving the great
riddle he had set for himself. 'Einstein Completes Unified Field
Theory,' the New York Times reported on January 23, 1931, with little
intimation that it was neither the first nor would it be the last time
there would be such an announcement. And then again, on October 26 of
that year: 'Einstein Announces a New Field Theory.'.. And so it went,
for another two decades. None of Einstein’s offerings ever resulted in
a successful unified field theory"</p>
<hr />
<p>After he arrived to America they turned him into a celebrity, that
probably did not help his work... He'd made a mistake with GR and that
mistake became entrenched, not reversed, to top it off the next
generation of scientists would try to connect with that broken theory
rather than go back to drawing board and try something else.
Einstein's undeserved celebrity status and US culture's treatment /
expectation of science held back fundamental research for nearly a
century now.</p>

<p>Politico: "The nation’s housing affordability crisis has become so
acute that even our presidential candidates are paying attention to
it...</p>
<p>But the number of  housing units in the nation has grown faster than
the number of households since the turn of the century. Something else
is happening here.</p>
<p>That’s because demand for real estate is not just about the number of
people who need homes, it’s also about the amount of money buyers are
bringing into the market. People without money cannot push up
prices. It’s the people with money — especially those with a lot of
money — who drive up prices for everyone else"</p>

<p>Schahill, <em>Blackwater</em>: "[Naomi] Klein, who traveled to Iraq during
Bremer's tenure in the country and has written extensively on.. the
effects of his edict-based governance as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Bremer] enacted a radical set of laws unprecedented in their
generosity to multinational corporations. There was Order 37, which
lowered Iraq's corporate tax rate from roughly 40 percent to a flat 15
percent. There was Order 39, which allowed foreign companies to own
100 percent of Iraqi assets outside of the natural-resource
sector. Even better, investors could take 100 percent of the profits
they made in Iraq out of the country; they would not be required to
reinvest and they would not be taxed. Under Order 39, they could sign
leases and contracts that would last for forty years. Order 40
welcomed foreign banks to Iraq under the same favorable terms. All
that remained of Saddam Hussein's economic policies was a law
restricting trade unions and collective bargaining...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems appropriate, then, that Bremer, the senior U.S. official in
Iraq, the public face of the occupation, would not be protected by
U.S. government forces or Iraqi security but rather by a private
mercenary company"</p>
