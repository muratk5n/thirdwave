milestone in the growing, if scattershot, revolt against big tech.. We
know that self-driving cars are wildly divisive, especially in cities
where they‚Äôve begun to share the streets with emergency responders,
pedestrians and cyclists. Public confidence in the technology has
actually been declining as they‚Äôve rolled out, owing as much to
general anxiety over driverless cars as to high-profile incidents like
a GM Cruise robotaxi trapping, dragging, and critically injuring a
pedestrian last fall. Just over a third of Americans say they‚Äôd ride

philosophy, a new epistemological theory that explains how brains
create explanatory knowledge, and hence defines in principle without
ever running them as programs which algorithms possess that
functionality and which do not.  Such a theory is beyond present day
knowledge. What we do know about epistemology implies that any

<p>McManus: "One of the sad truths about American socialist writers
post-1980 is they‚Äôve struggled to reach a wide audience (despite the
fact that there are plenty of societal conditions to be unhappy about,
which could be used to spark a reader‚Äôs interest in alternatives to
capitalism). This is in part due to the sheer ideological clout and
vast resources poured into defending neoliberal capitalism at the
climax of the Cold War and after it. This effort was so pervasive that
even many leftists became closet Fukuyamaists, convinced we had
reached 'the end of history.' (As the idea went, after the fall of
Communism, there was simply no better kind of society that could be
envisioned other than Western liberal democracy.)</p>
<p>But.. this failure was also partially a result of the socialist left
retreating into intellectual, artistic, and academic spaces in the
aftermath of failed ‚Äô60s radicalism. One consequence of this is that
socialists tended to adopt the tone, style, and expectations aligned
with those communities: writing for a select audience that valued
dense intellectualism, self-conscious novelty, and insular
referentiality over more democratic and popular styles"</p>
