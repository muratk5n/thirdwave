In other words expanding universe theories are wrong. The universe is static.
There was no Big Bang.

Paper: "In recent years, some observational hints have emerged
indicating that the Standard Cosmological Model could require
correcting. One of these hints is related to the discovery of remote
galaxies whose redshifts correspond to the very young Universe (less
than one billion years after the Big Bang) but which are similar to
nearby galaxies. The issue is that such galaxies in the early Universe
do not have enough time to evolve into something similar to the
late-Universe galaxies...

We compare this result with predictions of the standard ŒõCDM [Big
Bang] cosmological model and some static cosmological models,
including Zwicky‚Äôs.. model. The latter is currently assumed to be
ruled out by observations. We challenge this assumption and show that
a static model can provide a natural and straightforward way of
solving the puzzle of the well-evolved galaxies and better agreements
with the results of the JWST 'angular diameter‚Äîredshift' test at
higher redshifts than the correcting evolution model within the ŒõCDM
framework"

It's clear to me there's a crisis in #peerreview. As an academic
editor it's been close-to-impossible to get good reviewers since
~2021. This year I see the symptoms in many 'good' journals in my
field: they repeatedly invite me to review or edit the same paper I've
already declined. True even of the 'top' journals, even though I'd
expect their staff to be paid and experienced enough. (Solutions? I
don't know. Pay reviewers? Open peer review systems like PCI?)"

Ars Technica: "One of the most unlikely passengers on the AI gadgets
hype train is the toothbrush. With claims of using advanced algorithms
and companion apps to help you brush your teeth better, toothbrushes
have become a tech product for some brands.

So-called 'AI toothbrushes' have become more common since debuting in
2017. Numerous brands now market AI capabilities for toothbrushes with
three-figure price tags. But there's limited scientific evidence that
AI algorithms help oral health, and companies are becoming more
interested in using tech-laden toothbrushes to source user data"

Forbes: "Hydrogen Is A Gamechanger For Vertical Flight..  [B]atteries
have 5% of the energy density (per unit volume) of the kerosene-based
fuels used by aircraft, and about 5% of the specific energy (per unit
weight). This means that batteries are 20 times larger and 20 times
heavier than the kerosene fuel used for turbine-powered aircraft [H2
suffers no such problems]...

[O]n July 11, Joby announced that it had converted its second
[battery] aircraft.. to an H2eVTOL demonstrator and completed a
523-mile (842-km) flight on June 24. This.. hydrogen electric
technology demonstrator flew around Marina, California, 'with no
in-flight emissions except water,' the company stated, and landed with
10% of its hydrogen fuel remaining.. this huge leap in capability was
a testament to the potential of hydrogen fuel cell electric
propulsion.

Science Daily: "In a study appearing today in the journal Cell Reports
Physical Science, the researchers show they can produce hydrogen gas
by dropping pretreated, pebble-sized aluminum pellets into a beaker of
filtered seawater. The aluminum is pretreated with a rare-metal alloy
that effectively scrubs aluminum into a pure form that can react with
seawater to generate hydrogen. The salt ions in the seawater can in
turn attract and recover the alloy, which can be reused to generate
more hydrogen, in a sustainable cycle...

The team found that this reaction between aluminum and seawater
successfully produces hydrogen gas, though slowly. On a lark, they
tossed into the mix some coffee grounds and found, to their surprise,
that the reaction picked up its pace"

Monbiot, The Guardian: "Who is brave enough to back Brazil‚Äôs global

have required an annual tax of 12.8%. Trillions, in other words:
enough to address global problems long written off as intractable...

Brazil‚Äôs very modest proposal.. addresses, albeit to a tiny extent,
one of the great democratic deficits of our time: that capital
operates globally, while voting power stops at the national
border. Without global measures, in the contest between people and
plutocrats, the plutocrats will inevitably win..

In the two years following the start of the pandemic, the world‚Äôs
richest 1% captured 63% of economic growth. The collective fortune of
billionaires rose by $2.7bn a day, while some of the world‚Äôs poorest
became poorer still. Between 2020 and 2023, the five richest men on

No ISR is not strategically important for US, by strategy I mean
"long-term decisions that are optimal for one's national
benefit". Many at high levels of government might think they are
acting strategically, that support for Israel is crucial, but that's
because the military/industrial/private complex manuevered the kind of
moron who believes such things into position. In statistical terms
what we see in front of us is a "biased dataset".

---

Israel is not "the tail that wags the dog" they have power because US
plutocrats give them that power. Americans complaining about AIPAC
should give their natives some credit, they are in total control. It
follows if the plutocrats wanted, Israel / Palestine issue would cease
to exist. The whole thing can go away within a day. Fixed. That
includes the "Christian Zionists", who could a U-turn so fast anyone
watching would be flabbergasted, stand in awe how such a supposedly

The Japan Times: "How Germany's hydrogen economy could transform
energy use.. German utility EnBW this week pledged ‚Ç¨1 billion ($1.08
billion) to build pipelines to carry clean hydrogen as part of a plan

2032..Germany is betting on green hydrogen.. For some, it is a gamble;
for others, a world-leading example.

The transport grid is just one element in a strategy that spans 10
gigawatts (GW) of domestic production capacity and an import strategy
that will draw on supply from elsewhere in Europe and overseas. New
gas-to-power generation plants that can switch to hydrogen will be put
to tender by the end of 2024 or early next year.

Industry players in steelmaking and chemicals have plans to replace
coal- and gas-based hydrogen with green hydrogen and utilities are
adding electrolysis and import facilities to their investment
portfolios"

We mentioned the 'axis of evil' issue before.. there is a correlation
between the plane of our solar system and aspects of the CMB. That
should not be possible... The "afterglow of the Big Bang" cannot be
aligned that perfectly with our solar system. If however the CMB
originated from our solar system, due to a measurement error made by
incompetent physicist who thought they were measuring something but
actually measuring something else, the fail can be explained. CMB is
likely nothing but a reflection from Earth's oceans, a local
phenomenon rather than "cosmic". It's sad.

---

The case against the Cosmic Microwave Background itself, a big feature
of Big Bang, is also getting stronger... The universe expansion
(Hubble) constant can be calculated two different ways. One uses CMB,
the other looks at nearby galaxies. Two calculations do not agree. How
could that be? Not possible, unless something went very wrong at the
root of cosmology.

---

Eric Lerner: "The Big Ring contradicts another basic feature of the
Big Bang hypothesis.. and that's what's called the Cosmological
Principle.. [CP] is a very simple assumption, it is the assumption
that the universe at a large enough scale is completely homogeneous
and isotropic. In other words, it has no structure at a large enough
scale, it's smooth like a well-made pudding. This hypothesis is
fundamental to the theoretical basis of the Big Bang hypothesis.

You may have heard incorrectly from some people that General
Relativity predicts that the Big Bang must have happened, that the
universe must be expanding or contracting. That's not true. What is
true is that the equations of General Relativity predict an expanding
or contracting universe if you also assume the cosmological principle
that the universe at a large enough scale is completely homogenous,
the same density at every point, and isotropic, the same density in
every direction..

If there is structure at the scales that are larger than that
predicted by The Big Bang, larger than the scales at which objects
could form in the time since the Big Bang, larger than the scale of
about about half a billion light years, then the cosmological
principle is wrong"

---

Space.com: "An intergalactic ring-shaped superstructure of
galaxies.. so large it defies explanation ‚Äî has been discovered..
Cosmological theory [Big Bang] suggests that the largest structures..

Yet, the circumference of the Big Ring and the length of the
Giant Arc dwarf this constraint"

---

They have to provide some explanation... This is not Chris Evans
playing two different characters.. RDJ started as Stark and only
played that role in the MCU, he is too critical for the universe. The
casting and possible adaptation of 2011 storyline makes sense for
another reason, regular VVD origin story is too tied to Fantastic Four
whose reboot is not out yet, plus it can flop then everything
downstream is screwed. If VVD is tied to Stark's background however,
on an established backdrop, with RDJ's face and acting chops now you
are steaming ahead.

---

How will they explain Doom looks like Stark? A claim is a variation of
a storyline from 2011 will be used, *Demon in An Armor*. Victor Van
Doom tricks Stark into a body swap, Doom becomes CEO of Stark
Industries, looks like TS, but inside he is bad guy Dr Doom.
