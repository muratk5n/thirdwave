# Week 13

Turchin, *End Times*: "The extent to which economic elites dominate
government in the United States is very unusual compared to other
Western democracies. Countries like Denmark and Austria have ruling
classes that have been fairly responsive to the [needs] of their
population. During the postwar period, these countries were ruled by
strong center-left parties, such as social democrats and
socialists. Center-left parties rotated in power with center-right
parties, but a strong consensus for the welfare state was shared
broadly by the ruling elites in Western European
democracies. Countries such as Denmark and Austria usually occupy the
top positions when UN countries are ranked for their ability to
deliver a high quality of life for their citizens... On many
indicators of quality of lifeâ€”life expectancy, equality, educationâ€”the
US is an outlier in the Western world. Why?

[After 1500s] the conditions of intense warfare [via gunpowder,
perfected in Europe] favor[ed] larger, more cohesive states. Small
principalities and city-states could no longer hide behind their
walls, which were easily breached by cannons. Intense military
competition between European states weeded out those that couldnâ€™t
raise large armies; produce muskets and artillery in quantity; and
build expensive modern fortifications that could withstand cannon
fire. The Military Revolution also triggered a revolution in
governance and finance because successful states had to learn how to
efficiently extract and use wealth from their populations... As a
result, medieval militocracies gradually evolved into ruling classes
that combined military and administrative functions.

Although most plutocracies rapidly went extinct, some lingered longer
than others. The Republic of Venice, located on islands protected by
its lagoon, lasted longer than the other Italian city-states... thanks
to its protected position in the British Isles, once England conquered
all of them, it could, and did, dispense with the standing army (at
least within England itself). The squirearchy, which started as a
military class, gradually lost its military character and became
simply a class of landowners, from which members of the British
Parliament were elected... Unlike the other European great powers,
which had to direct most of their resources into land armies or be
conquered, the British Empire poured its resources into its navy. As a
result, the United Kingdom came to be ruled by an elite that combined
economic and administrative functions.

The antebellum ruling class in the US was a direct offshoot of the
English squirearchy. Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia were settled
by the Cavaliers, the faction of supporters of Charles I that lost the
English Civil War. They brought with them their aristocratic ways and
indentured servants.  The latter were soon replaced by imported
Africans, enslaved for life. After they won the Revolutionary War
against the British Empire, the winners set about building their own
state. Southern planters and Northern merchants largely copied the
cultural forms of governance with which they were familiar. The early
American Republic was an oligarchy modeled after the United Kingdom,
although without a monarch (who, by that point, was on the way to
becoming just a figurehead in the British Empire anyway). As a result,
the United States inherited plutocracy as part of its 'cultural
genotype'"

It is not correct to compare US with the Romans. US is not an empire.
The Roman Empire was a militocracy, US is a plutocracy.

In America's rush to build the #nuclear arsenal that won the Cold War,
\#safety was sacrificed for speed.

In 2022, we cataloged cleanup efforts at the sites where #uranium was
processed to fuel this arsenal.

At least 84% of these sites have polluted #groundwater"

Four years ago today my kid's school shut down and I coped by making a
list of cities that were closing streets to cars so kids could play in
them.

Shortly thereafter, I took to social media for help documenting what
would soon be a global phenomenon.

It was a hell of a ride..

That initial post led to

1. a global database of street space changes with entries from over 1,500 cities, 

2. multiple new and rekindled collaborations with brilliant people around the world, 

3. some very cool papers (by me and others), and

4. a new job"

Maybe the complex / globalists sent a message to their opposition via
SCP. They said "watch your step biznatches!"

It would be fitting the medium for the message is a cargo ship.

The ship destroying that bridge was managed by Synergy Marine Group.
New York-based private equity firm Searchlight Capital Partners
acquired it on 2022. Searchlight also recently bought a controlling
share in Israel's largest telecom group, Bezeq.

The Canary: "Palestine Action has once again shown the power of direct
action â€“ by shutting down another UK weapons factory. Meanwhile,
activists in the US have stepped up their campaign, also shutting an
arms company facility down. The company in question is of course Elbit
â€“ and its complicity in Israelâ€˜s genocide continues"

The largest software project ever undertaken by mankind, the Linux
kernel, was developed under GPL license btw, not commercially.

Luke Smith: "Why I Use the GPL and Not Cuck Licenses.. Every piece of
software I write I license under the GNU Public License Version 3
(GPLv3) unless I have forked it from something else. The GPLv3 is the
premiere copyleft license, meaning that it not only allows users to
run, modify and distribute their own versions of what I write, but it
also requires that no one in that chain of development restrict and
close-source that software"

"James Weldon Johnson boarded a.. steamship.. on February 27, 1920,
tasked by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People to investigate conditions in Haiti under US military rule..
[he] published his findings in the Nation as the four-part report
*Self-Determining Haiti* [where] Johnsonâ€™s assessment of the US
occupation (1915â€“1934), by then in its fifth year, was searing..

For Johnson a single institution and a single individual were
responsible for the US intervention: the National City Bank of New
York - the precursor to the contemporary financial services leviathan
Citigroup - and its vice president Roger Leslie Farnham... [he wrote]

>[T]o understand why the United States landed and has for five years
>maintained military forces in that country, why some three thousand
>Haitian men, women, and children have been shot down by American
>rifles and machine guns, it is necessary, among other things, to know
>that the National City Bank of New York is very much interested in
>Haiti. It is necessary to know that the National City Bank controls
>the National Bank of Haiti and is the depository for all of the
>Haitian national funds that are being collected by American
>officials, and that Mr. R. L. Farnham, vice-president of the National
>City Bank, is virtually the representative of the State Department in
>matters relating to the island republic"

It is fitting the most famous anti-American novel *Shibumi* has
its villain personified in a corporation. Mother Company? Who was its
CEO, per an insider joke of that universe, "Ma". CEO was picked as
female I guess the subtle message was even the caring, nurturing
streotype of the female could turn into a money-grubbing conniving
bitch if the scenery is global transnational capitalism.

Ha. *Billions* S7 made a reference to the novel *Shibumi*.

*Evil Geniuses*: "[I]n the early 2000s the Kochs and big business kept
expanding what they'd begun in the 1970s and '80s, giving more money
to the think tanks and nonprofits and Washington lobbyists promoting
their other political economic interests. The Kochs started holding
biannual meetings of their new confederacy of right-wing billionaire
political donors, the active core of whom had made their fortunes in
fossil fuels and finance. A new national right-wing financial
organization called DonorsTrust enabled donors to remain anonymous and
keep their fingerprints off their $1.1 billion in contributions (so
far) to hundreds of groups dedicated to 'advancing liberty'..

In 1980, David Koch ran for vice president to Reagan's right on the
Libertarian platform that then seemed crazily extreme 'abolish the EPA
and OSHA, privatize Social Security, repeal campaign finance laws' and
his brother Charles worried about the reaction if the general public
were to learn of their 'radically different' views. But a generation
later in the mid-1990s, what had once been beyond the fringe was the
mass-marketable conservative mainstream. The Kochian economic right
had become a tight-knit shadow national political party affiliated
with and dominating the nominally independent GOP"
