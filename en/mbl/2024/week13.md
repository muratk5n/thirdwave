# Week 13

The largest software project ever undertaken by mankind, the Linux
kernel, was developed under GPL license btw, not commercially.

Luke Smith: "Why I Use the GPL and Not Cuck Licenses.. Every piece of
software I write I license under the GNU Public License Version 3
(GPLv3) unless I have forked it from something else. The GPLv3 is the
premiere copyleft license, meaning that it not only allows users to
run, modify and distribute their own versions of what I write, but it
also requires that no one in that chain of development restrict and
close-source that software"

"James Weldon Johnson boarded a.. steamship.. on February 27, 1920,
tasked by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People to investigate conditions in Haiti under US military rule..
[he] published his findings in the Nation as the four-part report
*Self-Determining Haiti* [where] Johnson’s assessment of the US
occupation (1915–1934), by then in its fifth year, was searing..

For Johnson a single institution and a single individual were
responsible for the US intervention: the National City Bank of New
York - the precursor to the contemporary financial services leviathan
Citigroup - and its vice president Roger Leslie Farnham... [he wrote]

>[T]o understand why the United States landed and has for five years
>maintained military forces in that country, why some three thousand
>Haitian men, women, and children have been shot down by American
>rifles and machine guns, it is necessary, among other things, to know
>that the National City Bank of New York is very much interested in
>Haiti. It is necessary to know that the National City Bank controls
>the National Bank of Haiti and is the depository for all of the
>Haitian national funds that are being collected by American
>officials, and that Mr. R. L. Farnham, vice-president of the National
>City Bank, is virtually the representative of the State Department in
>matters relating to the island republic"

It is fitting the most famous anti-American novel *Shibumi* has
its villain personified in a corporation. Mother Company? Who was its
CEO, per an insider joke of that universe, "Ma". CEO was picked as
female I guess the subtle message was even the caring, nurturing
streotype of the female could turn into a money-grubbing conniving
bitch if the scenery is global transnational capitalism.

Ha. *Billions* S7 made a reference to the novel *Shibumi*.

*Evil Geniuses*: "[I]n the early 2000s the Kochs and big business kept
expanding what they'd begun in the 1970s and '80s, giving more money
to the think tanks and nonprofits and Washington lobbyists promoting
their other political economic interests. The Kochs started holding
biannual meetings of their new confederacy of right-wing billionaire
political donors, the active core of whom had made their fortunes in
fossil fuels and finance. A new national right-wing financial
organization called DonorsTrust enabled donors to remain anonymous and
keep their fingerprints off their $1.1 billion in contributions (so
far) to hundreds of groups dedicated to 'advancing liberty'..

In 1980, David Koch ran for vice president to Reagan's right on the
Libertarian platform that then seemed crazily extreme 'abolish the EPA
and OSHA, privatize Social Security, repeal campaign finance laws' and
his brother Charles worried about the reaction if the general public
were to learn of their 'radically different' views. But a generation
later in the mid-1990s, what had once been beyond the fringe was the
mass-marketable conservative mainstream. The Kochian economic right
had become a tight-knit shadow national political party affiliated
with and dominating the nominally independent GOP"
