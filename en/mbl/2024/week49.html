<p>"Back in the bad old days, the story goes, antitrust policy was
relatively divorced from economic reasoning. Bigness was a problem,
not primarily because of its effects on the economy but because of its
effects on society. The key figure here is Supreme Court Justice Louis
Brandeis, whose 1914 essay “The Curse of Bigness” expressed concern
about the effect of size not just on smaller competitors and prices,
but on the healthy function of a democratic republic...</p>
<p>Then, in the late 1970s, the clouds parted, and Robert Bork descended
from the Heavens. Bork’s 1978 book <em>The Antitrust Paradox</em> led
scholars and practitioners alike..  embrace a new vision of antitrust
based on the standard of consumer welfare. He and his colleagues in
the Chicago school of antitrust argued that the alleged.. [h]ighly
concentrated markets were often a byproduct of economies of scale, not
anticompetitive practices. But if bigness doesn’t necessarily make
consumers worse off, then bigness as such isn’t really the
problem. Antitrust policy, according to Chicago, should target only
behaviors that actually reduce consumer welfare, and otherwise leave
the market alone.</p>
<p>The Chicago view was profoundly influential on American antitrust
law. Bork’s book was cited approvingly by the Supreme Court almost
immediately after it came out, and the consumer welfare standard is
still the dominant consideration in antitrust law today. As a result,
government started to take a much more laissez-faire approach to
mergers and acquisitions than it had for most of the twentieth
century....</p>
<p>[But concentration was causing problems everywhere] the poultry
industry is dominated by just a handful of processing companies. This
means that farmers are often in a 'take it or leave it' situation with
respect to the processors, on whom they depend for their
livelihood. About a decade ago, the federal government was running a
series of listening sessions to learn more about problems faced by
farmers in the industry. But many of the chicken farmers simply didn’t
show up. The reason? The processors had threatened to retaliate
against them if they did, and that was a risk they simply couldn’t
afford to take. The processing companies were using their market power
to silence workers, effectively undermining both their freedom of
speech and their ability to improve their working conditions"</p>
