# Week 38

H2 Europe: "German asset manager KGAL has invested an undisclosed
amount into a proposed green hydrogen project with up to 1,050MW of
electrolyser capacity in the municipality of Lubmin, on Germany’s
northeastern coast. The plant’s developers, GP Joule and PtX
Development — the latter of which has already secured a site — plan to
initially install 210MW of electrolysers in the first phase, although
a timeline for scale-up to more than 1GW of capacity has not been
disclosed"

H2 Central: "Uruguay readies offshore wind licence for green hydrogen
production.. Uruguay’s state-owned energy company Ancap may soon grant
concessions on four offshore blocks to produce green hydrogen as the
country seeks to position itself as a 'global exporter'"

Officially I'll stick to the original prediction... I'm using polling
data to gauge a lower bound on Dem campaigning, meh, not terrible so
far. Combined, let's still say Kamaller, I'll eat crow if it goes the
other way.

---

If we negate the incumb adv for Dems, their chance for win is,

```
Interval: [42.95 50.51] Average: 46.73
```

Most likely a loss.

---

Should Trump be seen as an incumbent? He did not get his chance for a
second term, he is running for that now, just like an incumbent
would. Since 2020 was such a confusing time, a chaos, squint a little,
it could look like two incumbents are running against each other. That
would change the outcome of the Abramovitz formula.

---

Theory of Everything attempts keep falling short bcz the previous
layer(s) have faults. We should not delude ourselves thinking the WWI
generation had everything figured out. Yankee sci culture is too
insecure to go there, US led sci consensus keeps trying to maintain
the foundational layer and somehow "connect stuff on top" and have
their grand theory. Everything is a f-ing mess and this modern
consensus is to blame. Just look at international relations and
project that onto science. Same dipshittery everywhere, with the same
sad result.

---

Good point by Marmet.. you can come up with eqns that fit the data,
but are those the right equations that explain the reality that
produce that data?

---

Einstein was wrong

---

Paul Marmet: "Many experiments, like the Michelson-Morley and Sagnac
experiments and others, are testing the fundamental nature of
light. It is conflicting to observe that the velocity of photons is
measured as a constant, when the observer moves away from that light
source. Since all other particles are measured with additive
velocities ($V-v$) or ($V+v$) with respect to a moving frame, why can
photons not obey that same rule?  Since Newton's mechanics has shown
that all relative velocities produce a Doppler frequency shift, we
must expect that some special phenomena prevent us from detecting the
real change of relative velocity. It is quite incorrect to believe
that this phenomenon cannot be explained using physical reality and
Newton physics.  As required by the principle of mass-energy
conservation, the atoms (nucleus and electrons) forming the local
standard reference meter and the moving clock have acquired some extra
mass due to the materialization of kinetic energy. Quantum mechanics
shows that this increase of energy changes the de Broglie electron
wavelength and consequently, the Bohr radius and the clock rate. It is
surprising to find new hypotheses like space-time distortion, and even
more, the suggestion of 'new logic' to explain these observations,
while it is not taken into account that the rate of the moving clock
is naturally modified due to the increase of mass (following the
absorption of kinetic energy). The simple application of the principle
of mass-energy conservation explains naturally all these experiments..
We must recall that an empirical equation used to predict the outcome
of a physical system is *not an explanation*"

Puerto Rico was clearly invaded by US corporate power..

Kinzer, *Overthrow, US' Century of Regime Change*: "During the early
years of the twentieth century, four American corporations gobbled up
most of Puerto Rico's best land. On it they planted sugar, a crop
suited to large-scale farming. The big losers were families who grew
coffee, which is known as the 'poor man's crop' because it can be
cultivated on small plots. By 1930, sugar accounted for 60 percent of
the country's exports, while coffee, once the island's principal crop,
had fallen to just 1 percent... With little access to land, ordinary
Puerto Ricans became steadily poorer. One study found that while 17
percent of them were unemployed at the time of the American invasion,
30 percent were unemployed a quarter century later"

MCU did not know how to handle Thor, he was like a hot potato for
them. Thor's Asgard culture is a militocracy, the first excellent
movie shows it in its glory. The movie did great. But then mind
manipulators had to bring Thor down a notch. He was made fat, cucked,
made fool of, in multiple movies. They even had the warrior girl
pining for him lose interest and cuck others. It was a chain
cuck. Then Asgard was destroyed. Hemsworth is a good sport, he rolled
with it all, still coming out looking good, but Marv certainly
tried. If Thor was a budding businessman, an enterpreneur, even better
anti-government enterpreneur, he would be great, he would never be
cucked.

It is possible Disney MCU will use Doom as the symbol of a leader
inspired by a militocracy, representing the "Old World" (per origin,
VVD is even from there), and they might want to have him killed by a
character they want to build up. An anti-government businessman
perhaps? Which character would that be? Maybe they'll have a Stark
variant who is anti-government, never divested from weapon sales,
remained a regular MIC scum, he would get to kill Doom.

We need to note Napoleon was a *military* leader in the mold of other
military leaders in Europe. As Turchin says "medieval militocracies
gradually evolved into ruling classes that combined military and
administrative functions". He was not a *plutocrat*, did not
descend from a culture thinking of "bottom lines", "maximizing
profits" in that by following these precepts blindly benefits would
come to society, flowers would bloom and cows would fly. We see what
is happening to places that inherit their admin from those, basically
the Anglo-land who are currently in a process of quite implosion.

Napoleon achieved a lot in gov management, he was also extremely
supportive of the sciences and engineering.

Wiki: "The Napoleonic Code (French: Code Napoléon).. is the French
civil code established during the French Consulate in 1804 and still

patchwork of feudal laws. Historian Robert Holtman regards it as one
of the few documents that have influenced the whole world"

Republicans pre-Trump would absolutely support that bill, after a faux

Bidness interests want those ppl around, not to leave the country when
they lose their job so are part of a giant unemployed pool suppressing

not bidness, or contribute to large gov debt which they don't give a

Kuznick, *The Untold History of the US*: "Although U.S. involvement in
the First World War had been relatively brief and, by most measures,
enormously successful, the nature of the fighting, marked by trench
and chemical warfare, and the shaky postwar settlement combined to
undermine the glory of the war itself. In its aftermath, Americans
became increasingly disillusioned. A war fought to make the world safe
for democracy seemed to have failed in its purpose. Nor was there much
hope that this war would end all wars. Though some people nevertheless
clung to the belief that the United States had engaged in a great
crusade for freedom and democracy, for others the phrase rang
hollow. A postwar literature of disillusionment emerged in the works
of E. E. Cummings, John Dos Passos, Ernest Hemingway, Ezra Pound,
Thomas Boyd, William Faulkner, Laurence Stallings, Irwin Shaw, Ford
Madox Ford, Dalton Trumbo, and other writers as the nation learned
once again that the initial euphoria of war would be erased by the
reality of what the war actually achieved"

During covid money was printed and given to people. What happened
later? It ended up with big corp, inequality increased, meaning the
wealthy will still buy your assets, own your debt, charge you rent,
and give you crums to live by. Any new "theory" needs to put taxing
front in center, not create bizarre drama around
printing-or-not-printing, should-I-shouldnt-I-print. MMT is a waste of
time, just like battery electric cars are for climate change.

---

MMT is the tail-end, fringe part of the neolib strategy. The grand
narrative is being for "sound money" while printing it for the
rich. Media already works for them, opposition is silenced. Once in a
while though they throw the oppo a bone, via MMT this time "you could
print until you see inflation, you know", wink wink, an approach that
will never become policy, but it gives the fools hope, keeps them
occupied. That way noone talks about taxing the rich.

---

"Print until you see inflation" is not policy, it is bad analysis. MMT
is a ruse to divert attn from taxing the rich.

---

The spectre haunting the West is not communism, nor far-right
extremism (which is a symptom rather than the cause). The problem is
neolib "centrism", that opresses left-wing solutions to impose its
order, constantly creates unnecessary wars at home and
abroad. Neoliberal centrism will create econ pain and that will
eventually give rise to right-wing extremism just like when it did in
post WWI Germany.

Like thats right

TDB: "A gunman crawled through shrubbery near Donald Trump’s golf
course in West Palm Beach, Florida, Sunday afternoon, coming within
500 yards of the former president, authorities said. Ryan Wesley
Routh, 58, was hiding with the barrel of his AK-47-style rifle poking
through a fence when it was spotted by a Secret Service agent.. “With
a rifle and scope, like, that is not a long distance,” Palm Beach
County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said at a news conference Sunday
afternoon"

Kursk incursion reversal is happening as fast as it advanced. That
makes sense bcz the speed of the advance had to do with the geographic
character of the place and same is true of the reversion. The areas
captured by UA were sparsely populated, not fortifed (unlike Donbas)
so Ukraine seemingly gained lots of territory, incredibly fast. Now it
is losing them as fast as they were gained. Easy come, easy go.

Wars can be fought within democracies.. But recent events outed a
dirty little secret, Ukraine has never been a democracy, in large part
thanks to the Americans.

Zelensk term ran out months ago. New elections have to be called if
the current gov can remain legitimate. Where are they? Aren't we
defending democracy? Apparently there isn't any in Ukraine!

Fleming: "There are four.. observations, which are considered to be
proofs of General Relativity.. The first is the change in the time
rate of clocks in a gravitational field, the second is gravitational
redshift, the third is the Shapiro Delay, and the fourth is the
bending of light...

[Bending of light] has never been an issue of space contraction, but
rather the speed of light being reduced near bodies of matter. This is
the same conclusion, the speed of light changing, reached by Paul
Marmet who did an excellent job cataloging the difficulties involved
with measuring the Shapiro Delay and the bending of light... The
Shapiro Delay is due to the reduction in light velocity due to photon
deceleration/acceleration and increased London-van der Waals
torque.. Gravitational redshift is due to a decrease in energy as a
photon accelerates away from a star.. The final piece of the frame
transformation puzzle is the time rate change of clocks... this
phenomenon is not a time dilation of space, but simply a change in
clock rate due to the kinetic energy due to the velocity of a physical
clock relative to the universal rest frame"

There is no money? Instead of raising the ret age and underfinancing

F24: "French teachers are quitting in record numbers, overwhelmed by
low pay, crowded classrooms and increasing demands."

RU did not divert mil resources from Donbas, did not bother the op
there. According to news the governor of Tula was given the job to
stop the incursion in Kursk.

---

Kursk incursion is being rolled back. Massive gains in the East.
