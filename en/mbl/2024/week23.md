# Week 23

Yann LeCun: "Nice [article](https://www.ft.com/content/23fab126-f1d3-4add-a457-207a25730ad9)
in Financial Time where I explain that Auto-Regressive LLM are insufficient
to reach human-level intelligence (or even cat-level intelligence).

But alternative architectures that I call 'objective driven' may reach
human-level intelligence one day.

They use world models based on JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive
Architectures, which are not generative).

With this, we may have systems that 

1. understand the physical world

2. have persistent memory

3. can reason

4. can plan, perhaps hierarchically.

Four essential characteristics necessary for intelligent behavior,
which humans and many animals exhibit"

The Guardian: "Future Made in Australia: $23bn for ‘biggest
transformation’.. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said in his budget
speech on Tuesday night that the global economy was facing its biggest
transformation since the Industrial Revolution... 'Australian energy
can power it, Australian resources can build it, Australia’s regions
can drive it, Australian researchers can shape it and Australian
workers can thrive in it,' Chalmers told parliament... This includes
tax incentives for the production of hydrogen and critical minerals
from 2027-28. There will be a further 1.3bn for another round of the
hydrogen headstart program to boost 'early-mover renewable hydrogen
projects'.

Philips: "In the 1980s, conservative tax-cut theorists and market
utopians would call for the reenactment of the twenties as an economic
triumph botched only by government mishandling, but their grandfathers
knew better. Even the Republican Congress of 1929 was part of a wall
of worry. In February the Senate had passed a resolution asking the
Federal Reserve to provide advice should legislation become necessary
to curb speculation.. During the disenchanted 1930s, a citizenry
digging out from the debris of broken promises and shattered
assumptions would rally round a president ready to point a finger of
blame. The 1920s' admiration for wealth would become 1930s' distrust"

That makes sense; improving infra will cheapen H2 massively, producing
it is not a huge deal. We need to defund the grid, pay less attention
to electrification, and direct all efforts to clean gas based
distribution and storage.

Energypost.eu: "Researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory in 2019
determined that hydrogen production costs account for just 15% of the
final cost 'at the dispenser' for hydrogen used in
transportation.. The remaining – or 'hidden' – 85% of hydrogen costs
often get overlooked.. On a cost per kilogram basis, just 15% of this
cost is due to production (~$2/kg). Roughly 50% of the hydrogen cost
is from the station (equipment like compressors and on-site storage)
and 35% is from distribution. This means a staggering 85% of the final
cost of hydrogen is due to factors beyond production"

Politico: "If you really want to understand Trump’s appeal.. you need
to wind back the tape to the 1984 Democratic primary, the
almost-pulled-it-off candidacy of Colorado Senator Gary Hart and the
emerging yuppie demographic that made up his base. They don’t remotely
resemble the working-class base we associate with Trump today. But
together, they helped shift the Democratic Party’s focus away from its
labor coalition and toward the hyper-educated liberal voters it
largely represents today, eventually creating an opening for Trump to
cast Democrats as out-of-touch elites and draw the white working class
away from them. In fact, if it weren’t for 1980s yuppies and the way
they shifted America’s political parties, the modern MAGA GOP might
never have arisen in the first place..

[After Reagan, Dems decided to go] harder in the direction that Gary
Hart — and yuppies — had pointed them.. In 1992, that faction of the
party got its wish with the nomination and election of Bill Clinton,
not only a centrist but a Yale- and Oxford-educated baby boomer — the
first yuppie president. In office, Clinton pursued an agenda that
largely put the desires of college-educated professionals above those
of the blue-collar working class. He signed welfare reform and
announced the era of big government was over. He championed NAFTA,
which made it easier to ship manufacturing jobs to Mexico. He
deregulated the financial industry, boosting the power and profits of
Wall Street"

Philips: "[2002 W]hen I published *The Politics of Rich and Poor*,
some of its success was owed to the two lead endorsements on the back
of the book jacket. One was from New York Governor Mario Cuomo, then
widely expected to be the 1992 Democratic presidential nominee. The
second was from former President Richard Nixon, who gave it with full
knowledge that the book was critical of the Reagan and Bush
administrations for favoring the rich. Nixon’s streetcar-worker father
had left Ohio for California after getting a name as labor agitator,
and he thereafter interrupted his McKinley Republicanism to support
third-party progressives like Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and Robert La
Follette in 1924. As president, Nixon himself supported national
health insurance, income maintenance for the poor, and higher taxation
of unearned than earned income. The 1972 Republican platform actually
criticized multinational corporations for building plants overseas to
take advantage of cheap labor"

The Atlantic: "AI travel plans leave something to be desired. When I
told ChatGPT that I was a 'huge foodie' and asked it to adjust an
L.A. itinerary accordingly, it suggested I go to a Michelin-starred
restaurant for dinner. It didn’t say which one. It just told me that
L.A. had some and that, if I liked food, I should go to one. That’s
sort of like telling a person who likes music that maybe they’d be
into a Grammy-winning artist and leaving it at that...

[A] team of researchers at Fudan University in Shanghai, Ohio State
University, Penn State, and Meta came to a similar conclusion. They
tested chatbots on 1,000 sample queries, such as 'Please create a
travel itinerary for a solo traveler departing from Jacksonville and
heading to Los Angeles for a period of 3 days, from March 25th to
March 27th, 2022. The budget for this trip is now set at $2,400.' They
then evaluated whether the chatbots were able to provide answers that
met all the criteria in the prompt. The chatbots pretty much failed
across the board. [Even the best] successfully answered only six
queries out of 1,000, or 0.6 percent. The chatbots failed for a
variety of factors: They made reasoning errors, and sometimes made
stuff up"

NPU means Neural Processing Unit, so the machine runs "AI" locally,

either. LLMs are useless for any serious real-world need.

Stanford: "Vaporware: One practice that has been associated with
Microsoft, and has subsequently been investigated by the Department of
Justice, is Microsoft's practice of releasing 'vaporware'. Vaporware
is considered an unfair marketing technique - it often allows a
company that already has considerable market share in one area to
claim similar market share in another area without even distributing a
product. The enthusiasm for the anticipated release of the product is
often enough to squelch any market competition, even though there is
no product to compete"

In a historic first for Europe, green hydrogen producer Lhyfe has
signed a memorandum of understanding with major stainless steel
company Ugitech to create a green hydrogen production facility at
Ugitech's plant in the French Alps.

This pioneering partnership aims to replace dirty pollution with clean
hydrogen in steel manufacturing, according to Renewable Energy
Magazine.

<img width='340' src='https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image-276.jpg?w=340'/> 

Under the agreement, Lhyfe will install a green hydrogen production
unit capable of generating around 13 tons per day at Ugitech's site in
Ugine, France. The locally produced hydrogen will power the steel
plant's furnaces and heating equipment, with excess supply made
available to fuel clean transportation in the region.

The private, revolving-door military-industrial-donor-complex has it

in 1995 (Clinton admin), canceled after $7 billion, they delivered
nothing. Zilch. The military leaders pushing such systems are
promoted, not punished, and likely moved on to cushy private sector
jobs. The corporate press saw none of this as they were heavily
focused on more pressing issues such as "gays in the military".

Israel is needed for the private complex; their very presence is the
instigator of chaos, and chaos = profits. The shit stirred up in Syria
alone (an Israel enemy) was a massive moneymaker for the MIC, and it's
not just about weapons sent to Israel. Israel can sell US military
equipment, with US' knowledge, to countries to which the U.S. is
restricted by law from selling, they act as the middleman. A vast
military deployment is possible / is justified by Israel's presence
and US' "protection" of it.

Just like Israel is not 'the tail wagging the dog' when it comes to US
foreign policy, Russiagate was not completely abt helping Dems save
face for their disastrous 2016 loss either. Russiagate was a suitable
line of attack precisely bcz it forced the Trump admin to be colder
towards Russia. With all the "Putin puppet" talk going on the new
admin had to act hawkish against them, and this was RG's key
feature. As far as the military-industrial-complex, revolving-door
private-owned surface-state is concerned, if Russia cannot be
plundered by American oligarchs, they have to be villified, so NATO is
always front in center in the relation and MIC can sell weapons within
its specs. Russiagate performed this function brilliantly as well as
checking other boxes, blaming a foreign power so econ ineq is not
discussed, attempting to salvage the Clinton legacy (who is the prime
shitlib, econ-right social-left extraordinaire, fake left, poser, and
a dumbass).
