<p>Reuters: "Britain's national gas network is ready to accommodate
hydrogen as a fuel to power homes and industry, a report based on a
trial carried out by National Gas showed on Wednesday.. The trial
tested the blending of hydrogen into previously operational assets
from the national transmission network over the last 12 months,
scaling from a 2% blend of hydrogen with natural gas up to 100%.</p>
<p>A report based on the trial's findings showed there were 'no issues'
during the first phase of the project and no major obstacles to
repurposing the network for hydrogen. The project has now moved into
its second phase, which will look into the challenges associated with
the compression of hydrogen using existing assets – including
demonstrating the potential to repurpose gas turbines for hydrogen use
at compressor stations"</p>

<p>ZDNet: "Switzerland has taken a major step forward with its 'Federal
Law on the Use of Electronic Means for the Fulfillment of Government

open-source software (OSS) in the public sector.. Making this move
wasn't easy. It began in 2011 when the Swiss Federal Supreme Court
published its court application, Open Justitia, under an OSS
license. The proprietary legal software company Weblaw wasn't happy
about this. There were heated political and legal fights for more than
a decade. Finally, the EMBAG was passed in 2023. Now, the law not only
allows the release of OSS by the Swiss government or its contractors,
but also requires the code to be released under an open-source
license"</p>

cannot interpret laboratory results, thus posing a serious risk to the
health of patients. Furthermore, we move beyond diagnostic accuracy
and demonstrate that they cannot be easily integrated into existing
workflows because they often fail to follow instructions and are
sensitive to both the quantity and order of information. Overall, our
analysis reveals that LLMs are currently not ready for autonomous

<p>Amb. Chas Freeman: "The world does not share the Biden administration’s
insistent conjecture that history is culminating in a great battle
between democracy and autocracy. America’s obsession with democratic
ideology arises not from foreign efforts to subvert constitutional
democracy in the United States but from internal factors that are
eroding democracy and the rule of law domestically. Constitutional
democracy can only be built and sustained at home. It cannot be
dismantled by foreign refusal to emulate it.</p>
<p>The prerequisites for constitutional democracy include the combination
of the rule of law with freedom of speech. This Western-invented
composite has historically enabled debate among an informed citizenry
so that they can advise and consent to government rulemaking.  If the
United States is becoming less constitutionalist and more
authoritarian, as it is, this is disturbing to those who, like me,
treasure the values of the European Enlightenment, but it is the
result of decisions made by Americans, not manipulation by China,
Russia, or any other foreign power..</p>
<p>Given the historical U.S. role in promoting international law, the
'rules-based order' now promoted by Washington is a modern version of
'rule <strong>by</strong> law [emphasis mine]'..  It supposes that the United
States – or the United States plus the club of former imperialist
powers called the 'G7' – can make the rules, alter them at will,
exempt themselves from them, and determine to whom else they do or do
not apply.  This system is rejected as illegitimate by the global
majority, which much prefers one based on the United Nations Charter
and the decisions of the international community.</p>

<p>What happens to the Time for Change prediction now? All parameters
remain the same, the incumbent's popularity will transfer to Kamala,
she'll be judged by Biden's -20%, also inherits the (party first term)
incumbency advantage. FED GDP Now predicts 2.7% GDP growth for Q2,
which is good for Dems. The formula shows an advantage for Democrats.</p>
<p>The issue for me post-debate was the possibility of a Gore/Bush style
race, where all parameters were in Dem favor but Gore team as we
remember ran the worst campaign in modern history and W ran the best,
iow campaigning tilted the balance, factors outside the formula. If
Kamala wins the nomination painlessly, there is no chaos, and Kamala's
team (including some of Biden's operators surely who are pretty good)
equals Trump's, then campaigning of both sides neutralize and the
Democrats will come out on top.</p>

<hr />
<p>Bernie from yesterdays CBS News interview: "[Biden] was the only
president in American history to actually stand on a picket line
during a strike with workers, and has been very pro-worker in terms of
raising the minimum wage, supporting the Pro-Act, which makes it
easier for workers to join unions appointing a very good Secretary of
Labor..</p>
<p>[But] we have, at a time of massive income inequality, 600,000 people
sleeping out on the streets.. Despite spending twice as much on
healthcare is the people of the other country, you have 85 million
people uninsured or underinsured. 60,000 people die every year because
they can afford to get to a doctor".</p>
<p>He is talking about the uninsured? Didn't f-ing Obamacare fix all
that? Of course it didn't. Everyone knows it, including Harris too imo
who might put the issue on the platform, I heard one mention already,
and during 2020 primary she did try to advocate for Medicare for All
but was talked out of it by her staff, likely due to fear the issue
would not "play well" with the Dem the centrist wing.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is much left to be done, on the Dem left-wing front. Bernie had
a seat at the table, so he criticized less w/ JB. But now that the
boss is on the way out, Bernie speaks his mind more.</p>

<p>I just got a copyright claim against a video I posted on youtube 10
years ago.</p>
<p>The video is a film by Georges Melies that was shot in the 1890s.</p>
<p>Someone is attempting to claim copyright over a film that is 130 years
old, who's director died 86 years ago.</p>
<p>Now 1) I don't give a shit about this clip on youtube. 2) The person
who made this claim is clearly in the wrong. 3) I can't be the only
one that they have targeted illegally"</p>

<p>Reuters: "Spain to launch new $2.5 billion plan to support green
hydrogen, renewable industry"</p>

<p>ABC News: "California will be the first state to receive federal funds
under a program to create regional networks, or “hubs,” that produce
hydrogen as an energy source for vehicles, manufacturing and
generating electricity, officials announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy said the California Hydrogen Hub will
receive an initial $30 million to begin its planning and design
phase. The state will eventually receive up to 1.2 billion for the
project that is a key part of the Biden administration's agenda to
slow climate change.</p>
<p>The administration in October selected seven regional hubs for the $7
billion program that will kickstart development and production of
hydrogen fuel, with the goal of eventually replacing fossil fuels such
as coal and oil with the colorless, odorless gas that already powers
some cars and trains"</p>

<p>I collected many online radio sources operating at 32 kbps, pretty low
transmission but good enough. Listen to hours of the stuff at 32 kbps
the net bill is still low. </p>
