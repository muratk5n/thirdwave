public sector can reduce vendor lock-in, companies can grow their
digital business solutions, and taxpayers spend less on IT solutions

innovation' [says an expert St√ºrmer who] has been a pivotal advocate
for this change. With a background in digital sustainability and open

the <em>other</em> party that is not yours, just to poke you in the eye.

<p>Politico: "Biden‚Äôs exit blows a hole in the political rise of
ambitious Democrats.. Things just got a whole lot more complicated for
2028 hopefuls. Democrats have no shortage of rising stars who were
just four years away from a potential run for the White House. Now
they are faced with an urgent question: Do they throw their hat into
the ring now.. or do they rally around Vice President Kamala Harris ‚Äî
holding out for their moment, even if it could now take eight more
years?.. Though many serious challengers appear to be standing down,
it‚Äôs unclear if all of them will. There have been murmurs in recent
weeks about a number of top Democratic governors"</p>
<hr />
<p>A new negative now is that Democrats started to look like the party of
chaos. Reps will sling trouble from every which direction, "if Biden
does not run again, is he fit to be President?", "can the existing
campaign cash used by Kamala [if nominated]?"..</p>

nominee without competition, voters may feel disenfranchised again"</p>

nomination in her statement ‚Äî an acknowledgment that a competition,
not a coronation, puts her in the best position going into the general

<p>The Guardian: "Signs of two gases in clouds of Venus could indicate

Earth ‚Äì and potentially just about survivable for very hardy
microbes.. On Earth, phosphine gas is produced by microbes in
oxygen-starved environments..</p>
<p>'Our findings suggest that when the atmosphere is bathed in sunlight
the phosphine is destroyed,' [physicist] Clements said. 'All that we
can say is that phosphine is there. We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs producing
it. It may be chemistry that we don‚Äôt understand. Or possibly life'"</p>

<p>Reuters: "Spain to launch new $2.5 billion plan to support green

<hr />
<p>ABC News: "California will be the first state to receive federal funds
under a program to create regional networks, or ‚Äúhubs,‚Äù that produce
hydrogen as an energy source for vehicles, manufacturing and
generating electricity, officials announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Energy said the California Hydrogen Hub will
receive an initial $30 million to begin its planning and design
phase. The state will eventually receive up to 1.2 billion for the
project that is a key part of the Biden administration's agenda to
slow climate change.</p>
<p>The administration in October selected seven regional hubs for the $7
billion program that will kickstart development and production of
hydrogen fuel, with the goal of eventually replacing fossil fuels such
as coal and oil with the colorless, odorless gas that already powers
some cars and trains"</p>
