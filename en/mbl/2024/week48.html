<p>"Back in the bad old days, the story goes, antitrust policy was
relatively divorced from economic reasoning. Bigness was a problem,
not primarily because of its effects on the economy but because of its
effects on society. The key figure here is Supreme Court Justice Louis
Brandeis, whose 1914 essay “The Curse of Bigness” expressed concern
about the effect of size not just on smaller competitors and prices,
but on the healthy function of a democratic republic...</p>
<p>Then, in the late 1970s, the clouds parted, and Robert Bork descended
from the Heavens. Bork’s 1978 book <em>The Antitrust Paradox</em> led
scholars and practitioners alike..  embrace a new vision of antitrust
based on the standard of consumer welfare. He and his colleagues in
the Chicago school of antitrust argued that the alleged.. [h]ighly
concentrated markets were often a byproduct of economies of scale, not
anticompetitive practices. But if bigness doesn’t necessarily make
consumers worse off, then bigness as such isn’t really the
problem. Antitrust policy, according to Chicago, should target only
behaviors that actually reduce consumer welfare, and otherwise leave
the market alone.</p>
<p>The Chicago view was profoundly influential on American antitrust
law. Bork’s book was cited approvingly by the Supreme Court almost
immediately after it came out, and the consumer welfare standard is
still the dominant consideration in antitrust law today. As a result,
government started to take a much more laissez-faire approach to
mergers and acquisitions than it had for most of the twentieth
century....</p>
<p>[But concentration was causing problems everywhere] the poultry
industry is dominated by just a handful of processing companies. This
means that farmers are often in a 'take it or leave it' situation with
respect to the processors, on whom they depend for their
livelihood. About a decade ago, the federal government was running a
series of listening sessions to learn more about problems faced by
farmers in the industry. But many of the chicken farmers simply didn’t
show up. The reason? The processors had threatened to retaliate
against them if they did, and that was a risk they simply couldn’t
afford to take. The processing companies were using their market power
to silence workers, effectively undermining both their freedom of
speech and their ability to improve their working conditions"</p>

<em>Prophets of War: Lockheed Martin and the Making of the

shocking exposé of the colossal company and the enormous breadth of
its reach and influence. Hartung notes that in 2008 alone, Lockheed
Martin had $36 billion in total federal contracts, 29 billion of which
came from Pentagon contracts, making it not only the nation’s leading
weapons contractor but the top overall government contractor as
well. The astronomical amounts spent on contracts with Lockheed Martin
came out to approximately 260 dollar per taxpaying household,
appropriately called 'the Lockheed Martin tax.'"</p>

<p>So long as competitors can destroy each other with, in theory, better
products, better prices, etc., then capitalists will serve demand in
pursuit of profit. They do this wantonly, exuding toxic externalities;
nevertheless the taps run and the grocer holds inventory. But profit
dwindles over time, such is its destiny. Capitalists eventually turn
on each other not as competitors, but as existential threats. Through
acquisition and capture, all sectors tend toward monopoly as even the
state becomes a servant of profit alone. The competition necessary to
hold capitalists accountable to the governance of production ceases,
leaving a corporatist coven of a few unaccountable owners. Why would
they need price corrections?</p>
<p>So, maybe the obvious AI bubble doesn't burst. Maybe crypto grifts
remain eternal. Maybe property speculation fuels homelessness for the
rest of our lives. Maybe the cost of groceries mysteriously outpaces
inflation by an order of magnitude, and all we ever hear is that the
good line went up.</p>
<p>This only becomes possible because the few remaining capitalists have
lost all accountability to the governance of production. Not merely
that they are immune to prosecution for abuses, but that they have
become totally divorced from the realities of administration. It does
not matter what conditions are really like, how production or
consumption really behave, because all that these corporatists see is
their own propaganda: that the good line went up. Their machinations
prove inept, aloof. They fizzle, like the Metaverse, a meaningless
waste..</p>
<p>Does this abstention of governance feel like a void, or a hell-hail?
Repression rains from the federal while blue team sends fundraising
emails. So, we must distinguish what we call our governments —
pageantries for settlers in a theology of illusory consent — from the
actual work of governance.</p>
<p>It may seem obvious. Governance concerns the marshaling of
sufficiency, by organizing (or mediating the organization of) the
means of production. The goal of governance is providence, for the
governed but more broadly for life itself. Why else are we alive if
not to celebrate and perpetuate the cycle of mortality? Why should I
not abolish hunger? Why would you expect any less of a compassionate
order? Why should not all justice be restorative, all plenitude
enduring?</p>
<p>It thus grows clear that despite a system of entities calling
themselves governments, virtually no governance occurs in our lives,
and it is all done by corporatists. Famine is only stayed in the food
desert by the supply chain of McDonald's. The hospital seeks profit;
if you're lucky, they'll extend credit. The university takes dividends
from genocidaires and the extinctionists of oil. In many places, it is
even illegal to perform the work of governance, as feeding those
unhoused and hungry comes to risk arrest. Resisting the eviction
notice is, so to say, an easy way to arrange a confrontation with the
overwhelming force of militarized police"</p>

the Air Force decided that it needed a larger aircraft—something much

world, within days rather than weeks or months... This impulse was the
genesis of the C-5A Galaxy, the largest military aircraft ever
built.. One of the more controversial aspects of the proposed plane
was its projected ability to get war matériel to any spot in the world
on extremely short notice — 'like having a military base in nearly
every strategic spot on the globe,' as a Lockheed marketing brochure
put it. But this military strong point was viewed as a political
liability by Senator William Fulbright (D-AR), then the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee chairman. He argued in 1969, when the first C-5As
were nearing production, that 'if we have big planes which will, on a
moment’s notice, take two or three divisions to every outbreak that
may occur, we will be tempted to do it'"</p>

<p>Jacob Barandes: "[T]his paper.. uses the stochastic-quantum
correspondence to show that physical models based on configuration
spaces combined with stochastic dynamics can replicate all the
empirical predictions of textbook quantum theory — including
interference, decoherence, entanglement, noncommutative observables,
and wave-function collapse — without relying on the austere and
metaphysically opaque Dirac-von Neumann axioms..  In this alternative
approach, a given system moves stochastically along a physical
trajectory in a classical-looking configuration space"</p>

<p>Barandes' model starts with stochastic laws of which current quantum
mech is a projection, an instantiation of... The funkiness of QM is
the result of giving something up whilst that transition, from
stochastic to deterministic.</p>
<p>He referenced Edward Nelson who was one of the founders of stochastic
theory of quantum mechanics, worked on zero-point field view of
matter, Cetta, and Luis de la Pena mention him in their work. Barandes
succeeded almost by mistake according to his telling of his story, his
model went further than Nelson's because he used non-Markovian
(non-divisible) stochastic process which bridged the divide between
what is known today and a reasonable explainable physical law.</p>

<hr />
<p>Matthew Hass, UCCS: "Somewhere between the end of 2000 and mid
2001.. Goldman Sachs (GS), facilitated several intricate transactions
with Greece. These transactions employed trading methods utilizing
elaborate financial derivatives (particularly security swaps) with the
purpose of concealing Greek national debt. The Hellenic Republic of
Greece was the newest member of the Eurozone at the time.</p>
<p>In order to remain in the European Union (EU), a nation must meet and
uphold financial policies per the Maastricht Treaty. The two limits
imposed on government finances were the following: '3% for the ratio
of the planned or actual government deficit to gross domestic product
[GDP] at market prices,' and '60% for the ratio of [total] government
debt to gross domestic product [GDP] at market prices'.. In an effort
to hide Greece’s swelling public debt from EU regulators (in 2009 debt
to GDP ratio was 130%), Goldman Sachs implemented over-the-counter
(OTC) trades—private trades occurring outside any regulated securities
exchange. These trades involved exchanges of derivative contracts
(swaps) between GS and Greece. In short, Goldman Sachs succeeded in
avoiding EU scrutiny by giving Greece an off-the-books loan.</p>
<p>Greece’s publicly reported deficit/debt ratios were artificially
reduced in 2001 by effectively issuing the country an upfront
‘cash-advance,’ through the use of cleverly crafted swaps by Goldman
Sachs, at a time when such a ‘loan’ was not required by Eurostat to be
reported as a liability. Therefore, the unconventional pseudo-loan was
not only kept off the public books, it was also explicitly used to
write-down the existing sovereign debt load as though the funds were
in fact surplus government revenue..</p>
<p>Since these swaps and loans were kept off the books, no higher entity
could crosscheck the methods or numbers used by Goldman Sachs. The
swaps implemented were cross-currency swaps (CCSs) which GS
specifically engineered with fictitious exchange rates. This gave the
deal a lure of profitability and a guise of stability to the Hellenic
Republic.</p>
<p>These tactics may have given Greece the appearance of an improving
financial position (required by the Maastricht Treaty for membership
in the Eurozone), but they essentially created a house of cards that
could only stand for so long"</p>

<p>Ruffini, <em>Party of the People</em>, 2023: "It needs to be repeated that
Trump lost the 2020 election. Neither his gains in key groups nor his
false narratives about a stolen election change this fact. But Trump’s
performance was testament to the resiliency of a Republican coalition
built around the working-class voter, which in 2020 had grown to
include more nonwhite voters. The rise of multiracial working-class
conservatism, once on track to merit but a small footnote in the story
of a landslide Trump defeat, instead became a crucial reason why the
election was so close. For Republicans, this proved to be both a
blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it sketched out a future road
map to winning over diverse nonwhite voters on the same terms that it
had won over white working-class voters. On the other hand, the
closeness of the result gave Trump little reason to leave the stage,
his presence clouding Republican prospects in the 2022 midterms—and
the 2024 presidential race"</p>
