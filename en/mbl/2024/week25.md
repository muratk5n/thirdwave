.. Since LLMs have also infected print books and scientific journals
with misinfo, it won't just be the effective end of the Web. It will
be the end of all sources that you don't have a personal connection
with. Finding new info will require finding a human who can tell you
through real- world experience whether that mushroom foraging guide is
dangerous nonsense"

Rigzone: "Peoples, an essential utilities company, is spearheading a
demonstration project to produce zero-emission hydrogen energy at
scale. The project, underway in Western Pennsylvania, is a joint
undertaking by Peoples, H Quest and the University of Pittsburgh’s
Swanson School of Engineering, Peoples said in a statement. [The
company] installed one of H Quest’s proprietary microwave pyrolysis
units at its training center in McKeesport to transform natural gas
into pure hydrogen (H2) without CO2 emissions. The process creates
what is often referred to as turquoise hydrogen"

Megaconstellations like Starlink will increase atmospheric aluminum
oxide amounts to 646% over natural levels ( +360 metric tons / year ).

It will take up to 30 years for the aluminum oxides to drift down to
stratospheric altitudes, where 90% of Earth's ozone is located.

Once there aluminum oxide will act as a catalyst with chlorine harming
the ozone layer"

Deihl: "H.R. 8070, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for
fiscal year 2025 features the usual increase in “defense” spending to
a record $883.7 billion.. 883.7 billion works out to about 2600, for
each one of us Americans spreading corporatocracy far and wide, shell
by shell, proxy war by proxy war."

Energy Live News: "Wales & West Utilities (WWU) has launched a study,
funded by Ofgem, to investigate how the UK's existing gas network can
be adapted for hydrogen refuelling stations"

Nick Bano: "Worth remembering that [UK] ‘intentional homelessness’ was
invented to prevent queue-jumping for council flats.. Things have
degraded, and the problem it was designed to solve is now
unimaginable. It’s a relic in a country with world-beating
homelessness statistics"

Tony Blink Blink 737 must have overruled it. This smells like the
doing of the surface state... Military-industrial-donor complex
control of high-levels of goverment on display. The depths are fine,
the top is corrupted, amoral, mercantile.

The Guardian: "The state department falsified a report earlier this
month to absolve Israel of responsibility for blocking humanitarian
aid flows into Gaza, overruling the advice of its own experts,
according to a former senior US official who resigned this week.

Stacy Gilbert left her post as senior civil military adviser in the
state department’s bureau of population, refugees and migration, on
Tuesday. She had been one of the department’s subject matter experts
who drafted the report mandated under national security memorandum 20
(NSM-20) and published on 10 May...

Even more controversially, the report said the state department did
not 'currently assess that the Israeli government is prohibiting or
otherwise restricting the transport or delivery of US humanitarian
assistance' in Gaza. It was a high-stakes judgment because under a
clause in the Foreign Assistance Act, the US would be obliged to cut
arms sales and security assistance to any country found to have
blocked delivery of US aid"
