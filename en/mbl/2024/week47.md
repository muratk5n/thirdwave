DIW: "[Our study shows e]nvironmental zones have positive effects on
school performance and mental health – More primary school students

"Environmental Zones (Umweltzonen) in Germany.. There are three
different stickers: a green one certifying that the vehicle is
environmentally acceptable; a yellow one for less acceptable vehicles
and a red one for those that are still less acceptable... Gasoline-
and diesel-powered vehicles without catalytic converters will be
unable to get any kind of a sticker and will not be permitted in the
environmental zones. All gasoline-powered cars with catalytic
converters will get a green sticker. The first environmental zones
were established on January 1, 2008 in Berlin, Cologne and Hannover"

Academic degrees should play a lesser role, also, they way degrees are
judged needs to change. We need to go back to a [fail/pass based
education](./0119/2011/02/grading.html) where student study the
subject until a pass grade, however long that takes. The system can be
turned upside down, pre-recorded videos deliver the lecture, pass/fail
judgement will require an actual person, that professional/expert
would be part of a DOED team of expert test adminstrators. Exam would
be scheduled at will whenever a student feels ready.

One scifi episode has three characters deciding who should do a risky
task, one of them says let's decide by short stick, they prepare the
sticks. The super duper scientist character, who doesn't want to do
the task, tells one "you go first". But whoever goes first has the
least chance of picking the short stick, 1/3. After he picks a long
one, the others have 1/2 of picking the short stick. Whoever wrote for
this series did not know probability all that well.

1996 "welfare reform", who were for, who were against? Bruce Reed,
f-ing Rahm -of course- were for it, S12S, Bob Reich against. According
to S12S, Bill was mostly delusional about his place in history during
discussions ("the poor need me to be prez, I need to pass this bill to
remain prez"), like batshit cuckoo. That triangulation stuff truly
must have messed up his brain.

Hart connections again. An "Atari Democrat" as they were called back
then, became Clinton advisor.

Wiki: "[Sidney] Blumenthal played a major role in Gary Hart's bid for
the 1984 Democratic presidential nomination. Although Hart's bid was
ultimately unsuccessful, Blumenthal wrote a speech that was considered
a positive 'turning point' that established Hart's viability, and he
wrote a cover story on Hart in The New Republic. Discomfort with
Blumenthal's political involvement contributed to The Washington Post
reassigning him to its 'Style' section"

CleanTechnica: "The massive Chevron Questa molybdenum mine in New
Mexico was an environmental disaster of epic proportions until it
closed in 2014, and now an intricate, decades-long remediation effort
is under way. In the latest development, plans are in the works to
produce green hydrogen at the site, with the ultimate goal of enabling
the local utility to fill a critical storage gap in its renewable
energy profile...

KCEC has been relying on lithium-ion battery technology for energy
storage. However, typical BESS (battery energy storage systems) only
last a few hours. In contrast, the US Department of Energy is
targeting a bare minimum of 10 hours for long duration systems on up
to the range of weeks or even months, enabling grid managers to call
upon stored-up renewable energy when solar or wind resources fall
short, day or night.

With that in mind, KCEC plans to add locally produced green hydrogen
to its portfolio. Though hydrogen tends to attract media attention as
a input for fuel cell electric cars, it is also regarded as a
transportable, scalable energy storage medium. Hydrogen can sit in
storage tanks indefinitely, until called into use. KCEC anticipates
that its green hydrogen network will provide up to 16 hours of
storage, about 4-6 times more than it presently gets from its battery
arrays. The hydrogen will also be used to as fuel for the heavy-duty
remediation vehicles plying the site"

Stuff White People Like: "Since all white people consider themselves
to be 'creative,' they are constantly in need of products and
accessories that will allow them to capture their thoughts.  One of
the more popular products in recent years has been the Moleskine
notebook.

This particular type of notebook is very expensive and was quite
popular with writers and artists in the olden days.  Needless to say,
these are two properties that are highly coveted in the white
community.  In fact, it’s a good rule of thumb to know that white
people like anything that old writers and artists liked: typewriters,
journals, suicide, heroin, and trains are just a few examples.

Much like virtually everything else that white people like, these
notebooks are considerably more expensive yet provide no additional
functionality over regular notebooks that cost a dollar.  Thankfully,
since white people only keep their most original and creative ideas in
the Moleskine, many of them will only be required to purchase one per
lifetime"

The only reason this branch of Democrat ever found a breathing room
for itself was due to a unique, toxic mix of Soviet collapse, a few
initial PR success of high-tech, and a good economy. These events
created the environment for anti-worker, pro PMC, pro-business,
Republican (now called RINO), Gary Hart politics to take hold in the
Democratic party. The situation was unique, almost an outlier. But now
Dems are stuck with a leadership that are manufactured to fit that
outlier. These people are cancer. They need to be treated as such.

If Ruffini's account of the 2000 election is correct, then Donna
Brazil did better as campaign manager than seemed at first. Looking
purely at the numbers it was natural to conclude Gore had an advantage
but lost, campaigning had to be the culprit. The deeper story seems to
be the perception of Gore was so bad he could actually suffer a bigger
loss even with that advantage. Only a renewed focus on working class
rhetoric alleviated the initial setback pushing Gore within a few
hundred votes in Florida.

---

The protections he undid were proposed by the New Deal to combat the
effects of the Great Depression. That's why the "reforms" proved
ineffective to combat the aftermath of GFC, the Great Financial Crisis
(which, BTW, Bill is also responsible for creating).

"Transforming politics" my ass... he f--ked it all up. Clueless buffoon

Frank: "Whether [1996 welfare reform] was the right thing to do with
poor moms and impoverished children was of little interest in
Washington. What thrilled the pundit class was the sheer
counter-scheduling genius of it all. Welfare reform was the glorious
moment when Bill Clinton arrived at the end of his long search for
himself; when he and the world knew for sure that he was a New
Democrat and he was announcing it, loud and proud. 'When he signed the
bill, the final cornerstone of our Clinton revolution was in place,'
rejoiced DLC chieftain Al From. 'There would never again be a doubt
that he was a different kind of Democrat.' John Harris, the founder of
Politico, interpreted it in the same way: 'With his signature Clinton
had proven that he was indeed an authentic New Democrat, ready to
break with old liberalism, even at personal cost.'

It had all the elements of the magic formula. Welfare reform
'triangulated' between the positions of the two parties, to use the
term made famous by Clinton’s advisers. It erased one of the
fundamental achievements of the New Deal. It harmed an important
constituency of Clinton’s party, meaning the poor, and simultaneously
it negated one of the GOP’s most potent issues, thus allowing the
president, as his aide Sidney Blumenthal put it, to 'undercut the
Republicans and begin transforming politics.'

Vox: "[2016] 'If the goal was to get rid of poverty, we failed': the
legacy of the 1996 welfare reform.. Ten years after signing the bill,
[Clinton] took an enthusiastic victory lap in the pages of the New
York Times. 'Welfare reform has proved a great success,' he
declared... But another 10 years later, the mood.. changed.. New
research had showed that in fact welfare reform fell short in the
depths of the Great Recession — substantially increasing deep poverty
and leaving families who can’t find work without any cash safety net"

---

The Obamas are on their 3rd, 4th *château* now..? Black Bill Clinton
gives them valuable speeches too, the business community must really
like. But the Obamas are fine... they need to "represent", we'll turn
a blind eye to that.  Bama is not doing anything his patron saint Bill
would not do anyway...

---

CNN: "[2016/02] Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill
Clinton, combined to earn more than $153 million in paid speeches from
2001 until Hillary Clinton launched her presidential campaign last
spring, a CNN analysis shows... In total, the two gave 729 speeches
from February 2001 until May, receiving an average payday of 210,795
dollar for each address. The two also reported at least 7.7 million
for at least 39 speeches to big banks, including Goldman Sachs and
UBS, with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic 2016 front-runner,
collecting at least 1.8 million for at least eight speeches to big
banks"

---

Speaking fees are a form of corruption.. While in office pol executes
pro corporate policies that benefit a business, after leaving office
gets invited by that same business to give "speeches" with a price tag
upwards of a quarter mil..  No one gives speeches that valuable.. but
the *value* was delivered beforehand, while in office. Now corrupt
politician gets paid in kind.

Robert Solow: "You see the computer age everywhere but in the

The IT revolution wasn't much of a revolution. It ended up being fairy
dust on the existing system, inequalities remained the same, and some
became entrenched because of a new group that gained "class
conciousness" and captured a big chunk of the Democratic party. The
shine really started to come off when the "Twitter Revolution" went
bust in lands of Arab Spring, and with meager growth in the developed
world it became clear tech was not driving anything except a phony
rise in stock prices. Krugman was right on this one, as far as output
is concerned, "the Internet's impact on the economy has been no
greater than the fax machine". There is a spiffy "web site" for health
insurance, yet 85 million people in US are uninsured or
underinsured. What did the tech deliver? Nothing except an illusion,
the mirage of progress.

---

Bill Clinton is the figure to destroy because he was the first prez
elected after the fall of Berlin Wall, at the same time an IT
"revolution" of sorts took place seemingly confirming the "vision" of
these fucktards, the followers of Gary Hart. The wall fell, and
everything that followed was assumed to be "the new world order", a
bizarre concoction of anti-worker, pro-capital, globalisation-ran-wild
sentiment/politics... All of that culminated in Bill presidency and
most Dems afterwards adapted this blueprint. Sadly, the approach, and
the man had glaring deficiencies. Dems need to remove this fudge from
their collective worldview, as the eclectic ideo clearly, visibly
stopped working. Dems who followed it just lost a key
demographic. Somebody needs to pay the price for that.

FuelCellsWorks: "The US Department of Defense is scouting for new
clean power resources on its vast and numerous bases. The aim is to
cut dependence on off-base civilian electrical infrastructure. New,
enhanced geothermal energy systems are beginning to offer that
opportunity, and the US Air Force is already exploring how to deploy
them for producing green hydrogen...

In September, the Air Force put out the call for vendors to come up
with a next-generation geothermal system that can be deployed to
produce green hydrogen for fuel cells, with the entire operation
taking place on federal property..

The Defense Department stepped up its search for alternative fuels
during the Obama administration with a focus on biofuels, only to face
pushback from Republican members of Congress. To this day, the
transition to biofuel still faces a long, slow road. Now the one-two
punch of green hydrogen and geothermal energy is poised to give the
Army, Navy, and Air Force what they wanted all along: a non-fossil,
zero emission, sustainable, resilient, and secure energy resource"

The future can be stag**de**flationary rather than
stagflationary. Rates will be low and growth will be meager. Corporate
Democrats along with Republicans did away with the social assistance
that helped society, supplying the free stuff capitalism needs to
produce its gadgets and trinkets, they killed growth. The root of
growth is [know-how](../../0119/2017/08/economic-complexity-hidalgo.html)
(not capital). You can only get know-how by concentrated areas of
skill/capability, that requires some form of social harmony, as in
safety net where people are not fighting tooth and nail to get basic
essentials.

Andersen writes "when Hart ran a second time for president in 1988,

If that wasn't convincing, look at who is on the other side; opposite

This is the stupidest comment I've ever read. Ukraine was and is a
state, Palestinians never had one. The only thing Ukraine had to do
act like a responsible state, measure your strength, check your near
neighbors, form alliances (yes with Russia, and it was possible) to
neutralize them, think ahead for the worst. Ukraine did not act like a
state, it acted like a plutocratic hellhole that is in control of
US/UA oligarchs. We can't compare that with Palestine.

Doctorow: "While there are many independently maintained servers that
provide services to Bluesky and its users, there is only one Bluesky
server. A federation of multiple servers, each a peer to the other
[like Mastodon], has been on Bluesky's roadmap for as long as I've
been following it, but they haven't (yet) delivered it.

That was worrying when Bluesky was a scrappy, bootstrapped startup
with a few million users. Now it has grown to over 13 million users,
and it has taken on a large tranche of outside capital..

Plenty of people have commented that now that a VC is holding
Bluesky's purse-strings, enshittification will surely follow (doubly
so because the VC is called 'Blockchain Capital,' which, at this
point, might as well be 'Grifty Scam Caveat Emptor Capital')... A VC
that understands that they can force you to wreck your users' lives is
always in danger of doing so"

Kennard: "Keynes.. proposed an International Clearing Union (ICU) with
its own independent currency called 'the bancor'. The bancor would be
a universal unit of accounting that countries across the globe could
use that would track trade deficits and surpluses. An 'objective' unit
would ensure that equal pressure fell on both the creditor and the
debtor to balance their trade. But such a body would constrain the
powerful creditor nations like the US, which were using their loans
and export capacity as a method of control. For this reason, the ICU
never happened; [Harry Dexter] White [from US] opposed it. Instead, he
wanted an International Stabilization Fund and the IBRD. The purpose
of the Stabilization Fund would be to reduce foreign exchange
controls, maintain steady exchange rates and lend money to nations in
deficit. The bank would provide the capital that was desperately
needed by faltering countries to rebuild after the war. And this was
the formulation that was eventually agreed upon. It completely took
the burden off the creditor nations (like the US) in terms of balance
of trade. Put simply, there was now no restriction on the amount of
surplus a successful exporting nation could enjoy. As a country
borrowed more and more, interest rates just rose and rose. This
formula was perfect for accelerating the racket’s dominance. Foreign
countries became markets for American goods and started to rely,
heavily, on US capital.
