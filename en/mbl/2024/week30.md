You are one update away from a blue screen of death and it will be
literal in your case. That blue color will be last thing you'll see
before your fatal calamity. That commercial, consumer-oriented bloat
was not written with you in mind, its basic assumptions is minesweeper,
as in the game.

I bet that system is still effin there..

Computerworld: "[2008] The Royal Navy and BAE Systems
plc.. announce[d] that their implementation of Windows for Submarines
is complete ahead of schedule. Windows boxes on Ethernet LANs are now
in control of the UK‚Äôs nuclear-propelled and nuclear-armed warship
fleet... Many in the software community have viewed the Royal Navy‚Äôs
wholesale move to Windows-based command systems with concern, feeling
that the savings are not such as to justify possible losses in
security, reliability and assurance"

Europe is where it's at brother

"Switzerland mandates software source code disclosure for public
sector: A legal milestone.. Switzerland's new 'public money public
code' law is a great opportunity for government, the IT industry and
society. All stakeholders benefit from this new regulation since the
public sector can reduce vendor lock-in, companies can grow their
digital business solutions, and taxpayers spend less on IT solutions
and receive better services due to increased competition and
innovation' [says an expert St√ºrmer who] has been a pivotal advocate
for this change. With a background in digital sustainability and open
source community building, St√ºrmer has long argued for the benefits of
OSS in enhancing digital transparency and reducing dependency on
proprietary software"

\#Switzerland mandates #OpenSource software for all public software!
This makes perfect sense. Public software should be transparent"

AJ does speak some truth (he needs to be heard, not shut
down). And.. saying "the devil is real" is basically being a Christian
isn't it? Does ProPublica have a problem with the religious? You know
they vote right? When you demonize (!) ppl they might just vote for
the *other* party that is not yours, just to poke you in the eye.
I am assuming since PP is for the learn-ed, the educated, their party
would be Democrats. Don't be so quick to belittle.

Politico: "Biden‚Äôs exit blows a hole in the political rise of
ambitious Democrats.. Things just got a whole lot more complicated for
2028 hopefuls. Democrats have no shortage of rising stars who were
just four years away from a potential run for the White House. Now
they are faced with an urgent question: Do they throw their hat into
the ring now.. or do they rally around Vice President Kamala Harris ‚Äî
holding out for their moment, even if it could now take eight more
years?.. Though many serious challengers appear to be standing down,
it‚Äôs unclear if all of them will. There have been murmurs in recent
weeks about a number of top Democratic governors"

---

A new negative now is that Democrats started to look like the party of
chaos. Reps will sling trouble from every which direction, "if Biden
does not run again, is he fit to be President?", "can the existing
campaign cash used by Kamala [if nominated]?"..

Politico: "[The f]ear of 1968 is overdone. Arguably, many Americans
feel that the Democratic Party withheld important information about
Biden‚Äôs condition during the primaries. If the party now imposes a
nominee without competition, voters may feel disenfranchised again"

---

Politico: "Harris.. nodded to the need to 'earn and win' the
nomination in her statement ‚Äî an acknowledgment that a competition,
not a coronation, puts her in the best position going into the general
election"

The Guardian: "Signs of two gases in clouds of Venus could indicate
life, scientists say.. Separate teams find evidence of phosphine and
ammonia, potential biomarkers..  [at] about 50km (31 miles above the
surface) the temperature and pressure are closer to conditions on
Earth ‚Äì and potentially just about survivable for very hardy
microbes.. On Earth, phosphine gas is produced by microbes in
oxygen-starved environments..

'Our findings suggest that when the atmosphere is bathed in sunlight
the phosphine is destroyed,' [physicist] Clements said. 'All that we
can say is that phosphine is there. We don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs producing
it. It may be chemistry that we don‚Äôt understand. Or possibly life'"

I just got a copyright claim against a video I posted on youtube 10
years ago.

The video is a film by Georges Melies that was shot in the 1890s.

Someone is attempting to claim copyright over a film that is 130 years
old, who's director died 86 years ago.

Now 1) I don't give a shit about this clip on youtube. 2) The person
who made this claim is clearly in the wrong. 3) I can't be the only
one that they have targeted illegally"

Reuters: "Spain to launch new $2.5 billion plan to support green
hydrogen, renewable industry"

---

ABC News: "California will be the first state to receive federal funds
under a program to create regional networks, or ‚Äúhubs,‚Äù that produce
hydrogen as an energy source for vehicles, manufacturing and
generating electricity, officials announced Wednesday.

The U.S. Department of Energy said the California Hydrogen Hub will
receive an initial $30 million to begin its planning and design
phase. The state will eventually receive up to 1.2 billion for the
project that is a key part of the Biden administration's agenda to
slow climate change.

The administration in October selected seven regional hubs for the $7
billion program that will kickstart development and production of
hydrogen fuel, with the goal of eventually replacing fossil fuels such
as coal and oil with the colorless, odorless gas that already powers
some cars and trains"
