<p>In other words expanding universe theories are wrong. The universe is static.
There was no Big Bang.</p>
<p>Paper: "In recent years, some observational hints have emerged
indicating that the Standard Cosmological Model could require
correcting. One of these hints is related to the discovery of remote
galaxies whose redshifts correspond to the very young Universe (less
than one billion years after the Big Bang) but which are similar to
nearby galaxies. The issue is that such galaxies in the early Universe
do not have enough time to evolve into something similar to the
late-Universe galaxies...</p>
<p>We compare this result with predictions of the standard ŒõCDM [Big
Bang] cosmological model and some static cosmological models,
including Zwicky‚Äôs.. model. The latter is currently assumed to be
ruled out by observations. We challenge this assumption and show that
a static model can provide a natural and straightforward way of
solving the puzzle of the well-evolved galaxies and better agreements
with the results of the JWST 'angular diameter‚Äîredshift' test at
higher redshifts than the correcting evolution model within the ŒõCDM
framework"</p>

<p>We mentioned the 'axis of evil' issue before.. there is a correlation
between the plane of our solar system and aspects of the CMB. That
should not be possible... The "afterglow of the Big Bang" cannot be
aligned that perfectly with our solar system. If however the CMB
originated from our solar system, due to a measurement error made by
incompetent physicist who thought they were measuring something but
actually measuring something else, the fail can be explained. CMB is
likely nothing but a reflection from Earth's oceans, a local
phenomenon rather than "cosmic". It's sad.</p>
<hr />
<p>The case against the Cosmic Microwave Background itself, a big feature
of Big Bang, is also getting stronger... The universe expansion
(Hubble) constant can be calculated two different ways. One uses CMB,
the other looks at nearby galaxies. Two calculations do not agree. How
could that be? Not possible, unless something went very wrong at the
root of cosmology.</p>
<hr />
<p>Eric Lerner: "The Big Ring contradicts another basic feature of the
Big Bang hypothesis.. and that's what's called the Cosmological
Principle.. [CP] is a very simple assumption, it is the assumption
that the universe at a large enough scale is completely homogeneous
and isotropic. In other words, it has no structure at a large enough
scale, it's smooth like a well-made pudding. This hypothesis is
fundamental to the theoretical basis of the Big Bang hypothesis.</p>
<p>You may have heard incorrectly from some people that General
Relativity predicts that the Big Bang must have happened, that the
universe must be expanding or contracting. That's not true. What is
true is that the equations of General Relativity predict an expanding
or contracting universe if you also assume the cosmological principle
that the universe at a large enough scale is completely homogenous,
the same density at every point, and isotropic, the same density in
every direction..</p>
<p>If there is structure at the scales that are larger than that
predicted by The Big Bang, larger than the scales at which objects
could form in the time since the Big Bang, larger than the scale of
about about half a billion light years, then the cosmological
principle is wrong"</p>
<hr />
<p>Space.com: "An intergalactic ring-shaped superstructure of
galaxies.. so large it defies explanation ‚Äî has been discovered..
Cosmological theory [Big Bang] suggests that the largest structures..

Giant Arc dwarf this constraint"</p>

another reason, regular VVD origin story is too tied to Fantastic Four
whose reboot is not out yet, plus it can flop then everything
downstream is screwed. If VVD is tied to Stark's background however,
on an established backdrop, with RDJ's face and acting chops now you
are steaming ahead.</p>
<hr />
<p>How will they explain Doom looks like Stark? A claim is a variation of
