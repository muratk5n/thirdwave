<p>Clinton had high numbers but he was the instigator of a lot of bad
policies whose effect were not visible yet. The effects of
Glass-Steagal reversal would not be felt until 2008, or passage of
NAFTA leading to an opiod crisis among the working class late 2020s,
or the effects of 1996 Telecommunication Act screwing up the media
landscape visibly at around 2010. The mismanagement of the anti trust
regulator GIPSA would be witnessed clearly in meat product high prices
in 2022. Obviously the giant fuck up of the Palestinian issue finally
resulted in October 7 2023. Clinton is clearly the worst president of
the past 60 years, his screw ups simmered, broke stuff left and right
and propagated forward decades, and he set up a model, an example to
follow creating characters like the Black Bill Clinton. The pro-market
business-friendly environment allowed by "centrist" Democrats ran the
country into the ground, and Presidential net approval numbers went
down with it. Because now the entire system is messed up, the balance
is gone. The right wants small government, and the supposed left? They
also want small government. Halle-fu**ing-luyah.  Then hurricane hits,
where is government? Got no money bitch. Help yourself.  Start a
GoFundMe to pull that tree out of your house bedroom, or move the cow
that landed on your porch.</p>
<hr />
<p>Incumbent presidential net approval trend across administrations is
down. From high positive numbers during 2000 it went down to 0, -12,
-22 for 2012, 2020, 2024.  If the system remains unchanged, approvals
will go down further still, DJT will likely see -25 by the end of his
term.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Dem A-team (good campaigners, better closers) stayed out of this
one, no one contested Harris' "coronation" because they must have felt
the time was not advantegous for them. Next time Reps will have a
disadvantage, and the better campaigners on the Dem side will come out
of the woodwork.</p>

<p>The net approval of the incumbent president effects whoever runs from
that same party. There were some positive changes during 2020-2024 but
not enough. Much more was needed.</p>

<p>CNBC: "The Trump rally begins"</p>
<hr />
<p>Al Jazeera: "It was anger that won Trump this election.. Despite
obviously belonging to America’s financial super-elite, the
billionaire Trump has wooed a wide sector of the domestic working
class into viewing him as a saviour from their economic plight in a
plutocratic system... The indignant appeal to 'Make America Great
Again' deliberately ignores the fact that there was never anything
great about a nation predicated on mass socioeconomic inequality,
where Republicans and Democrats alike perpetuate plutocracy under the
guise of democracy"</p>

<p>Less wars is great .. MAGA's staying power increases via this win,
much preferable to seeing these neocon freaks meandering about like

implosion of Liz Cheney - the candidate she and Papa Cheney had
endorsed lost in a big way.</p>
<hr />
<p>The electorate is desparate... They wildly oscillate between choices
every election now. Let's not forget Trump lost to a challenger in
2020 and only won his second time as a challenger himself. For 2028
Reps, Trump's successor will likely experience the same fate. Pro
business policies are not a panacea. Rates will go lower and stay
low. The market already started talking about the return of the "Trump
trade" which is the rise of all assets that will help the wealthy,
raise inequality.</p>
<p>On the bright side less immigration and trade limits will be
good... If the value of citizenship rises (through less foreign born)
a citizen's demand from the government will be taken more seriously,
it will have more weight. DJT will end up helping the left in the long
term.</p>

<p>Fisk: "Barak wanted talks with the Syrians, and the same old
negotiating routine was quickly re-established. The Syrians still
wanted the return of all of Golan. But why wouldn’t the Syrians accept
just a bit of Golan? Or Golan with the settlements? Or part of Golan
plus an unknown number of Israeli troops to maintain early warning
stations?  The world was reminded that Syria had 'threatened' Israel
from Golan before the 1967 war. But Assad called Barak an honest and
'strong' man, for he, too, did not want to be blamed for any new
failures. When Clinton travelled to meet Assad when Labour was
previously in power in Israel, Syria had been portrayed as the nation
that rejected peace, 'the spanner in the works,' in the words of CNN’s
reporter. In truth, nothing had changed. Israel wanted diplomatic
relations and economic links with Damascus before any discussion of
how much of Golan might be returned to Syria. Having watched Arafat
writhing with this equation— only to find that having recognised
Israel and compromised the very idea of statehood, Israel would decide
Palestine’s future — Assad was not enamoured of the idea that this
was, in Clinton’s own words, a 'golden opportunity' to make peace. It
was a familiar scenario. Accept Israel’s version of peace and Syria
could be overwhelmed by conditions she could not meet. Refuse, and
Syria would be blamed for opposing peace and become an enemy of peace
and - ergo - an enemy of the United States"</p>

<p>Fisk: "Clinton wanted to be the author of a 'peace' that he stubbornly
refused to guarantee.  We heard the old refrain from Clinton, that
while Washington could 'bring the parties together,' it was for 'the
parties themselves' to take the 'hard decisions.' Thus Israel,
infinitely the more powerful of the two parties—Palestinian tanks,
after all, were not occupying Tel Aviv—could act as it wished within
or outside the framework of the Oslo accord. Off the record, we would
be told—like the Jordanian dinner guests at the White House—of
Clinton’s exasperation with Netanyahu. Publicly, he would be
silent. Yet when Palestinian violence was inflicted on Israelis,
Clinton was in lionlike mode, calling the killers 'yesterday’s men' in
Amman, and at Wye lecturing the world on the 'hate' that would
undoubtedly greet the latest success for 'peace.'</p>
<p>Sloppy use of language was also one of the most dangerous aspects of
successive American 'peace' accords. Clinton was good on cliché and
rhetoric but.. lazy when it came to points of detail. Despite all the
handshakes and platitudes at Wye, for example, both Palestinians and
Israelis went home with diametrically opposite ideas of what had been
achieved. Netanyahu was able to assure Jewish colonists that there
would be no Palestinian state, while Arafat’s men could persuade their
few remaining supporters that another Israeli withdrawal would be
another step towards statehood. No sooner had Netanyahu returned to
Israel than his foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, urged settlers to
'seize every hilltop they can' in the West Bank. In a real battle of
wits between equal partners, Arafat might have made a few
Netanyahu-like conditions: no continuation of the 'peace process'
unless Israel renounced its exclusive claim to Jerusalem as a
capital—which precluded 'final status' talks; no more Jewish
settlements on occupied Arab land; no more negotiations until
Netanyahu ended Jewish settler attacks on Palestinians. But Arafat
could not do that — and Washington would not talk to him if he did. So
the Wye talks probably ended any Palestinian hope for a just
peace. Israel would be allowed to go on building more Jewish
settlements on occupied land, confiscating Palestinian identity
papers, demolishing Palestinian homes. And Arafat — for perhaps 14 per
cent of the 22 per cent of mandate 'Palestine' that was left — had
promised to protect the Israelis who were building the settlements,
confiscating the identity papers and demolishing the homes"</p>
