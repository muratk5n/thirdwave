<p>PBS: "Tyson Foods is one of the world’s biggest meat and poultry
producers. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, it’s also a
major polluter in the United States. A new report from the group says
Tyson plants dumped more than 371 million pounds of pollutants into
U.S. waterways between 2018 and 2022"</p>
<hr />
<p>Philips: "[Studies on inequality] must also pursue troubling and
crippling side effects: high levels of political corruption, the
arrogance of global economic power, the twisting of the U.S. tax code,
and the voter belief in the captivity of government to private
interests... The inroads on American democracy in the 1980s and 1990s
have many philosophical as well as political patrons: think tanks,
university chairs, and publications joined in praise of economic
elites, corporate predators, Darwinian competition, the claims of
political moneygiving to be free speech, uninhibited markets, global
policing on behalf of investment, and 'free' enterprise (however
reliant on friendly government). Allied pundits and promoters, in
turn, have repeatedly undercut popular programs ranging from Social
Security to business regulation. Unelected judges, central bankers,
trade regulators, and global economic organizations have been
encouraged in taking over powers earlier enjoyed by elected national
leaders and legislatures. Critics counter with charges of a growing
'democratic deficit'. These trends are closely related to—indeed, many
of their conservative protagonists are funded by—America’s deepening
wealth and income concentrations"</p>
<hr />
<p>To judge the effect of an ancient migration, citizen can look in the
mirror. Do you look Asiatic, Eskimo, whatever? If not, the proportion
of newcomers to your region were small, they could not have changed
much culture (the minor changes in genetics is the proof) they did not
have the numbers to achieve it. They were assimilated into the region,
not the other way around.</p>
<p>Newer migrants can ask themselves 'where was I in my preteens?' That's
your culture. No "heritage" can persist past 0th gen. Culture is
received via osmosis, not taught, spreads subconciously. Culture is
not about rites, about mumbling stupid shit, taking an unusual day as
a vacation day. It is in the split decisions you make, it is in the
subconcious belief system that can only be given by the larger society
around you, not even by immediate family, nor relatives. </p>

<p>It looks like recent rise in inflation was transitory.</p>
<hr />
<p>Richard Murphy: "As even the Bank of England has acknowledged,
inflation in the UK arose because of external factors. That began with
price shocks from Covid reopening and then continued with oil and food
price shocks arising from the war in Ukraine. These then created
knock-on effects on other prices.</p>
<p>And, as I always argued, as these shocks worked through the system,
price changes were always going to return to normal rates, as they
have now done...</p>
<p>So did the Bank of England's interest rate increases do anything to
solve the problem? No"</p>
<hr />
<p>Andersen: "Fixing America requires reminding Americans how much they
depend on government already and convincing them to give it a chance
to return to its glory days, to prove it’s the only possible provider
of solutions to some problems, especially the messed-up political
economy and climate. Ask what you can do for your country, John
Kennedy famously said at his inauguration, and these days the first
thing to do for your country is ask and know and tell other people
what your country can do for you and does already"</p>

<p>Al Jazeera: "Billionaire backlash shows the power of basic
income.. Sparked by the first mayor-led pilot in Stockton, California
in 2019 and funded in large part by the COVID-19 relief money
distributed by the federal government, local authorities across the
country have been experimenting with unconditional cash as an upstream
social policy intervention that could form the basis of a new welfare
model.</p>
<p>The findings from these pilots are electric – improvements in
well-being, education, entrepreneurship, maternal and child health;
reductions in stress, depression, homelessness and recidivism. They
provide enough evidence to support the effectiveness of basic income
programmes.</p>
<hr />
<p>Voucher programs don't exactly sound like an ultra-capitalist
solution. Vouchers don't grow on trees do they, government hands them

<p>The [big tech] platforms have correctly assessed that they alone have

controversial speech that could survive a post-230 world. That's why
tech billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg <em>love</em> the idea of getting rid
of 230..</p>
<p>But for <em>small</em> tech providers - individuals, co-ops, nonprofits and
startups that host fediverse servers, standalone group chats and BBSes
- a post-230 world is a mass-extinction event...</p>

small tech will disappear. It's the worst of all possible worlds, a

<p>Ryan, <em>Civilized to Death</em>: "In our world, work is ubiquitous. The
server asks me if I’m still 'working on' my salad. We don’t exercise,
we 'work out.' Learning about ourselves in therapy is referred to as
'doing the work.' 'What are you working on?' has become a way of
asking who you are. Yet few of us are lucky enough to work in ways
that actually align with who we are. We roll in, cup of stimulant in
hand, shuffle papers, try to look busy and stay awake, fight the
hopelessness, then go home and drink too much. Show up, punch in, tune
out. In his semiautobiographical novel, <em>The House of the Dead</em>,
Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote, 'If one wanted to crush and destroy a man
entirely, to mete out to him the most terrible punishment... all one
would have to do would be to make him do work that was completely and
utterly devoid of usefulness and meaning.' But from factory floor to
corporate boardroom, useless, meaningless work is standard-issue in
our world. And you’re expected to be grateful to have it!"</p>

<p>'Life for hunter-gatherers was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and
short'. It turns out none of those things are true. Hunter-gatherers

fishing, picknicking.</p>

<p>That is not true at all..  Early man worked little and enjoyed lots of

<p>Keynes: "We have been expressly evolved…for the purpose of solving the
economic problem. If the economic problem is solved, mankind will be
deprived of its traditional purpose….Thus for the first time since his
creation, man will be faced with his real, his permanent problem—how
to use his freedom from pressing economic cares, how to occupy the
leisure, to live wisely and agreeably and well….[T]here is no country
and no people, I think, who can look forward to the age of leisure and
of abundance without a dread. For we have been trained too long to
strive and not to enjoy. It is a fearful problem for the ordinary
person…to occupy himself"</p>

<p>Andersen: "The government gave a pass to Facebook to buy Instagram and
WhatsApp in the 2010s, which was as if they’d let CBS buy NBC and ABC
in the 1940s. The several Facebook social media brands have five times
as many American users as the biggest platform it doesn’t own,
Twitter. Google does more than 90 percent of all Internet searches,
forty times as many as its closest competitor. As far as venture
capitalists are concerned, digital start-ups looking to compete with
the Internet colossi, no matter how amazing their new technology or
service or vision, ultimately have two alternatives: to be acquired by
Google or Facebook, or to be destroyed by Google or Facebook. If the
latter seems likelier—being in the “kill zone,” in the Valley term of
art—the VCs tend not to invest in the first place"</p>

<p>When it comes to questions around radiation, temparature, microwave,
I'd rather trust the guy who can build measurement machines with his

<hr />
<p>Paper: "[2011] COBE and WMAP have been hailed by the astrophysical
scientists as great triumphs in science, measuring the temperature of
the Universe, the ~3K Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) remnant of the
Big Bang; a signal first detected by Penzias and Wilson from the
ground, in 1965. Stephen Hawking has dubbed this 'the scientific
discovery of the century, if not of all time'. However, upon closer
examination, the claim does not stand up; in fact... [We claim] CMB is
not cosmic, but a signal produced by the oceans of the Earth:
'Throughout the detection history of the microwave background, it
remained puzzling that the Earth itself never provided interference
with the measurements. Water, after all, acts as a powerful absorber
of microwave radiation. This is well understood, both at sea aboard
submarines, and at home within microwave ovens... if the Earth's
oceans cannot interfere with these measurements, it is precisely
because they are the primary source of the signal'"</p>
<hr />
<p>Paper: "[2011] Professor of Radiology at Ohio State University, [Dr
Robitaille], is an expert when it comes to instrumentation and signal
analysis. It was [him] who conceived and directed the construction of
the world's first 8 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. In
doing so, he nearly doubled the maximum field strength in MRI and gave
birth to Ultra High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(UHFMRI). Robitaille’s scanner immediately revealed anatomical
structures within the human brain that were previously never seen on
human scans. In recent years, Robitaille has applied his skills to
astrophysics, and his findings are very significant"</p>
