<p>CH's A2/AD investments, its big navy, big as in numbers not

specifically to break blockade and risk escalation. </p>
<hr />
<p>Jestrab: "Much of the public discussion around a China-Taiwan conflict
centers on an invasion; however, a number of factors make this the
least likely scenario. The primary reason why an invasion scenario is
unlikely is that it runs contrary to the PRC’s strategic objectives
and reasons for seeking unification. An invasion would result in
significant direct physical violence against the people of Taiwan, the
population that the CCP seeks to rule. Additionally, the PRC gives
priority to economic development as a 'central task' of its continued
growth. An invasion would certainly result in harm to the Chinese
economy due to international sanctions and significant destruction to
Taiwan’s infrastructure and economy.</p>
<p>Geographic factors also make an invasion difficult, including the fact
that two-thirds of the country is rugged mountains and 80 percent of
the population lives in urban environments. Achieving success during
an invasion would likely require preemptive attacks on US and allied
forces, and there would be limited de-escalation options if this
occurred. The historical precedent is that the United States is highly
committed to wars it enters after being attacked. Unlike an invasion
scenario, a blockade could be reversable, and the level of force used
could be adjusted...</p>
<p>A blockade is the most likely and dangerous scenario, due to
Taiwan’s reliance on maritime trade to sustain its economic
prosperity. Moreover, a nonkinetic blockade is appealing to the PRC,
as it is the lowest level of coercive action that could remain below
the threshold of open hostilities and still achieve its national
objectives...</p>
<p>A successful blockade disrupting maritime trade would shutter Taiwan’s
economy. Rationing of scarce energy and food reserves, amplified by a
lack of viable resupply plans, would generate fear and uncertainty
among the Taiwanese population — in sustaining their lives, getting
their next meal, and maintaining their personal economic security. The
PRC’s actions would grind day- to-day life on the island to a
halt. Democracy is more sensitive to economic disruptions than other
forms of government, and a successful blockade could result in panic"</p>

excited.. virtually anyone with a vested interest in making
spaceflight to distant worlds more affordable. It’s water... Why? If
you split water into hydrogen and oxygen, and then liquefy those
constituents, you have rocket fuel. If you can stop at the moon’s
orbit or a lunar base to refuel, you no longer need to bring all your
propellant with you as you take off, making your spacecraft
significantly lighter and cheaper to launch. That’s important because
Earth’s atmosphere and gravitational pull necessitate use of tons of
fuel per second when rockets launch. Creating a sustainable source of

<p>Fermi's Paradox asked 'Where is everybody?'  meaning extraterrestrial
aliens, implying given the vastness of the universe and long time it
has existed, there should be advanced extraterrestrial civilizations
throughout the universe. The Drake equation aimed to answer that
question quantitatively, estimates how many active civilizations there
are in the galaxy right now. Using numbers by Andrew Dessler,</p>
<p>$$
N = R_* \cdot f_p \cdot n_e \cdot f_l \cdot f_i \cdot f_c \cdot L
$$</p>
<p>$R_*$: Number of civilizations with which humans could
communicate. Recent estimates suggest about 2 new stars are formed in
the Milky Way every year.</p>
<p>$f_P$: The average number of planets that can potentially support life
per star that has planets. Most stars have planets, estimate 0.9.</p>
<p>$N_e$: Assume 1 in 5 of stars with planets has a planet in the
habitable zone, 0.2.</p>
<p>$f_l$, $f_i$, $f_c$ : The fraction of planets that could support life
that actually develop life at some point, develop intelligent life,
and develop a technology that releases detectable signs. Wild guess
all 0.1.</p>
<p>$L$: The length of time for which such civilizations release
detectable signals. Unknown, Dessler assumes advanced civilizations
last for ten million years.</p>
<pre><code class="python">&quot;%d planets&quot; % (2 *  0.9 * 0.2 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 0.1 * 10*1e6)

10,000 years", then</p>

<p>which shows why we are the only one, and "there is no one else". And

on extreme wealth, which they view as an increasingly dire threat to
democracy. The poll was conducted by the London-based firm Survation
on behalf of the Patriotic Millionaires, an advocacy group that
campaigns for a more progressive tax system. The survey, which polled
over 2,300 millionaires in G20 nations, found that 74% 'support higher
taxes on wealth to help address the cost-of-living crisis and improve
public services'...</p>
