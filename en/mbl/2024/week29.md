flavour. So much better. Will being doing this more often!"

"Why Americans Are Nuts About Peanut Butter... First of all, the
United States grows a ton of peanuts. .. Growing peanuts became a big
thing in the early 1900s when the cotton crop was suffering in the
South, and we still grow a lot of peanuts today. Peanut butter’s birth
year explains our obsession even more. In World War I, the Great
Depression, and World War II, America was in search of inexpensive,
filling, and nutritious ways to feed its people. So people turned to
peanut butter, and it stuck. Peanut butter sandwiches were given out
in food lines during the Great Depression and were part of Army
rations in both World Wars"

---

"Americans consume [on average] about twenty-two tablespoons [of
peanut butter] per person per year... Europeans on average consume
less than one tablespoon.. per person annually"

---

Do they *have* to eat peanut based products? America is so coo coo
about peanuts some ppl not being able to eat it sounds scandalous.

NBC News: "Early treatment could help ease peanut allergies in young
kids"

Because both he and Kurt Russell played in two different movies about
Wyatt Earp and his movie sucked, Russell's movie *Tombstone* did
great. Costner might be jealous, he keeps making Westerns until he
makes a movie at the same level of *Tombstone*.

"Why does Kevin Costner keep making westerns?"

Battles around Bakhmut were an example of AW. The fact that the
frontlines "did not move" for a long time was on purpose, not due to
RU shortcomings. At one point the Wagner chief -while still alive-,
was commenting "well we could dash ahead and take Kramatorsk". But
rushing ahead taking shit is not the point.. Clearly the guy did not
get the memo. RU battle plan was about degrading UA's ability to make
war. Wag chief as a bidnessman was probably looking at the theather
like a market to incrase his share in, "I can open a corner sandwich
shop over there, I can expand..". But the RU top brass had a different
plan. He was asked to execute on a portion of that plan. He failed
(then he was died).

Vershinin: "[2024/03] The Attritional Art of War: If the West is
serious about the possibility of a great power conflict, it needs to
take a hard look at its capacity to wage a protracted war and to
pursue a strategy focused on attrition rather than
manoeuvre. Attritional wars require their own ‘Art of War’ and are
fought with a ‘force-centric’ approach, unlike wars of manoeuvre which
are ‘terrain-focused’. They are rooted in massive industrial capacity
to enable the replacement of losses, geographical depth to absorb a
series of defeats, and technological conditions that prevent rapid
ground movement. In attritional wars, military operations are shaped
by a state’s ability to replace losses and generate new formations,
not tactical and operational manoeuvres. The side that accepts the
attritional nature of war and focuses on destroying enemy forces
rather than gaining terrain is most likely to win...

Only after meeting these criteria should offensive operations
commence. They should be launched across a broad front, seeking to
overwhelm the enemy at multiple points with shallow attacks. The
intent is to remain inside a layered bubble of friendly protective
systems, while stretching depleted enemy reserves until the front
collapses. Only then should the offensive extend towards objectives
deeper in the enemy rear. Concentration of forces on one main effort
should be avoided as this gives an indication of the offensive’s
location and an opportunity for the enemy to concentrate their
reserves against this key point. The Brusilov Offensive of 1916, which
resulted in the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian army, is a good
example of a successful attritional offensive at the tactical and
operational level" via Col. Daniel Davis, Jacques Baud

Politico: "King Charles III unveiled the new U.K. Labour government’s
packed policy agenda Wednesday. It’s not going to make everyone

establishment of a publicly-owned energy company and a plan to bring
failing privatized railway networks back into public ownership"

Let’s warm up with some of Apple’s very basic failures. Apple's
facility [in Santa Clara which they fired Gjovik complaining to gov
about] has extremely toxic gases that'd create a Bhopal-like
disaster. Apple says its env friendly & thoughtful, so Apple must have
constant monitoring? Except if the power goes out. Then all the alarms
shut off"

"[The company] Savor makes delightfully rich foods without animals,
farmland, fertilizers, hormones, or antibiotics... Fat has a
recipe. We start with a source of carbon, like carbon dioxide [from
air], and use a little bit of heat and hydrogen to form chains which
are then blended with oxygen from air to make the fats & oils we know,
love and drool over. That’s how we get rich, delightful ingredients
without animal suffering, palm plantations, or dangerous
chemicals. All in the most efficient, most resilient, least polluting
way known to science"

USSR was aiding the rebels while the west was supporting
apartheid.. they later changed their minds but for a while the west
was on the wrong side. 

The Conversation: "The [South African] ANC and the former Soviet
Union have a long history together. The first visit by an ANC leader
to the Soviet Union was by Josiah Tshangana Gumede, one of the
founding members of the ANC, in 1927...

After the apartheid regime was banned the ANC in 1960 it received aid
from the Soviet Union for its exiled mission in the fight to liberate
South Africa from minority white rule. This aid exceeded that from the
pan-African Organisation of African Unity- now the African Union - or
anyone else.

It was only from the end of the 1970s that [other] donations became
higher than Soviet funding.. [but o]nly the Soviet Union provided
weapons and other military aid to the ANC’s armed wing"

Hydrogen-Powered Air Taxi.. In a significant milestone for sustainable
aviation, a hydrogen-powered air cab has completed an 842-kilometer
flight.. Joby is one of several companies at the forefront of creating
air cab services using vertical take-off and landing (VTOL)
vehicles. Initially, the company focused on developing all-electric
aircraft with a range of approximately 160 kilometers, intended for
urban and intercity transport. Joby recently adapted a prototype of
its electric aircraft to operate on hydrogen. Equipped with a liquid
hydrogen tank and a fuel system, the modified VTOL successfully
completed a flight of 842 kilometers over Marina, California, using
only 90% of its hydrogen fuel load.

design next month, and is instead pushing the event to October,
according to Bloomberg News.. The company reportedly needs more time
to build the prototypes. It had been aiming for an August 8 event. The
company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Tesla
shares fell more than 6% following the report"

Nutella said, back in 2015, "Microsoft's new computerized goggles,
HoloLens are the new desktop". You can find this reference on Business
Insider.

It's not just him, Bill Gates wrote a book with the title THE ROAD
AHEAD (1995) and it completely missed the Internet boom that would
follow in a few years. Let alone the road ahead, the book could not
see in front of its nose.

Gates did a little better after his CEO stint, maybe there's something
blinding about being a tech CEO. You are too mired in the market, your
market share, sales, every thought has to be shaped in service to
that, and they miss the general trend. They are easily gripped by
FOMO, blinded by hype.

Truthout: "[Passenger] describes how Delta Airlines threatened to kick
him off a plane over his 'Jews Say Ceasefire Now' T-shirt...

'My T-shirt displayed the text "Not in Our Name" on the front side and
"Jews Say Ceasefire Now" on the back... Before the flight had even
taken off, I was approached while I was seated on the plane by a
flight attendant who requested that I either change or cover up my
shirt because some passengers found the message offensive.. I
requested that the people who had complained about the nature of my
shirt come talk to me directly..

About 5 to 10 minutes later, a purser (also known as a chief flight
attendant or cabin manager) came to my seat and explained that I had
to cover up the shirt, because Delta had a policy against showcasing
political messages of any kind. I once again refused to cover up the
shirt. The purser then threatened to kick me off the flight unless I
obliged her wishes. Because I wanted to get to my destination, I
covered up the "Jews Say Ceasefire Now" shirt for the time being with
a nondescript white shirt. The flight took off'"

The Conversation: "Israel has reportedly approved its largest seizure
of land in the occupied West Bank in over three decades, according to
a report released on July 3 by Israeli anti-settlement watchdog, Peace
Now. The seizure involves more than 12 sq km of land in a key corridor
bordering Jordan.

Land that is privately owned by Palestinians in the West Bank can be
declared as 'state land' by Israel and subsequently seized. One of the
primary outcomes is the establishment or expansion of Israeli
settlements on the land, which are widely considered illegal under
international law"

The American Conservative: "'In Trump’s first term [his] realist
impulses were muted and sometimes stopped by hawkish national security
staffers who did not share his vision. But having learned that
personnel is policy, Trump will not make this mistake again'

So write Andrew Byers and Randall Schweller in *Foreign Affairs*.
Schweller, an academic at Ohio State, is a card-carrying foreign
policy realist, and is willing to put his name to a claim that we have
argued in these pages all along: Donald Trump, despite his mercurial
nature and despite the opposition from entrenched interests in
Washington, DC, is fundamentally displaying a realist instinct in his
foreign policy... [he writes] 'an "America first" agenda is an
intellectually defensible, fundamentally realist program that seeks to
ascertain and act on the United States’ national interests rather than
the interests of others'"

An anti M&A mindset! We can't have that!

FT: "Vance.. has been among the loudest Republican voices opposing
more US aid to Ukraine... But it is Vance’s [economy views] that has
divided the business community...

'He represents something in the country that the coastal elites and
big business have taken too long to recognise,' [a bank] lobbyist
added, in an apparent reference to Vance’s ability to channel the
anger and disenfranchisement of the working classes...

Vance has espoused a protectionist trade policy, stricter immigration
laws, higher minimum wages and a more aggressive approach to antitrust
enforcement. He made headlines earlier this year when he described
Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan as one of the Biden
administration officials 'doing a pretty good job'...

Those kind of comments have concerned investors in particular. One top
New York dealmaker said picking Vance as vice-president 'would not be
reassuring to the business community, and could signal an anti-M&A
mindset for the second Trump administration'"

I'm glad. The event will help Biden a little taking focus off him. But
