<p>Python! üêç üêç üêç üêç (it is the language we use on this blog)</p>
<p>Github: "Remember when people said AI would replace developers? Our
data tells a different story... In 2024, Python overtook JavaScript as
the most popular language on GitHub, while Jupyter Notebooks
skyrocketed‚Äîboth of which underscore the surge in data science and
machine learning on GitHub"</p>
<hr />
<p>Non-profits are solid orgs.. Management guru Peter Drucker wrote
entire books on them. They are not paid attention to enough, all the
attention is on for-profit entities because they give the bigger
contribution to politicians (they basically own them). Non-profits
need to band together and create their own PAC otherwise for-profit
types will make an hellhole out of your country. Can't let those
fuckers run the roost.</p>
<hr />
<p>O'Nolan previously worked for Wordpress, the famous CMS platform. The
post below is timely bcz Wordpress parent co Automattic CEO Mullenweg
is apparently losing his shit, his for-profit brain is going cuckoo
damaging the WP devs and the brand in the process, so the Ghost
example is a good contrast to all that.</p>
<hr />
<p>John O'Nolan: "Non-profit structures are particularly well suited to
companies that specifically want to serve public community interests,
like schools, hospitals, local news orgs, and ‚Äî yes ‚Äî open source
projects... In the US, non-profits are heavily regulated in their
operations, and exempt from income tax...</p>
<p>[Non-profits] don't have owners. And that's what matters. People often
think that 'non-profit' means that the company can't make a profit. It
actually means that the company doesn't have any owners who can
personally take the profits. Any revenue earned can only be
reinvested.</p>
<p>Non-profit structures are particularly well suited to companies that
specifically want to serve public community interests, like schools,
hospitals, local news orgs, and ‚Äî yes ‚Äî open source
projects. Non-profit orgs still employ people and pay salaries, and
they're generally audited by the government to ensure they're
operating correctly and within reason.</p>
<p>At [non-profit publishing platform] Ghost..our annual accounts are
subject to a mandatory audit every single year. A shareholder of a
for-profit company may decide to cut costs to the detriment of the
organisation because they're motivated to increase profits and grant
themselves larger dividends at the end of the year.</p>
<p>In a company making cardboard boxes, that's no big deal. Some
short-term money will be made and then the company will probably
fail. The market adapts. In an organisation whose mission is to serve
a community, though, the effects of decisions like this often have
greater consequences.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of the non-profit structure is to protect against
this and ensure that any decisions made benefit the organisation and
its community, not its owners. Ghost has no incentive to slash costs
and drive up profits, because it has no owners. It will always be
independent.</p>
<p>The organisation exists for-purpose, rather than for-profit"</p>

<p>Govs need to invest in social infrastructure, bidness always makes use
of freely available infra e.g. educated populace, bridges, roads,
networks. Someone else needs to do the heavy lifting for them, they
only connect some "stuff on top", and create binness. We need them the
way you need cory catfish in an aquirium, but they do not
fundamentally innovate, they exploit. They are bottom feeders. But the
biz propaganda since the 80s became so extreme, they forgot the true
source of their income. They destroyed social infra and literally
killed the goose that laid golden eggs. They believed their own
bullshit.</p>
<hr />
<p>Eurodollars are dollars deposited in a U.S. bank or foreign bank
outside the US... There is a futures contract on them via CME, "the
interest [on the contract] will be paid by anyone who borrows $1
million for a potential three-month duration at the LIBOR interest
rate. It allows the trader to speculate on a future interest rate of
three months". And, ED market is extremely liquid.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lower rates at any time indicates econ trouble, econ is not heating
up, not growing, hence low rates. Low rates in the future, all the
time, forever means econ in duldrums. Good for asset prices, bad for
people. CB lowering rates more will not help, econ saw some of the
lowest rates post 2008, econ still sucks. Econ is fundamentally
broken. "Biz friendly environment" is no cure. Since 2008 US there's
been no shortage of biz friendly administrations yet the curve
flattened and flattened. People who work on shit jobs will not have
extra cash to spend, whatever they spend will go to the wealthy, or
China anyway. Redistribution is needed, direct aid on the one hand,
highly taxed wealth on the other. Money is zero-sum. Somebody needs to
lose for somebody to gain. Hammer time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Since 2008 crisis the treasury curve has been flattening, save for a
few upticks. Buying ED means betting on rate fall. There is an uptick
now but it will be followed by a fall. Expect to see negative values
by 2026.</p>
<pre><code class="python">df = u.get_fred(2008,['DGS2','DGS10'])

df['inv'] = df.DGS10 - df.DGS2

<hr />
<p>Investopedia: "The eurodollar market traces its origins to the Cold
War era of the 1950s when the Soviet Union started to move its
dollar-denominated revenue (derived from selling commodities like
crude oil) out of U.S. banks. This was done to prevent the United
States from being able to freeze its assets. Since then, eurodollars
have become one of the largest short-term money markets in the world
and their interest rates have emerged as a benchmark for corporate
funding"</p>
<hr />
<p>Due to inequality econ fundamentally cannot get better. In financial
market terms that means curve flattening.. Wanna make money on the
country's doom? Can buy a "green" Eurodollar future contract (matures
a few years ahead) and ED price is inverse of interest rate btw, you
buy for the fall. Now I understand why #Stevenson's writing tone in
his autobio is sometimes so gloomy. He came from poverty, became rich
while betting on a future that would make econ even worse for ppl who
still lived in that poverty. The ED idea is from his book.</p>

<p>You entered that BEV business and you are getting destroyed. The tech

not such a copycat.  Cascading stupidity in action. But you followed it,
now chickens have come home to roost.</p>

tried to shut us down. We protest, 8000 people in the Great March of

ammunition. We go to social media, and advocate there, we get shut
out, silenced on social media. Every single avenue - international law

peaceful avenues are pursued by Palestinians and that is never good

<p>The ethnic stuff was fine.. I started watching live US comedy in NYC,
and I've heard worse. I heard Hispanic, black, white comedians roast

<p>Informed Comment: "It took nearly a year for French President Emmanuel
Macron to confront the uncomfortable truth: the path to peace in Gaza
cannot be paved with more weapons to Israel. His recent remarks, sharp
and unapologetic, reflected the urgency of shifting away from military
escalation. 'I think that today, the priority is that we return to a
political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,'
Macron declared, laying bare his stance. He was unequivocal in his
message, adding, 'If you call for a ceasefire, it‚Äôs only consistent
that you do not supply weapons of war.'. Although Macron clarified
that France does not supply Israel with offensive arms, his pointed
comments seemed aimed at the United States, which remains Israel‚Äôs
primary arms provider"</p>

<p>Zelensk possibly wants an end to the war, his victory plans could be

<p>Today in Labor History October 24, 1947: Walt Disney testified before
the House Un-American Activities Committee, naming many of his own
employees as communists, including Herbert Sorrell, David Hilberman
and William Pomerance, because of their activism as union
organizers. In 1993, the New York Times wrote that Disney had been
passing secrets to the FBI from 1940 until his death in 1966. In
return, J. Edgar Hoover let Disney film in FBI headquarters in
Washington and made Disney a 'full Special Agent in Charge Contact.'</p>
<p>In 1971, Ariel Dorfman and Armand Mattelart published 'How to Read
Donald Duck,' a book-length essay critiquing Disney comics as
capitalist propaganda for U.S. corporate and cultural imperialism. It
