Germany will join the new hydrogen pipeline project between Spain,
Portugal and France. The project, called H2Med, will connect Portugal
and Spain with France and now Germany to supply about two million tons
of hydrogen annually, or about 10% of the European Union's hydrogen
demand, by 2030" via Deutsche Welle

TR nemesis Kurdish PKK and sister org YPG are closer to PUK - one
Talabani made a visit to Rojova (YPG stronghold in NE Syria). Barzanis
are seen as too close to Ankara, as their poodle (which makes them the
poodle to poodle's poodle).

---

KRG, Iraqi central gov also have conflicts; after KRG 2017 indep
referandum central gov attacked KRG, took 20% of its land including
Kirkuk - major oil production center.

The loss of Kirkuk then became a PUK-KDP sore spot; PUK reportedly
left the fight, KDP was gung-ho, and lost. Major loss of face for KRG
especially KDP. Papa Barzani resigned after that one.

---

Iraq Kurdish map again; two families Barzani / Talabani are feuding,
one is based at Erbil the other at Suleymaniah, + sign is Kirkuk.

Trouble in Kurdish regional gov (KRG) of Iraq. The two major parties
in it, KDP, PUK are not getting along..

TASS: "The West may be heading for 'a catastrophic stalemate,' at
best, for Ukraine, Sherelle Jacobs, head of the Online Comment at The
Daily Telegraph, wrote on Monday night.

She views a decisive Russian breakthrough in spring as an alternative
scenario. According to her, while Western elites assume that a victory
for the Ukrainians 'must surely be around the corner,' the fact is
that Ukraine is increasingly on the back foot"
 
---

If such a win *did* occur BTW the Russian state would cease to exist -
and that's not going to happen.

---

It would be very difficult in the following year, or the one after
that as well..

Newsweek: 'From a military standpoint, I still maintain that for this
year it would be very, very difficult to militarily eject the Russian
forces from...every inch of Russian-occupied Ukraine,' [CJCS] Milley
said"

North Sea by applying to the European Commission to qualify for

---

AU is a good scientist; I agree with his general stance on how
fundamental science needs to be conducted. The Standard Model needs to
go.

---

A. Unzicker is disappointed with America - his new book is called
*Make Physics Great Again*, he is blaming sci culture in US for setting
back fundamental research.

H2 Central: "Alkaline Fuel Cell Power Corp Announces Prototype Launch
of Jupiter 1.0, a Powerful Fuel Cell System for Homes and Small
Buildings..

The planet Jupiter is made up of roughly 90% hydrogen, and similarly,
this PWWR fuel cell converts hydrogen to heat and electricity at
approximately 90% efficiency. Jupiter 1.0 is built to supply power
during peak demand periods and serves as a back-up when required for
homes and small buildings...

Jupiter 1.0, requires fewer components compared to conventional fuel
cells and also eliminates the need for expensive, precious metals"

H2 Central: "Brazilian chemical maker Unigel said on Wednesday it will
invest up to $1.5 billion in its complex in the state of Bahia to
produce.. green hydrogen, the first in the country to do so on an
industrial scale... The plant, located in the city of Cama√ßari, should
have the first of three phases inaugurated by the end of 2023,
expanding capacity until it achieves production of 100,000 tonnes of
hydrogen by 2027, or 600,000 tonnes of one of its derivatives,
ammonia"

ARkStorm looks like serious shit. Read some of the scenarios - dam

---

"@weatherwest@mastodon.social

The recent storm sequence in California--as damaging, disruptive, and
(sadly) deadly as it was--is still nowhere near the severity level of
plausible events we foresee in the ARkStorm scenarios. The risks are
rising in a warming climate...and we need to prepare"

We could gauge the effectiveness of the vax (and the system delivering
it) using the 1% method. Deaths in US are 1.11 million, `1.11 /
(330*0.01)` equals 0.33 meaning 67% effectiveness.

---

Will Dr. Luigi go on trial for possibly triggering this pandemic?

---

Some nasty effin thing this virus is..

---

That would be the optimistic scenario, a lower bound. If we
[assume](../../2020/02/corona.html) overall mortality rate of 1%, the
outcome could reach over 10 million. Assume with an half effective
vax, the final number could be at about 5 mil.

MHI has tech for pure NH3 based power plants too. So many
options.. with some coal, or completely without coal.. Such are the
benefits of a solid base tech.

H2 View: "Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) is set to conduct a
feasibility study for the introduction of ammonia co-firing at a
coal-fired thermal power plant in Thailand, in pursuit of a
decarbonising power production with hydrogen-based fuels"

Fast Fashion Facts:

- We buy 60% more than we did in 2000 but each garment is kept for half as long.
- Of the billions of clothing items made each year, over half are thrown away.
- The fashion industry employs millions of people but only around 2% earn a living wage.
- 60% of clothes are made from synthetic fabrics derived from fossil fuels.
- The production of textiles produces almost 1.2 billion tonnes of CO2 per year"

Obviously, mining as a means to encourage server availability was an
obscenely stupid idea caused waste of precious energy.

---

Open social media can provide the backdrop for fantastic net-centric
apps to be developed. Bitcoin bribed miners with mined money reward so
their machines provided other services to users. OSM servers are
already available for socmed purposes anyway, will probably outnumber
miner machines pretty soon, and on that processing power many services
can be built.. Digital currency is only one example.

Really clear to me that the new web of fediverse.. is moving very
quickly towards something pretty amazing. As much promise as all the
hype of ‚ÄúWeb3‚Äù, but open, interoperable, and no ties to crypto
scams. A lot of incredible things are going to be built across this
surface area in the next few years"
