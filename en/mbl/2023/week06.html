<p>Left Voice: "Everything You Need to Know About Sahra Wagenknecht’s
'Left Conservatism'.. Die Linke has a program calling for 'open
borders.'  Wagenknecht became convinced that this — and this alone —
was why her party was losing support in the East, where it was once a
Volkspartei, a mass party.. [Her book] is a 345-page diatribe against
what she calls 'identity politics' [that] 'amounts to focusing on ever
smaller and ever more bizarre minorities, each of which finds an
identity in some quirk which distinguishes it from the majority of
society, and from which it derives the claim to victimhood'"</p>
<hr />
<p>"Die Linke politician [Wagenknecht].. is rumoured to be planning a
breakaway party.. In her bestselling book [.. she] accused Die Linke
of having neglected 'ordinary people' in favour of what she refers to
as a city-dwelling 'academic clientele'. She says its preoccupation
with issues such as 'gender-conscious language and pricey organic
products' rather than bread-and-butter issues such as 'fighting low
pay' has made it a stranger to its grassroots working-class support
base... Polls show her chances of succeeding as head of a new party to
be good... Among [right-wing] AfD voters the interest was a staggering
68%"</p>

<p>Mercedes-Benz: "At the time of this publishing, Drive Pilot's ODD
[Operational Design Domain] is limited to fully access-controlled
highways (commonly called 'freeways') up to a specific maximum
speed. (A fully access-controlled highway is defined as a divided
highway with at least two lanes of traffic in each direction that has
no intersections – only on-ramps and off-ramps.).. ODD is further
restricted according to the presence or absence of certain road
features and/or conditions, such as:</p>
<p>• Machine-detectable lane markings</p>
<p>• The absence of tunnels, toll booths and traffic control devices
(stop signs, traffic lights, etc.)</p>
<p>• Applicable legal requirements</p>
<p>The resulting ODD boundaries (including available routes) are defined
within a precise, high-definition map.  These boundaries comprise the
“geo-fence” for the area of operation of Drive Pilot; it will not
allow the driver to engage the feature, nor will the feature operate
the vehicle, outside of these boundaries"</p>
