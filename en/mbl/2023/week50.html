<li>
<p>Providing Welfare Through Warfare.. The [MIC] among other things, is
a massive federal jobs program. Between the Pentagon and private
sector military contractors and subcontractors, the sector directly or
indirectly employs nearly four million people... All of those jobs and
benefits — carefully distributed across hundreds of congressional
districts — make Pentagon spending an immediate, tangible, material
concern for millions of people. In a country where the welfare state
is notoriously threadbare and an actual federal jobs program is
perpetually off the table, 'military Keynesianism' comes to be seen as

<p>Paper: "[W]hy does range anxiety exist for BEVs’ consumers? We guess
consumers’ range anxiety mainly comes from two aspects: First, one
cause of range anxiety could be that the real range of BEVs differs
greatly from the nominal AER announced by automotive
companies. Especially when the air conditioning is on, and the battery
performance decreases in winter, it results in a lower real range. For
example, the real range of BEVs is approximately 35%–40% lower than
the nominal range (at minus 7) in cold regions of China... The
second.. anxiety is charging anxiety. It is mainly due to the
imperfect charging infrastructure, consumers’ inability to find
charging piles in time, or charging time being too long, especially
when battery charging is not on the consumers’ schedule"</p>

<p>Latest neural net based approaches in their essence get one isolated
datapoint, and one label (prediction target) per training cycle
(batching can be done but that is an implementation trick). Truly
representing, using sequence has always been a problem for NNs. In one
approach you <em>cheat</em> by taking in enough pre-sequenced data as a
snapshot. One datapoint can have, eg "cat sat on the" which is paired
with label "mat". Then shift tokens one to the right in the bigger
sentence, next isolated datapoint is "sat on the mat and" with new
label "shat". For full sentences you ask NN multiple times, with
different pieces, you get a sequenced -ish looking output, you might
get "cat sat on the mat and shat". There is no planning, no true
sequencing. One datapoint has no relation to the next. That's what I
meant previously when I said these things are, at their core,
extremely dumb.</p>

<p>Howard: "Something I think pretty much everyone..  including Yann LeCun
agrees on is LLMs aren't going to make it. They're not a path to

limitations...</p>
<p>The thing you can really see missing here is this this planning piece,
so if you try to get an LLM to solve like fairly simple graph coloring
problems, or fairly simple stacking problems, things that require
backtracking and trying things and stuff, they, unless it's seen
something pretty similar in its training, they just fail terribly...</p>

the surface, at least, Hamas seemed to back up this perceived change
with actions...</p>
<p>Was this strategy just a front while the group planned the October 7
attack? Perhaps. But Israel and the international community did not
make a major shift in their policies in response to Hamas’s
moderation. There were limited economic concessions and statements
acknowledging Hamas’s role in governing Gaza. At the same time, there
was incendiary far-right political rhetoric and rising levels of
violence against Palestinians. Both 2021 and 2022 set records as the
