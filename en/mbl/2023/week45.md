"Ex-UN official: Palestine-Israel two-state solution 'a joke‚Äô at UN"

This reminds me words like "Palestenians never lose an opportunity to
lose an opportunity", "it's complex" or "their grandfathers kicked out
our grandfathers, now we are back".

---

Yeah. Give them billions in aid that makes them want peace less, than
wash your hands off it with a slick little observation. Nice one
Kerry. You were for it before you were against it.

Al-Monitor: "[Kerry 2014, on ISR/PAL conflict] We can't want peace
more than they do"

Ridiculous

BBC: "Rashida Tlaib censured over Israel-Gaza comments.. The US
Congress has voted to censure its only Palestinian-American member
over comments she made on the Israel-Gaza war. Michigan Democrat
Rahida Tlaib was rebuked for her defence of the chant "from the river
to the sea, Palestine will be free".

The resolution formally condemned her for 'calling for the destruction
of the state of Israel'. The measure passed by 234 to 188
votes. Twenty-two Democrats voted to censure"

Arab News: "Hundreds of pro-Palestinian protesters calling for a
cease-fire in Gaza blocked traffic Monday at the Port of Tacoma, where
a military supply ship had recently arrived. Organizers said they
opposed the Israel-Hamas war and targeted the vessel -the Cape
Orlando- based on confidential information that it was to be loaded
with weapons bound for Israel"

- wrongness generator 3000 (uses more energy than a small nation)

- fraud

- space pollution

- self-crashing cars

- an app that is actually criminally underpaid workers in another country

- an app that is actually criminally underpaid workers in this country

AA: "[2020] Increased air pollution in Afghanistan in recent years
reportedly killed more people than the current civil war in the
country, according to officials... [Researcher] said sub-standard fuel
is used in [AFG]... 'Air pollution has further increased as thousands
of families in Kabul started to use plastic, car tires and raw coal in
their stoves as the temperature drops,'".

---

Big cities in Asia are polluted why Kabul in AFG? Their CO, PM 2.5 is
off the charts.

Surprising fact: no major professional scientific organization has
flipped from a paywalled publishing model to 100% Open Access.

The @ACM the world's foremost professional computing organization, is
going to be the first on January 1, 2026, when its entire digital
library will become freely available to the public"

Ars Technica: "[W]hen evidence emerged in the early 1970s about the
health effects of indoor nitrogen dioxide exposure from gas stove use,
the American Gas Association launched a campaign designed to
manufacture doubt about the existing science. As a researcher who
has¬†studied air pollution for many years‚Äîincluding gas stoves‚Äô
contribution to indoor air pollution and health effects‚ÄîI am not na√Øve
about the strategies that some industries use to¬†avoid or delay
regulations. But I was surprised to learn that the multipronged
strategy related to gas stoves directly mirrored tactics that the
tobacco industry used to¬†undermine and distort scientific evidence¬†of
health risks associated with smoking starting in the 1950s"

Same pattern appears everywhere; academia discovers, private sector
turns it into product. Private sector cannot perform basic research.

Without the free the commercial cannot exist.

The Guardian: "When a microbe was found munching on a plastic bottle
in a rubbish dump, it promised a recycling revolution. Now scientists
are attempting to turbocharge those powers in a bid to solve our waste
crisis.. [I]n 2001, a group of Japanese scientists [from Kyoto
Institute of Technology and the Keio University] made a startling
discovery at a rubbish dump. In trenches packed with dirt and waste,
they found a slimy film of bacteria that had been happily chewing
through plastic bottles, toys and other bric-a-brac... [S]ince 2021, a
French company named Carbios has been running an operation that uses a
bacterial enzyme to process about 250kg of PET plastic waste every
day, breaking it down into its precursor molecules"

I always find it funny when getting into arguments with libertarians
and they're like 'The profit motive is great. See? Look at my phone'
and my response is 'Dude... I've written some of the code that's
running on your phone, and I did it for free. It's a device built on
open standards and the unpaid labour of 100,000 unpaid nerds. You are
not making the argument that you think you're making'"

Cosmos Mag: "The race to produce cheap green hydrogen has a new and
serious competitor with India announcing a suite of green hydrogen
plans..  The Green Hydrogen Policy put out by the Ministry of New and
Renewable Energy (MNRE) envisages the production of 10 million tons of
green hydrogen by 2030 with half of that being used as a substitute
for fossil fuels in transport and in the hard to abate industrial
sectors.  The other 5 million tons would be earmarked for
export... [N]umerous private firms such as Reliance, Adani, ReNew
Power and L&T [are] lining up for a piece of the action. Reliance
wants to produce green hydrogen for $USD1 a kg by 2030. Ten states led
by Gujarat, but including Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala, have also
been identified as potential production hubs"

The Telegraph: "Hydrogen plan could save taxpayer '¬£5bn a year' more
than heat pumps.. A study has found that using 'hydrogen-ready'
boilers could cost billions less as ministers are urged not to shut
down UK gas network"

Hedges: "Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated on Nov. 4, 1995 by a
Jewish fanatic. Rabin‚Äôs widow, Lehea, blamed Netanyahu and his
supporters for her husband‚Äôs murder... Netanyahu, who first became
prime minister in 1996, has spent his political career nurturing
Jewish extremists.. His father, Benzion ‚Äî who worked as an assistant
to the Zionist pioneer Vladimir Jabotinsky, who Benito Mussolini
referred to as 'a good fascist' ‚Äî was a leader in the Herut Party that
called on the Jewish state to seize all the land of historic
Palestine"

Non-tech, manager level folk mostly do not have an ability to judge
tech on its own merits. They look at "connections", who is connected
to who, if a person in the chain says a tech is good, they'll jump in
the FOMO. Occasionally morons sneak in the chain, which screws
everything (look at how battery electric cars became prevalent) if you
talk to the wrong people you end up a pea puffer, not a shark. Ask
O'Conned.

Attended by Clinton, Blair, Buttafuoco, Kevin O'Conned.. Their rep
