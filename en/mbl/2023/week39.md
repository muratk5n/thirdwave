Reuters: "UK and Germany partner to further advance hydrogen
developments... A new important agreement between the UK and Germany
could help to accelerate the development of an international hydrogen
industry..  Signed at the UK Embassy in Berlin.. a Joint Declaration
of Intent will see the UK and Germany work together to underpin the
international trade in hydrogen...

The partnership follows significant investment by both countries in
the development of hydrogen as an alternative fuel. In the UK, the
government is supporting new low-carbon hydrogen production with
capital from the £240 million Net Zero Hydrogen Fund and revenue
support from the Hydrogen Production Business Model"

F24: "With fentanyl, the cartels no longer needed to grow opium or
rely on rural communities to produce it. Fentanyl is lightweight,
discreet and easy to produce and transport. It can be passed off as a

overdoses. Just one fentanyl tablet can kill – and it's doing so
increasingly frequently around the American continent"

America, and anyone who has ever moved into a new house or apartment
knows that it’s never the case that all six are an option. The
telecoms have carved up the country, giving the impression of many
nationwide players while running a near-monopoly virtually
everywhere. According to a comprehensive 2018 study of the telecom
industry’s broadband deployment, Comcast and Charter.. are the only
internet service providers for 68 million people in their networks.

Yes all that S-400 drama.. After months of "will they, won't they"
S-400 was bought, but then was sent to a depot never to be used again,
because the subsequent punishment for the act would be
severe. Pedestrian watcher of the drama remembers the drama, not the
aftermath, which might have been the purpose from the
start. "Rebelliousness" was on display for as long as possible, but
led nowhere. This is poodle territory.

---

Homie was kicked out of the F-35 program, looking at this situation maybe
that was not so bad.

---

It sounds like the fault lies with the private sector again.

Defense News: "In March 2023, [Government Accountability Office] said,
the mission-capable rate for all F-35s was at 55%. That's well below
the 70% mission-capable goal the Air Force..

The backlog of broken spare parts that need fixed has more than
doubled since spring 2019, GAO said, from 4,300 to more than
10,000... Rather than wait nearly five months for a repaired
part.. the F-35 Joint Program Office often buys new parts at a higher
cost. This helps get the fighter back in the air faster.. but it
drives up sustainment costs..

[S]upport equipment frequently breaks.. and because it is proprietary,
contractors must come in to fix it — a process that can take
months. In the last few years, the F-35 program has grown to conclude
it can’t afford the current strategy of contractor-led sustainment of
the jet. By 2036, GAO wrote in a 2021 report, contractor-led
sustainment of the jet will be $6 billion more than the military can
afford in that year alone..

Decisions made at the dawn of the F-35 are.. coming back to haunt it —
particularly the Pentagon’s early decision not to obtain technical
data on the fighter from Lockheed Martin"

LOL Rupert Murdoch's resignation letter rails against 'the elites.'"

---

Notice the frequent use of "the elites" label in right-wing media,
they are trying to create that feudal connection perhaps, elite =
government = ruler = king so you ask them to "stay out of your room".

---

I'm sure the post-70s grand bargain, neoliberal agenda and its
planners preyed upon such base feelings when they pushed their
anti-government message. You can always equate government = ruler =
king, therefore gov would be told "stay out of my room"

---

Rapaille, *TCC*: "Our adolescence stems from one essential point: we
never had to kill the king in order to become who we are.  Every adult
was once a child, small and anxious. Then they go through stages of
adolescence and rebellion. In the American culture, however, our
rebellion took an unusual form. Many cultures act out their rebellion
by killing their leaders (for example, the French rebelled by
beheading Louis XVI), after which their period of rebellion ends and
adulthood begins. We never killed our king because we never actually
had one. We rebelled against the only king who ever tried to rule us
and threw him out of 'our room,' but we didn’t behead him. We simply
told him to stay out.

For this reason, our rebellious period never really ended. Rather than
moving on from it, we hold on to it and reinforce it when we welcome
immigrants to our shores. These immigrants have left the country that
was forced upon them at birth.  Coming here is a huge act of
rebellion. Like the American revolutionaries, they leave their old
cultures behind rather than “finishing the job” by killing the
king. Therefore, they remain rebels, and this constant influx of new
adolescents helps keep our entire culture adolescent"

---

America has a bizarre relationship with its government. Some reactions
to it are downright childish.. Clotaire Rapaille hints it could be due
to how America dealt with its former feudal ruler. See above.

---

Being able to transact fast, easily was certainly lacking then, and it
still does now (FED is finally rolling out a solution), but the reason
for that backwardness *again* had to do with finance, business
community itself who never wanted government to be involved in
anything other than keeping the banking system solvent (read: bail me
out when I need it) and frowned upon actions that looked remotely
innovative by the government, bcz like, that was "their turf". Gov on
its part frowned upon money transfer outside its bailiwick bcz of the
need to deal with money laundering, crime (that's why they killed
Libra). The result: deadlock, and the freak shitcoins emerged out of
that lull in policymaking.

In China, and India, where corporatism (fascism) is not as strong as
in US, governments could innovate, lead others to implement a fast
money transfer solution. Have no doubt, Indian UPI is ten times better
and reliable than any of these fuckcoins, it likely provided a good
example for US FED to follow as well. US was late in the game, wasting
time with "fintech", while India steamed ahead.

---

Quick reminder Bitcoin started during the aftermath of GFC, along with
the "Tea Party" movement who thought the solution for unfettered
capitalism was more unfettered capitalism (you can transact without
government fiat bro). That's why they kept the money base to be finite
as they were mimicking gold, a "politics free money" bcz they are
bufoons without any shred of econ knowledge.
