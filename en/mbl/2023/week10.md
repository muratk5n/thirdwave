# Week 10


In regular business ppl compete, excesses can be handled at the
courts.. Guy stepping over your IP, sue. But drug cartels are by
definition outside the law; so conflicts are handled by the gun. In
Tijuana they fight over access to trade routes, supply, manpower..
It's business. Regular people are caught in the crossfire.

---

Right across the border from Tijuana is San Diego; US has demand,
money, Mexico has product. Narcotics is an extremely [high-margin](0119/2017/07/the-next-decade-friedman.html#drugs)
business, product is easy to produce, and not fragile like electronics,
once certain hurdles are overcome, u could even catapult it over the wall
from Tijuana to San Diego. So high demand check, ease of production check,
-physically speaking- easy to transport check.

Then the product is made illegal. How could this backdrop not lead to
rampant violence?

---

Media calls the new police chief in Tijuana "Mexico's Rambo"... They
like these catchy phrases.. But the general environment is not
favorable for the chief.

The scheme is also open for cheating; companies can take their carbon
from anywhere do some shady biz just like Volkswagen in 2009-2015. And
guess which company is pushing for e-fuels the most.

Reuters: "E-fuels are made using CO2 captured from the atmosphere and
hydrogen extracted with renewable electricity, and can be used in any
conventional combustion engine. While they do release CO2 from the
tailpipe, it's just releasing what was captured in creating them,
hence the claim to carbon neutrality.. [But] carbon offsetting won't
do anything to reduce the pollution and health effects caused by
tailpipe emissions"

Seymour Hersh: "[W]hy did much of the secret planning and training for
the [Nord Stream sabotage] operation take place in Norway?  And why
were highly skilled seamen and technicians from the Norwegian Navy

murky history of cooperation with American intelligence"

NWG folk have a little chip on their shoulder don't they? Beaten down
by neighboring nations in the past, maybe this is how they 'stand out'
now, by being a jagoff. Plus, per the Nordstream sabotage (which
allegedly they took a major part in), they had an economic interests
in Russian gas flow to Europe being disrupted.

Yahoo News: "Zelensky warned in an interview with CNN what could
happen if Bakhmut falls to Russian forces. 'We understand that after
Bakhmut, (Russian forces) could go further' and attack nearby cities
in the Donetsk region. 'They could go to Kramatorsk, they could go to
Sloviansk, it would be an open road for the Russians after Bakhmut to
other towns in Ukraine, in the Donetsk direction,' Zelensky said in an
interview"

---

RU could be aiming for the bigger cauldron, not just the Bakhmut one,
there is movement towards Chasiv Yar, and the claim is
Orikhovo-Vasylivka is also under attack or taken. UA keeps sending
reinforcements to the area so they can end up with a huge number of
people trapped in that larger cauldron.

Reuters: "At right-wing CPAC forum, Trump shows why he'll be tough to
topple.. Reminders of former U.S. President Donald Trump’s towering
influence over the Republican Party were everywhere at the annual
Conservative Political Action Conference this weekend near Washington.
There were kiosks hawking Trump hats and shirts, attendees sporting
'Make America Great Again' stickers and even a mock Oval Office where
attendees could be photographed next to Trump’s picture. The three-day
conference illustrated the iron grip he holds over the right-wing,
grassroots base of his party and how hard it could be for a challenger
to deny Trump the Republican presidential nomination in 2024"

Netan went sour on that remark

facility is illegal.. [he] was initially referring to Ukraine’s
Zaporizhzhia plant, which has come under repeated attack amid the
Russian invasion, with Moscow receiving increasing military backing
from Tehran. However, asked about threats by Israel and the United
States to target Iran’s nuclear sites, Grossi said that the principle
stood for all nuclear facilities around the world"

GPM is a useful measure for long-term investors, Buffett likes it, no?
I can see why, the measure shows the fundamentals, what it takes to
generate revenue. Above certain threshold, a clear up-trend can
indicate a rosy future; the indirect stuff can be dealt with as
needed.

---

The high GPM is typical of a software company with a commanding lead
in the market place as GPM shows direct costs for creating a product.
Software companies don't typically spend too much to produce,
especially once the core product / platform is mature, likely the case
for SF by now. But if there are a lot of extra, indirect spending,
fluff investments it can hurt OPM, PM.
