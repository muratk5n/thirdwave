üëç Some "communities" are rather well-represented here [on
Mastodon]... basically every notable blogger from the year 2005 is
here!.. üòÇ Meanwhile, it's kinda funny how crypto people are entirely
absent in the Fediverse, given their professed love of
decentralization. (Perhaps they were not not so much into
decentralization but rather recentralization of wealth around
themselves!)"

Netan went sour on that remark

The Times of Israel: "[Grossi] Any military attack on a nuclear
facility is illegal.. [he] was initially referring to Ukraine‚Äôs
Zaporizhzhia plant, which has come under repeated attack amid the
Russian invasion, with Moscow receiving increasing military backing
from Tehran. However, asked about threats by Israel and the United
States to target Iran‚Äôs nuclear sites, Grossi said that the principle
stood for all nuclear facilities around the world"

GPM is a useful measure for long-term investors, Buffett likes it, no?
I can see why, the measure shows the fundamentals, what it takes to
generate revenue. Above certain threshold, a clear up-trend can
indicate a rosy future; the indirect stuff can be dealt with as
needed.

---

The high GPM is typical of a software company with a commanding lead
in the market place as GPM shows direct costs for creating a product.
Software companies don't typically spend too much to produce,
especially once the core product / platform is mature, likely the case
for SF by now. But if there are a lot of extra, indirect spending,
fluff investments it can hurt OPM, PM.

Guidance for op profit margin was for ~10% and the stock soared?
Buyers must have seen some hope in Salesforce (great stock ticker
name, "CRM")

Yahoo Finance: "Salesforce Inc. surged by the most in almost three
years after raising its forecast for profit margins.. At least five
activist investors, including Elliott and Starboard Value, are pushing
the company to cut costs following a half-decade of aggressive hiring
and large acquisitions.

H2 Central: "There‚Äôs Hydrogen In Them There Hills: The Trailblazers
Mining for ‚ÄòGold Hydrogen‚Äô..  The cost of extracting hydrogen from the
ground is potentially very cheap compared with existing methods. One
deposit in Mali, which is at a relatively shallow depth and produces
nearly pure hydrogen, could be tapped for 50 U.S. cents per kg"

said it plans to make 60% of its hydrogen green by 2025, which would
equate to 2.1 million tonnes of green hydrogen a year"

Russian is in the Indo-European family

---

It's crazy, the homeland includes all the regions being fought over
right now, an area that is the origin of a part of the Eastern and
Western Eurasian culture.

---

Apparently the geo origin of Indo-European languages was an open
question - recently answered, confirming the earlier share with
Kristiansen.
