Apparently SB and its Signet allowed the hyper growth of FTX, without
it they would have remained much smaller. Crypto ppl talk big game
about upending the system but they needed a connection to the
backbone, to the existing system through a bank. They found a few
gullable ones, used them, esp SB with its fast Signet along with money
launderers, criminals. 

Yahoo Finance: "A class-action lawsuit was filed against Signature
Bank in February, alleging the bank knew about ‚Äì and facilitated ‚Äì the
'now infamous FTX fraud.' Specifically, the suit accuses Signature
Bank of having knowledge of and permitting 'the commingling of [the
FTX exchange's] customer funds within its proprietary,
blockchain-based payments network, Signet'"

If a near-future version of Trek is done, I'd want an Android there
called "Meme" instead of "Data". This character would be a clownish,
overly creative twat, all he does, all day long is generating memes;
just spouts one meme after another. TNG's Data was smart with
human-like strong AI, strived to learn art.. Meme has art but is
extremely dumb just like the modern "AI" algorithms today, but tries
to become smart. Meme acquiring an iota of intelligence in each
episode will be his character arc. At the end of 10 seasons he'll be
able to read text, summarize it, and drive a car.

Politico: "[I]n 1792, Congress passed the Post Office Act. Publishers
would be charged 1 cent for most newspapers and 1.5 cents for those
traveling more than 100 miles. This amounted to an enormous
subsidy. Rates for regular letters ranged from 6 cents to 25 cents,
depending on the distance. The postmaster in 1794 estimated that
newspapers constituted 70 percent of the mail while kicking in about 4
percent of the revenue. Postage paid by publishers defrayed no more
than 12-14 percent of costs, concluded Richard Kielbowicz in News in
the Mail. Scholar Robert McChesney has estimated that 'if the
U.S. government subsidized journalism today at the same level of GDP
that it did in the 1840s, the government would have to spend in the
neighborhood of $30-35 billion annually.' That‚Äôs about the size of
NASA‚Äôs budget"

Dr. Ekberg: "I don't see any reason to ever buy store-bought juice
because it has to be pasteurized in order to be sold in a store and
now you're destroying most of the benefits.  Most of the enzymes.. the
phyto-factors, polyphenols and whatever else might be in that juice
you're destroying it with that pasteurization, so when you put a big
red X on that because all you're really getting now is sugar water.

Yeah it's a little bit better than Coca-Cola, but not a whole lot.
Orange juice is about 8% sugar.  Apple juices about 10% sugar. So if
you have a cup you're already getting about 25 grams of
sugar. Absolutely not a good idea for any of these protocols no matter
what your goal is for weight loss or reducing insulin resistance stay
away from store-bought juice"

BTW can enough carbon be captured from the air for all efuel needs? If
they cut bunch of trees burn them to obtain "neutral carbon" (trees
took it from the air, putting it back is sort of "neutral") then
that's not a good path. Hopefully pure H2 usage is encouraged more.
