This book is great work, every page is full of useful information.

Anderson, *Evil Geniuses*: "Ever easier borrowing was the fundamental
change that allowed the financial industry to take over more and more
of people’s lives and ever more of the economy. 'I think we hit the
jackpot,' President Reagan kvelled in 1982 as he signed one of the
first big financial deregulation laws, which the Democratic House had
passed by three to one... In 1978 the credit card business became much
more attractive thanks to a Supreme Court decision that allowed banks
to charge credit card interest rates as high as they wanted..

That 1980s wave of financial industry laissez-faire helped trigger a
disaster immediately.. America’s S&Ls collapsed in less than a decade,
and the government had to provide the equivalent of a quarter-trillion
dollars to make good on their losses.. Money got easy for people in
the middle and toward the bottom, for suckers with credit card and
mortgage payments they could barely afford—but also, of course, for
people at the top, the financial speculators and middlemen who had
other innovating to do.  Such as leveraged buyouts of companies, or
LBOs..

Companies are supposed to borrow money in order to grow their
businesses.. The whole point of a modern LBO, however, is quite often
not the business as a business at all.. The federal tax provision that
makes LBOs work is shockingly simple: income is taxable, but interest
payments are deductible on tax returns, so when you start using almost
all of the LBO’d company’s income to make interest payments, you get
to stop paying corporate taxes. Of course, that’s a perversion of the
tax code, given that Congress makes interest deductible so that
businesses can more easily expand and hire and prosper.. [but] what
often happens with LBO’d companies is the opposite: in order to afford
their huge interest payments on their huge new loans, they lay off
employees, sell whatever they can, cut research and development"

Chevron made life a living hell for the environmental lawyer Steven
Donziger let's remember.. Donziger kicked their ass in Ecuador making
them pay for the pollution in an area known as the "Amazon Chernobyl",
then corporate backlash started. Donziger was sued in NY via RICO,
judge presiding is known as a "Chevron judge" (he held mutual funds
that held shares of Chevron which he did not disclose), SD ended up
being disbarred. Then further prosecution followed, the Chevron judge
asked *a private law firm* to do dirty deed, the judge for that was
not chosen randomly, Chevron judge chose some right-wing nut from the
libertard Federalist Society to which Chevron regularly contributes
money. Donziger was placed in house arrest, finally released some time
later but he truly went through the wringer.

western Ukraine... [During Maidan] U.S. Assistant Secretary of State

Design Boom: "Euro Airship is developing Solar Airship One, a
whale-shaped aircraft that plans to fly around more than 25 countries
for 20 days without stopping using solar power and hydrogen. Its plan
to take off in 2026 is looming, and the team is hustling to make sure
that the first non-stop world tour flight without fossil fuels will
meet its deadline. Euro Airship believes that its aircraft will be
flying without any noise, fossil fuel, or carbon emissions..

The aircraft, powered by solar and hydrogen, is expected to be 151
meters long with a rigid airship and a helium expansion volume of
53,000 m3. Almost its entire surface will be covered with 4,800 m2 of
solar film to fully capture sunlight. By day, it collects the sun’s
energy; by night, the surplus electricity is stored in fuel cells that
produce hydrogen via water electrolysis"

"In *The EV Transition Explained* (published by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers), Robert Charette reports that
charging an electrical vehicle (EV) can overheat a transformer—and
shorten its typically 30-to-40-year lifespan to three
years. (Transformers reduce electricity’s voltage when it’s
transmitted from a substation to a residence or business; above-ground
transformers look like trash cans mounted on utility poles.) When I
shared Charette’s report with an LA friend, he told me that the
underground transformer 50 feet from his house exploded last April on
a Saturday morning—a time he considered low-demand for electricity.

'Is it low-demand,' I wondered, 'if a handful of neighbors charge
their vehicles Friday night?'..

Different batteries have different constructs and chemistry. Tesla
batteries are held together by 'an almost indestructible polyurethane
cement.' Nissan’s Leaf battery can take two hours to
dismantle. Recycling batteries can release toxins and pose fire
hazards. By 2035, we’ll have 150 million unusable, toxic EV batteries"

"I’ve read about lithium extraction’s prodigious water use in
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Tibet—and at the U.S.’s first lithium mine,
in Silver Peak, Nevada. In 2017, research led me to Lithium Americas
Corporation’s (LAC’s) plan to turn part of the Great Basin—a
biodiverse and exquisite ecosystem between Boise and Reno known as
Thacker Pass—into an industrial extraction zone stretching over more
than 17,000 acres. Thacker Pass holds the U.S.’s largest known lithium
deposits. The corporation’s open pit alone would cover two square
miles in the mine’s first stage, and it could triple in size. Tailings
piles, processing facilities and treatments ponds would sprawl across
yet more land. The mine would burn 11,000 gallons of diesel fuel per
day and rely on more than 75 semi-truck loads of sulfur (oil refinery
waste) to process the ore. It would consume and pollute more than 1.5
billion gallons of water per year, dropping water tables and
potentially drying out fourteen springs"

Initially, the existing UAE-Saudi-Amman rail network with construction
of additional 300 km of network connecting Amman with port Haifa,

dividends from this project, it is willing to finance the remaining
stretch of 300 km on a priority basis. The network will support the
seamless movement of goods under a digital and single trade document,
harmonised transport rules and will be far cheaper operationally than
the Suez Canal route, considering its high charges for vessel towing,
tug-boat services, pilotage,transit fee etc"

New Atlas: "Researchers have used a low-emissions method to harvest
hydrogen and graphene from waste plastics... 'When we first discovered
flash Joule heating and applied it to upcycle waste plastic into
graphene, we observed a lot of volatile gases being produced and
shooting out of the reactor,' [lead researcher at Rice U project] Wyss
said. “We wondered what they were, suspecting a mix of small
hydrocarbons and hydrogen, but lacked the instrumentation to study
their exact composition'.

After acquiring the equipment needed to analyze the vaporized contents
thanks to funding from the US Army Corps of Engineers, the researchers
found their suspicions were correct: the process produced hydrogen
gas"

PV Mag: "Fortescue Future Industries’ planned facility, officially

ammonia per year, which would be used for both domestic use and
export. The USD 2 billion ($3.11b) ‘Project Coyote’ would need 1,000
MW of power from BC Hydro to create the green hydrogen by
electrolysis, which would then be processed into green ammonia"

Of course the Oslo Accords was flawed, it was a Clinton plan

Informed Comment: "30 Years after Arafat-Rabin Handshake, clear Flaws
in Oslo Accords doomed peace Talks to Failure... Thirty years later,
it is clear the Oslo Accords have achieved neither peace nor a
two-state solution. So far in 2023 alone, over 200 Palestinians and
nearly 30 Israelis have been killed. Israel has the most right-wing,
nationalist government in its history..

[T]he Oslo peace process failed because the framework itself was
deeply flawed in three key ways. First, it ignored the power imbalance
between the two sides. Second, it focused on ending violence by
Palestinian militant groups while overlooking acts of violence
committed by the Israeli state. And third, it sought peace as the end
goal, rather than justice.

J. Geuter: "I have argued for a while that I see the current LLM craze
as a bit of a weird path of innovation. Neural networks can do certain
things very well. Like for example reducing heterogenous input data
from the real world down to a limited model suitable for algorithms to
work on. They can be an interface level to glue software/hardware to
the chaos that is physics and people. But a lot of the actual things
we want to do need to be deterministic, testable, verifiable,
auditable. So the future of that space lies probably more in smaller,
focused models that give certain guarantees with regards to fault
tolerance and quality that then will be used as building blocks to
build often very traditional software on. That will enable us to use
these statistical systems for the things they can do while allowing us
to build proper systems for the things they cannot"

Hickel: "When essential goods are privatized and expensive, people
need more income than they would otherwise require to access them. To
get it they are compelled to increase their labour in capitalist
markets, working to produce new things that may not be needed (with
increased energy use, resource use, and ecological pressure) simply to
access things that clearly are needed, and which are quite often
already there.

Take housing, for example. If your rent goes up, you suddenly have to
work more just to keep the same roof over your head.  At an
economy-wide level, this dynamic means we need more aggregate
production — more growth — in order to meet basic needs.  From the
perspective of capital, this ensures a steady flow of labour for
private firms, and maintains downward pressure on wages to facilitate
capital accumulation. For the rest of us it means needless
exploitation, insecurity, and ecological damage"

How to write a "[app] serverless recommender" (movies, songs).
Tranmismitting the whole ratings database to the browser would be
slow. But you could cluster all users' movie ratings beforehand, and
send the browser only the cluster centers. User code then finds its
similarity to a cluster (10-20 of them) which should run fast, and
starts asking for the users in that cluster piece-by-piece, in small
chunks, uses their top ratings for its recommendations.

There you go - no complicated server structure, "cloud", only static
files. Good stuff eh?

Now NYT picked up on the story - the broken nature of the Standard
Model is reaching a wider audience.

NYT: "[09/02] The Story of Our Universe May Be Starting to Unravel..
According to the standard model, which is the basis for essentially
all research in [cosmology], there is a fixed and precise sequence of
events that followed the [supposed] Big Bang.. The Webb data, though,
revealed that some very large galaxies formed really fast, in too
short a time, at least according to the standard model. This was no
minor discrepancy. The finding is akin to parents and their children
appearing in a story when the grandparents are still children
themselves...

Two serious issues with the standard model of cosmology would be
concerning enough. But the model has already been patched up numerous
times over the past half century to better conform with the best
available data — alterations that may well be necessary and correct,
but which, in light of the problems we are now confronting, could
strike a skeptic as a bit too convenient...

Physicists and astronomers are starting to get the sense that
something may be really wrong. It’s not just that some of us believe
we might have to rethink the standard model of cosmology; we might
also have to change the way we think about some of the most basic
features of our universe — a conceptual revolution that would have
implications far beyond the world of science"
