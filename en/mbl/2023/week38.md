Financial Post: "VW lays off workers at key EV factory over cratering
demand"

---

"In *The EV Transition Explained* (published by the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers), Robert Charette reports that
charging an electrical vehicle (EV) can overheat a transformer—and
shorten its typically 30-to-40-year lifespan to three
years. (Transformers reduce electricity’s voltage when it’s
transmitted from a substation to a residence or business; above-ground
transformers look like trash cans mounted on utility poles.) When I
shared Charette’s report with an LA friend, he told me that the
underground transformer 50 feet from his house exploded last April on
a Saturday morning—a time he considered low-demand for electricity.

'Is it low-demand,' I wondered, 'if a handful of neighbors charge
their vehicles Friday night?'..

Different batteries have different constructs and chemistry. Tesla
batteries are held together by 'an almost indestructible polyurethane
cement.' Nissan’s Leaf battery can take two hours to
dismantle. Recycling batteries can release toxins and pose fire
hazards. By 2035, we’ll have 150 million unusable, toxic EV batteries"

"I’ve read about lithium extraction’s prodigious water use in
Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Tibet—and at the U.S.’s first lithium mine,
in Silver Peak, Nevada. In 2017, research led me to Lithium Americas
Corporation’s (LAC’s) plan to turn part of the Great Basin—a
biodiverse and exquisite ecosystem between Boise and Reno known as
Thacker Pass—into an industrial extraction zone stretching over more
than 17,000 acres. Thacker Pass holds the U.S.’s largest known lithium
deposits. The corporation’s open pit alone would cover two square
miles in the mine’s first stage, and it could triple in size. Tailings
piles, processing facilities and treatments ponds would sprawl across
yet more land. The mine would burn 11,000 gallons of diesel fuel per
day and rely on more than 75 semi-truck loads of sulfur (oil refinery
waste) to process the ore. It would consume and pollute more than 1.5
billion gallons of water per year, dropping water tables and
potentially drying out fourteen springs"

Businessline: "The India-Middle East-Europe Corridor rail-sea link
will provide strategic, economic gains for India and member
nations.. The expected cost of the proposed corridor will be $20
billion on laying a dedicated rail network, contiguously supported by
state of art optical fibre network and a hydrogen pipeline.

Initially, the existing UAE-Saudi-Amman rail network with construction
of additional 300 km of network connecting Amman with port Haifa,
Israel will be operationalised. As the UAE foresee rich business
dividends from this project, it is willing to finance the remaining
stretch of 300 km on a priority basis. The network will support the
seamless movement of goods under a digital and single trade document,
harmonised transport rules and will be far cheaper operationally than
the Suez Canal route, considering its high charges for vessel towing,
tug-boat services, pilotage,transit fee etc"

New Atlas: "Researchers have used a low-emissions method to harvest
hydrogen and graphene from waste plastics... 'When we first discovered
flash Joule heating and applied it to upcycle waste plastic into
graphene, we observed a lot of volatile gases being produced and
shooting out of the reactor,' [lead researcher at Rice U project] Wyss
said. “We wondered what they were, suspecting a mix of small
hydrocarbons and hydrogen, but lacked the instrumentation to study
their exact composition'.

After acquiring the equipment needed to analyze the vaporized contents
thanks to funding from the US Army Corps of Engineers, the researchers
found their suspicions were correct: the process produced hydrogen
gas"

PV Mag: "Fortescue Future Industries’ planned facility, officially
proposed at the Willow Cale Industrial Park in Prince George, should
produce roughly 140,000 tonnes of hydrogen and 700,000 tonnes of
ammonia per year, which would be used for both domestic use and
export. The USD 2 billion ($3.11b) ‘Project Coyote’ would need 1,000
MW of power from BC Hydro to create the green hydrogen by
electrolysis, which would then be processed into green ammonia"

Of course the Oslo Accords was flawed, it was a Clinton plan

Informed Comment: "30 Years after Arafat-Rabin Handshake, clear Flaws
in Oslo Accords doomed peace Talks to Failure... Thirty years later,
it is clear the Oslo Accords have achieved neither peace nor a
two-state solution. So far in 2023 alone, over 200 Palestinians and
nearly 30 Israelis have been killed. Israel has the most right-wing,
nationalist government in its history..

[T]he Oslo peace process failed because the framework itself was
deeply flawed in three key ways. First, it ignored the power imbalance
between the two sides. Second, it focused on ending violence by
Palestinian militant groups while overlooking acts of violence
committed by the Israeli state. And third, it sought peace as the end
goal, rather than justice.

"@gdeihl@spore.social

Pretending metals such as lithium are going to sustain our indulgent
Global North lifestyles is a sham. Batteries depend on mining copper,
nickel, cobalt and rare minerals as well, in lands where we exploit
human beings. Metals and minerals will never adequately replace the
bubble that was fossil fuels, anyhow, and mining will beget yet more
environmental harm... Those who say there are endless metals and
minerals wish to mine our dying oceans as well, for profit, not
humanity. It’s a sham, so billionaires can become
trillionaires. Mining causes enormous ecological destruction.. drains
and pollutes precious groundwater even as historic drought
increases. One metric ton of lithium requires 500,000 gallons of water
to process"

J. Geuter: "I have argued for a while that I see the current LLM craze
as a bit of a weird path of innovation. Neural networks can do certain
things very well. Like for example reducing heterogenous input data
from the real world down to a limited model suitable for algorithms to
work on. They can be an interface level to glue software/hardware to
the chaos that is physics and people. But a lot of the actual things
we want to do need to be deterministic, testable, verifiable,
auditable. So the future of that space lies probably more in smaller,
focused models that give certain guarantees with regards to fault
tolerance and quality that then will be used as building blocks to
build often very traditional software on. That will enable us to use
these statistical systems for the things they can do while allowing us
to build proper systems for the things they cannot"

Hickel: "When essential goods are privatized and expensive, people
need more income than they would otherwise require to access them. To
get it they are compelled to increase their labour in capitalist
markets, working to produce new things that may not be needed (with
increased energy use, resource use, and ecological pressure) simply to
access things that clearly are needed, and which are quite often
already there.

Take housing, for example. If your rent goes up, you suddenly have to
work more just to keep the same roof over your head.  At an
economy-wide level, this dynamic means we need more aggregate
production — more growth — in order to meet basic needs.  From the
perspective of capital, this ensures a steady flow of labour for
private firms, and maintains downward pressure on wages to facilitate
capital accumulation. For the rest of us it means needless
exploitation, insecurity, and ecological damage"

Clustering methods are unsupervised, learning with labels (what most

How to write a "[app] serverless recommender" (movies, songs).
Tranmismitting the whole ratings database to the browser would be
slow. But you could cluster all users' movie ratings beforehand, and
send the browser only the cluster centers. User code then finds its
similarity to a cluster (10-20 of them) which should run fast, and
starts asking for the users in that cluster piece-by-piece, in small
chunks, uses their top ratings for its recommendations.

There you go - no complicated server structure, "cloud", only static
files. Good stuff eh?

Now NYT picked up on the story - the broken nature of the Standard
Model is reaching a wider audience.

NYT: "[09/02] The Story of Our Universe May Be Starting to Unravel..
According to the standard model, which is the basis for essentially
all research in [cosmology], there is a fixed and precise sequence of
events that followed the [supposed] Big Bang.. The Webb data, though,
revealed that some very large galaxies formed really fast, in too
short a time, at least according to the standard model. This was no
minor discrepancy. The finding is akin to parents and their children
appearing in a story when the grandparents are still children
themselves...

Two serious issues with the standard model of cosmology would be
concerning enough. But the model has already been patched up numerous
times over the past half century to better conform with the best
available data — alterations that may well be necessary and correct,
but which, in light of the problems we are now confronting, could
strike a skeptic as a bit too convenient...

Physicists and astronomers are starting to get the sense that
something may be really wrong. It’s not just that some of us believe
we might have to rethink the standard model of cosmology; we might
also have to change the way we think about some of the most basic
features of our universe — a conceptual revolution that would have
implications far beyond the world of science"
