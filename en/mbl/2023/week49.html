<p>Yes but that presupposes a system of law that is abided, agreed upon
by all parties and the society in general. Where that exists, the
outliers can be subject to a certain procedure... For ISR/Palestine no
such backdrop, agreement exists. Israel does not follow UNSC

activity), or 2334. UNSC Res 478, 497..  UNSC does not recognize the

criminal responsibility for crimes against humanity, including the

<p>Matt Ferrell: "In the summer of 2023, the Rijnstate hospital of Elst,
The Netherlands opened its doors. What makes this particular campus
interesting is how it generates its energy... The building collects
energy from over 1,300 solar panels located on both the roof and the
ground floor. When there’s a surplus of solar, that energy goes toward
electrolysis, the splitting action that produces hydrogen. This then
allows for hydrogen fuel cells to kick in as a form of reserve power
when the sunnier supplies are low..</p>
<p><img width='340' src='https://undecidedmf.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image2.png'/> </p>
<p>The Rijnstate isn’t the only hospital that integrated hydrogen into
its energy generation this year. Just recently, the Viamed San José
Hospital located in Murcia, Spain, installed a system that involves
powering the creation of hydrogen through its 289 solar panels. The
resulting hydrogen feeds into a boiler for space heating. Meanwhile,
the oxygen produced as a byproduct of the electrolysis is then
repurposed as a critical resource for medical procedures</p>
<p>That’s insanely cool. Those hospitals are good examples of how green
hydrogen is already getting used today..</p>
<p>A while back, I covered a new form of electrolyzer by the Australian
company Hysata. Its design is really promising, with an efficiency
rating jumping from about 75% to a whopping 95%..</p>
<p>There’s also Sparc Hydrogen, a collaboration between Sparc
Technologies, the University of Adelaide, Flinders University, and
Fortescue Future Industries.14 Unlike typical setups, Sparc’s hydrogen
production method doesn’t require an electrolyzer or electricity
pulled from renewable energy infrastructure. Instead, it’s based on
photocatalytic water splitting, or PWS"</p>

<p>A rise in homelessness, same thing. If anything trickle-down economics
occurs only here - one percenter buys homes in excess snatching it
away from upper middle class, who do the same for middle class, down
and down it goes, and all of a sudden lower income person can't buy or
rent (rent price is a reflection of purchase price), ends up on
the streets. This is clear to see in the statistics, the modern
homeless isn't some random bum, half of these people are actually
employed!</p>
<hr />
<p>Ergo "housing crisis" is not about shortage in overall housing. The
crisis is a reflection of the society's inequality, there are enough
homes but the rich are buying them, as investment, end most end up
with no affordable housing. Middle class buys bread, wealthy buy
assets. If they have too much money, distribution is skewed, there
will be a bubble in the prices of those assets.</p>
<hr />
<p>Stevenson: "[2023/05] Most people in ordinary financial positions or poor
financial positions tend to spend all of their income over the course
of their life on goods and services. They generally die without any
accumulated assets, which means that they've spent everything on goods
and services. Ordinary people buy goods and services that drives
wages.  Rich people, on the other hand, especially very rich people,
tend to spend the majority of their income on buying more assets.</p>
<p>So that means if wealth inequality increases in society, ordinary and
poor people have less, rich and very rich people have more. Society as
a whole will start to want more assets and less goods and services.
And that is because we're moving purchasing power away from ordinary
people, who like goods and services, towards rich and very rich people
who like to buy assets.  So as inequality increases, asset prices
naturally go up.  Goods and services and wage prices naturally go
down.</p>
<p>But if you remember, our central banks are trying to ensure that goods
and services prices specifically keep going up at 2, 2.5, 3% a year.
Because we have rising inequality, those goods and services prices,
they want to go down because ordinary people who drive those prices
are losing their purchasing power. That means that for most of the
last 20, 30 years, central banks have been trying to convince ordinary
people to spend money by cutting their interest rates. But remember
those cutting interest rates, not only do they drive up ordinary
prices, they also drive up asset prices for the rich. But asset prices
for the rich are going up anyway, because the rich people are getting
more and more and more money.  So what's happening is this inequality
is driving down wages, driving down the price of goods and services,
and that forces action from central banks and governments, central
banks to cut interest rates, governments to spend more money to try
and support the economy. And a side effect of that is the rich get
even richer and asset prices go up even more.. so in a sense, what
you're seeing is another one of these.. death spirals of the economy"</p>

<p>Imagine giving an alien living in a completely different physical
environment all the text ever written by mankind, us. They decipher
the text, are able to read it. But would they, without seeing any of
the physical environment that gave rise to that text, understand what
it is to be human? They cannot. "I woke up saw the garden, walked in
the hills". If the aliens were non-solid, aethereal beings living in a
f-ing plasma mist, they could not get that reference. They'd put it
together, match it with other references of that kind, but they would
not truly know what it is meant on that text. Language is code. We
communicate <em>through</em> that code. Code signifies, is a shorthand for
something larger that is not present in that text, the
whole human experience.</p>

<p>Hossein-Zadeh: "[2006] Huntington’s theory of 'the clash of
civilizations' is essentially a subtle version of Richard Perle’s
strategy of 'de-contextualization.'  Perle, a leading neoconservative
militarist (and a prominent advisor of the Likud Party, the hard-line
Zionist party of Prime Minister Arial Sharon of Israel) coined the
term 'de-contextualization' as a way to explain both the desperate
acts of terrorism in general and the violent tactics of the
Palestinian resistance to occupation in particular. He argued that in
order to blunt the widespread global criticism of the Israeli
treatment of Palestinians, their resistance to occupation must be
decontextualized; that is, we must stop trying to understand the
territorial, geopolitical, and historical reasons that some groups
turn to terrorism. Instead, he suggested, the reasons for the violent
reactions of such groups must be sought in the arenas of culture
and/or religion—in the Islamic way of thinking. Like the 'clash of
civilizations' theory, decontextualization strategy has been part of a
well-orchestrated effort to divert attention from the root causes of
terrorism and attribute it to 'pathological problems of the Muslim
mind'"</p>

<hr />
<p>Stevenson's take on money: if I loan you 100 dollars, how much money
do you have? Some say 100, this is wrong.  Add assets and liabilities,
you end up with zero. You have 100 but you owe me 100, you have zero
dollars. All money is printed by Central Banks, and loaned to
individual banks.  It's their debt, central bank's credit. If we add
all debts and all credits in a system at any point in time it always
adds up to zero. This is how the modern money system is
constructed. It follows that if a certain section of the economy is
saddled with too much debt, another part of econ must have accumulated
too much money.</p>

<p>The graph below is somewhat different than GINI, but catches

<hr />
<p>Percentage of Wealth Held by Top 10%. Around 69%.. Bottom 50%
holds &lt;3% of the assets. Looks unequal.</p>
<p><a href="../../2021/01/stats.html#top10">[-]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Inequality leads the 1% buying more and more assets, their price
skyrockets. Eventually the rich end up buying assets the middle class
could use who are priced out of the market. They do that bcz this
is how they spend their money, lower income folk spend on goods and
services (shows up in CPI), the rich buy assets. GS solution, fix
inequality, tax the wealthy on their assets. Money does not represent
absolute level, it represents a distribution. Middle class can get
extra 1000 and be happy but if some get millions via subsidies, easy
credit, bailouts, comparatively speaking middle class is losing money.</p>
