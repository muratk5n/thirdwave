<p>Andersen: "The year that manifesto was published [1984] companies
bought back only a few billion dollars’ worth of their stock, but as
the decade ended five years later, the annual average was tens of
billions. That’s when Jack Welch (Jack Welch!) announced that GE (GE!)
was going to buy back the equivalent of $21 billion worth of its own
stock because that was so much easier than 'going out and taking a
wild swing' at developing new technologies or new businesses. It was
the biggest single buyback yet. Welch was acting even more like a Wall
Street guy, and Wall Street redoubled its love for him. Unquestionably

<p>Hansson: "[2022] Why we're leaving the cloud.. Now the argument
[against running your own servers] always goes: Sure, but you have to
manage these machines!  The cloud is so much simpler! The savings will
all be there in labor costs! Except no. Anyone who thinks running a
major service like [ours] in the cloud is 'simple' has clearly never
tried. Some things are simpler, others more complex, but on the whole,
I've yet to hear of organizations at our scale being able to
materially shrink their operations team, just because they moved to
the cloud.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful marketing coup, though. Sold with analogies like
'well you don't run your own powerplant either, do you?' or 'are
infrastructure services really your core competency?'. Then lathered
up with a thick coat of NEW-NEW-NEW paint, and The Cloud has beamed so
brightly only the luddites would consider running their own servers in
its shadow..</p>
<p>Meanwhile Amazon in particular is printing profits renting out servers
at obscene margins...  Of course it's expensive to rent your computers
from someone else. But it's never presented in those terms. The cloud
is sold as computing on demand, which sounds futuristic and cool, and
very much not like something as mundane as 'renting computers', even
though that's mostly what it is.</p>
<p>But this isn't just about cost. It's also about what kind of internet
we want to operate in the future. It strikes me as downright tragic
that this decentralized wonder of the world is now largely operating
on computers owned by a handful of mega corporations. If one of the
primary AWS regions go down, seemingly half the internet is offline
along with it. This is not what DARPA designed!"</p>

<p>It could be argued from two-state perspective Gaza was a problem for
Palestinians themselves.. Disconnected from the rest of Palestinians,
it is too strategic for Israelis to let be, maybe a Hamas+ plan
sacrificed their org (and a portion of their people sadly) for a state
in the West Bank. Their initial attack left such a deep mark that
invited a response from which there can't be any going back. Then Gaza
would make a stand, make a war to be remembered, so the oppo opinion
would have to shift to a big change, because both sides would have
bled enough for something different by then. Its sale to the rest of
decision makers, the public would be easier. That is one scenario.</p>
<hr />
<p>If ISR fights tooth and nail to "de-Hamasify" Gaza, likely won't want
to leave it once they have it. What will happen to Pals living there?
Will there be calls to relocate them to the West Bank? Then all Pals
will be in one place, is the next move the formation of Palestinian
state exclusively in West Bank? The ISR settlers there can be told to
go to Gaza, a sort of land swap, and two-state solution starts? One
scenario has it this is why someone kickstarted the whole thing
starting in Oct 7..</p>

reviewed by a human, but was reviewed by another bot, which (not
surprisingly) made a similar assessment"</p>

<p>Does the world look like it's being run by an empire? Empire is order,
Ottomans, Romans were feudal parasites, but at least they understood
the concept of 'unrest'. There is no order here.. It's like everyone
is acting within a few months of horizon, well, now that I think about
it likely is three months which is the window of a quarterly business
report... All is synched to a quarter.. Terrorist attack in Africa?
It's not "empire", it is a mining corp paying "Islamic terorists" to
scare locals off the land. They get mining rights, possess the land,
all is done so some jackass at a posh office abroad can meet his
quarterly goals. Columbian trade unionist should not be scared of
Jason Bourne coming after them, watch for a local thug or a mercenary
hired by Coca-Cola shooting your ass.</p>

<p>Politico: "The Israel-Hamas war cuts deep into Germany’s soul.. Amid a
spate of violent demonstrations and anti-Semitic incidents, Germany’s
post-Holocaust identity is on the line...</p>
<p>While similar scenes [protest] have played out across much of the
world [as in Berlin], for Germany’s leaders, they are profoundly
embarrassing and strike at the heart of the nation’s identity, on
account of the country’s Nazi past...</p>
<p>'Free Palestine from German guilt,' [leftist protestors] chanted in
English. Germany, the argument went, should get over its Holocaust
history, at least when it comes to support for Israel. The irony is
that there is much sympathy for this view on the far right"</p>

<p>You start hearing this slogan in protests now, especially in NYC - I
guess it is in opposition to "Never Again" of the previous generation.</p>

<p>HuffPost: "[Marans, 2021] Although the circumstances today are not
identical, Bush’s showdown with Israel in 1991 over the terms of
U.S. loan guarantees serves as an illustration of what a more
evenhanded U.S. approach to the conflict could look like. Bush
withheld the loan guarantees until he was satisfied that the money
borrowed with U.S. assistance would not go toward Israeli settlements
in the Palestinian territories. 'Bush established consequences for bad
behavior, and he got results,' said James Zogby, president of the Arab
American Institute"</p>
<hr />
<p>Politico: "A now-former U.S. official [Josh Paul] explains why he
resigned rather than pave the way for more arms transfers to Israel as
it battles Hamas...</p>
<p>'I know this is an unpopular opinion and too soon, but maybe the best
thing for Israel right now is not security assistance in the sort of
volume that makes them think they can afford to just ignore the
Palestinian question and hope that, cordoned off, it will go away. Or
to put it another way, if we weren’t giving them billions a year for
decades, is it more or less likely they would have found it in their
interest for the Oslo process to work and we wouldn’t be where we are
today...</p>
<p>[W]e always talk about Israel has a right to defend itself. And let’s
provide Israel with the Iron Dome, which by the way, I entirely
support. They should not have to live under rocket fire.</p>
<p>But we never turned it around and think about the threat to
Palestinians from Israeli incursions into their villages in the West
Bank on a constant basis, from bombardment from Israel against homes
in Gaza, or housing demolitions in the West Bank. We always approach
this problem from one perspective, and I think that’s part of the
problem.. we’ve seen for over 20 years that the commitment we made to
Israel of security for peace, essentially, has not led to security or
peace and in fact, leads to insecurity and makes peace further away...</p>
<p>[P]eople don’t grasp the day-to-day realities, and tend to only see
one side of the conflict, because that’s the side that’s easy to
access, that is media savvy, that is in many ways more relatable from
an American perspective'"</p>

<p>New Lines Magazine: "As the Middle East Reels, a New Option Takes
Shape: Expulsion.. The idea, which has gone through multiple
iterations over the decades since Israel’s founding, by turns illegal,
unworkable or extreme, posits the wholesale population transfer of
Gazans into the Sinai... Despite the long-standing prima facie
rejection by the Arab world of the idea of expulsion, this solution
is, apparently, increasingly seen as more feasible than asking Israel
to conduct its upcoming war on the strip with a judicious amount of
violence or to figure out a way to actually coexist with the
Palestinians. It has been floated by European and Israeli officials
without irony, which likely prompted Sisi’s response as well as
off-the-record comments by Egyptian and Arab officials to the media
pointing out the double standard of feigning concern for the human
rights of Palestinians while orchestrating a plan to deport them en
masse under pain of death..</p>
<p>During Israel’s creation in 1948, Zionist militia groups and the
Israeli army that grew out of them followed a blueprint called.. Plan
D [which] identified specific Palestinian cities and towns to be
targeted and provided instructions for how to expel their
inhabitants. An internal Israeli military intelligence document
reveals that at least 75% of the Palestinians who fled did so as a
result of 'military actions by Zionist militias, psychological
campaigns aimed at frightening Arabs into leaving, and dozens of
direct expulsions,' scholars Joel Beinin and Lisa Hajjar note.</p>
<p>Indeed, even shortly after 1948, a plan to resettle Palestinians in
the Sinai was tried... [I]n the early 1950s, the United Nations
hatched a plan to resettle tens of thousands of Palestinians in the
Sinai, thereby eliminating the Palestinian right of return. It
ultimately failed because, as Adler writes, 'The 1955 uprising in Gaza
— what would become known as the March Intifada — forced
U.N. officials to abandon refugee resettlement projects and recognize
Palestinian claims to a political identity of their own.'"</p>

<p>Zakaria: "Professor Dimitri Shumsky of Hebrew University writes [in
Haaretz.. ] provocatively that for years Netanyahu developed and
advanced a destructive, warped political doctrine that held that
strengthening Hamas at the expense of the Palestinian Authority would
be good for Israel. This approach divided the Palestinians, undermined
the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, and made it easy for
Netanyahu to claim there was no path to a Palestinian state.  Shumsky
cites a Jerusalem Post report that at a Likud Party meeting in 2019,
Netanyahu made clear that he supported the money that the Qatari
government was sending to Hamas. That way, Bibi is reported to have
said 'Israel would foil the establishment of a Palestinian state'. Tal
Schneider references the same meeting, and also notes that most of the
time Israel policy was to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden
and Hamas as an asset"</p>
