# Week 46


Politico: "The [US] administration’s dramatic about face all but
assured that the plan — which funds the government in two tranches
into January and February — would make it into law... That doesn’t
mean there weren’t hard compromises for Biden and allied Democrats to
swallow. The deal again leaves out the White House’s chief legislative
priority: a nearly $106 billion defense supplemental that would fund
aid to Ukraine, Israel and the Indo-Pacific"

RU FM says Palestinians even wanted to start talks wout preconditions
once bcz Putin asked but then Netan changed his mind. ISR never misses
an oppurtunity to cause Palestinians to miss an opportunity. Netan
must have received "the call" from "the complex" saying chaos makes us
more money, stop or else, he chickened out.

his sharpest criticism of Israel since war against Hamas broke out
over a month ago"

Carscoops: "Hydrogen, Not Electricity, Could Be The Future Of
Everything From Motorsport To Trucking.. Green vehicles mean
battery-powered vehicles, right? That’s the message we’re being fed on
a daily basis.. But having got off to a slow start in the green race,
hydrogen power is shifting into high gear, winning fans in industries
as varied as motorsport, trucking and plant machinery. And it might
even save our beloved combustion engines from extinction [via clean
fuels]"

Tried SBC + HDMI into mobile monitor, meh. Power req of monitors are
somewhat demanding. Their economics did not lead them into such improv
sadly, stock droid tablet can go on for a day wout problems acceptable
as dumb viewscreen.

Single Board Computer, fine. Wireless keyb into SBC with *nix, Android
tablet for remote desktop VNC (via local net). Worked well so
far.. Best of both worlds, full-blown Unix on board, fast viewing
through cheap tech. Durable, easy to carry for both. Power req is
minimal, tablet only a dumb viewscreen like those dumb terminals of
yesteryear. Tablet can also be used for occasional seperate net,
media consumption.

TPG Online Daily: "Caltrans signed an $80 million contract with
Stadler Rail, Inc. of Bussnang, Switzerland, to deliver zero-emission
hydrogen passenger trains. The contract includes a base order of 80
million for the first four trainsets between Merced and Sacramento
with options for up to 25 additional trainsets that can be used
throughout California"

Graeber, *Debt*: "Almost all the bubbles of the eighteenth century
involved some fantastic scheme to use the proceeds of colonial
ventures to pay for European wars. Paper money was debt money, and
debt money was war money, and this has always remained the case. Those
who financed Europe's endless military conflicts also employed the
government's police and prisons to extract ever-increasing
productivity from the rest of the population" via @categulario@bookwyrm.welhaba.mx

NYT: "More Than 400 U.S. Officials Sign Letter Protesting Biden’s
Israel Policy The signers, representing some 40 government agencies,
reflect growing internal dissent over the administration’s support of
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza"

---

Politico: "State Department staffers offered a blistering critique of
the Biden administration’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war in a
dissent memo obtained by POLITICO, arguing that, among other things,
the U.S. should be willing to publicly criticize the Israelis... It
reflects the sentiments of many U.S. diplomats, especially at
mid-level and lower ranks, according to conversations with several
department staffers as well as other reports.. The memo has two key
requests: that the U.S. support a ceasefire, and that it balance its
private and public messaging toward Israel, including airing
criticisms of Israeli military tactics and treatment of Palestinians
that the U.S. generally prefers to keep private"

The crowd was bussed in by AIPAC. When reporters talk to individuals
they repeat the same talking point over and over again. So not only
bussed, someone gave them a script.

SF Writer Charlie Stross: "[T]he influence of science fiction on our
environment seems to have been gathering pace throughout my entire
life. The future is a marketing tool... It's becoming increasingly
unusual to read a report of a new technology or scientific discovery
that doesn't breathlessly use the phrase 'it seems like science
fiction'. The news cycle is currently dominated by hype about
artificial intelligence (a gross mis-characterisation of machine
learning algorithms and large language models). A couple of years ago
it was breathless hype about cryptocurrency and blockchain
technologies—which turned out to be a financial services bubble that
drained a lot of small investors' savings accounts into the pockets of
people like convicted fraudster Sam Bankman-Fried"

The Pal prime minister from the PA is talking a bunch on F24. Poor guy
sounds distressed, understandably so. I realized how little we heard
of them in recent years - ISR plan to cut them out of the discourse
clearly worked. It was all about Hamas Hamas Hamas, ISR spox talking
shit about them, that took all oxygen out of the room and now here we
are.

Ian Miell: "I have just returned to front end development after 20-odd
years.

Oh. My. God.

now it's considered a bug"

Why does Israel rely so much on bombing? Bombs are a money maker for
the [military-industrial-likud](../../2023/11/political-econ-us-mil.html)
complex. A soldier on foot shooting a rifle is chump change. That
won't move the stock value at all. You need to rely on big ticket
items, like a BOMB. They will move the dial.

Revisionist Zionists have a real hard-on for that al-Aqsa Mosque don't
they..? They want to destroy it, bomb it, and rebuild their temple in
its place.

There is an improved version of the Ukraine map shared earlier
allowing comparison between any two dates. Members and long-time
readers can find that on my primary site.

There is the occasional support for Israel in the odd developing
country, but that likely has to do with weapon purchases than anything
else. The US laws that prohibits sale of certain weapons to certain
countries can be by-passed by selling those weapons to Israel who
promptly resells them to the prohibited country.

I worked at an customer analytics project, pre-911, our team bought
personal data from Experian. The info was at some incredible
detail. >300 million US/Canada citizens. We received it, and put it on
an external hard drive, it sat there on our desk, getting connected to
occasionally, it is still hilarious to think bunch of programmers at a
private firm took that from another private firm, with no checks or
balances whatsoever. Now such data hoarding is a cottage industry.

"@dangillmor@mastodon.social

Experian is a criminally negligient 'credit bureau' that hoovers up
personal information, sells it, and lets identity thieves easily steal
'your' account. There is absolutely no accountability because Congress
doesn't give a damn -- and Experian blatantly doesn't give a damn"

Arab News: "British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak brought back former
leader David Cameron as foreign minister on Monday..  The return of
Cameron suggested Sunak wanted to bring in more centrist, experienced
hands rather than appease the right of his party which supported

The Independent: "[11/11] Met Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley

Business Insider: "In October, Cruise lost its permit in California
entirely after an incident in which a pedestrian was dragged beneath
one of its driverless vehicles 20 feet after it ran her over after she
was first struck by a different car. GM, Cruise's parent company, then
paused all Cruise robotaxi operations nationwide"

Ukraine/Russia frontline comparison as a browsable map, comparison
between 10/24 (blue) and 11/11 (red). RU advances around Avdiivka are
clear to see. Another avoidable war but being executed thanks to the
West and their arms lobby.

Hossein-Zadeh: "Frightened by the specter of peace and/or peace
dividends [after the fall of the Berlin Wall], beneficiaries of
military spending frantically sought to invent and substitute 'new
threats' for the 'communist threat' of the Cold War era, thereby
preempting the realization of peace dividends.

In pursuit of this goal, beneficiaries of war and militarism found a
strong, well-established network of politically savvy allies: radical
Zionist proponents of 'greater Israel.' Because the interests of these
two powerful groups converged over fomenting war and political
convulsion in the Middle East, an ominously potent alliance was forged
between them— ominous, because the mighty U.S. war machine was now
supplemented by the almost unrivaled public relations capabilities of
the hard-line pro-Israel lobby in the United States. The alliance is
unofficial and de facto; it is subtly forged through an elaborate
network of powerful militaristic think tanks"
