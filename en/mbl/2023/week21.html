<p>Nyserda: "Governor Kathy Hochul today announced a $10 million
initiative to advance innovative clean hydrogen research, development

<hr />
<p>There are bizarre ideas on population growth and its place in
economics..  Some keep arguing more people are needed for growth, but
that is mainly a right-wing argument, they just want cheap labor, more
people competing for jobs is good for them as they root for the
bosses, "the supply side". See below, povery <em>caused</em> population
growth. Population growth in the industrial age did not fuel the
industrial age, it was the result of it. Econ growth does not need
numbers, it needs know-how. You don't need more workers to pay for
retirees. Current accounting could indicate that, but the efficacy of
that accounting is in question.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>The Limits to Growth, the 30 Year Update</em>: In poor
countries.. [b]ecause immediate requirements leaves little output for
industrial investment, the economy grows only slowly. The demographic
transition stays stuck in the middle phase, with a large gap between
birth and death rates. When women see no attractive educational or
economic alternatives to childbearing, children are one of the few
forms of investment available; thus the population grows bigger
without growing richer.  As the saying goes, 'The rich get richer and
the poor get children.'</p>
<p>International gatherings can become paralyzed by passionate
arguments.. Poverty causes population growth, or population growth
causes poverty.. By drawing output away from investment and into
consumption, population growth slows capital growth. Poverty, in turn,
perpetuates population growth by keeping people in conditions where
they have no education, no health care, no family planning, no
choices, no power, no way to get ahead except to hope their children
can bring in income or help with family labor...</p>
<p>Food production in every part of the South has increased greatly over
the past 20 years. In most places it has doubled or tripled. But
because of rapid population growth, food production per person has
barely improved, and in Africa it has steadily decreased. The only
places where food production has noticeably kept ahead of population
growth are Europe and the Far East.  The graphs.. show a double
tragedy. The first is a human one. A great agricultural achievement, a
tremendous increase in food production, has been largely absorbed not
in feeding people more adequately but in feeding more people
inadequately. The second tragedy is environmental. The increase in
food production has been attained by policies that damaged soils,
waters, forests, and ecosystems, a cost that will make future
production increases more difficult.</p>
<p>But any positive feedback loop that grinds a system down can be turned
around to lift the system up. More poverty means more population,
which means more poverty. But less poverty means slower population
growth, which means less poverty. With enough investment sustained for
a long enough time, with fair pricing for products and labor, with
increasing output allocated much more directly to the poor, and
especially to the education and employment of women and to family
planning, the effects of the population–poverty loop can be
reversed"</p>

<p>Later in the article he says 'there could be more lithium'. Wishful
thinking... The estimates give a number for discovered + yet
undiscovered reserves an estimate on the total. If that number falls
short (and it does), the tech's future is in trouble.</p>
<hr />
<p>He understates the problem, the reserves are enough for only a quarter
of transportation needs. But at least NS acknowledged the issue, not
many BEVtards do.</p>

close to the total that we might need to electrify transportation, and
of course there will be competing demands for lithium from power

<p>If neoliberalism did not turn out to be the shitshow it is today and

<p>Lowe: "Why AlphaFold [NN in biology] won’t revolutionise drug
discovery.. DeepMind’s AlphaFold team has been having quite a run of
success in predicting protein structures. This has long been
considered one of the truly difficult problems in computational
biology..</p>
<p>[But] some of the headlines have betrayed real misunderstandings about
what’s been accomplished. First off, as I wrote here earlier this
year, we have not made sudden huge leaps in understanding why proteins
fold like they do. The AlphaFold people have made great progress in
recognising different known protein folding motifs and assembling them
into structures that are very often correct. Forming these coils,
loops, and sheets is what proteins generally do, but ‘why?’ doesn’t
enter into it...</p>
<p>It also needs to be emphasised that (as carefully worded above) what
we have are predictions and not real protein structures. They’re good
predictions and useful ones, but obtaining actual data (from x-ray,
NMR, or cryo-electron microscopy) is the only way to be sure how
correct they are.. That’s why press coverage about how this new
prediction database will revolutionise drug discovery are overblown"</p>

<p>Lerner: "To everyone who sees them, the new James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) images of the cosmos are beautifully awe-inspiring. But to most
professional astronomers and cosmologists, they are also extremely
surprising—not at all what was predicted by theory. In the flood of
technical astronomical papers published online since July 12, the
authors report again and again that the images show surprisingly many
galaxies, galaxies that are surprisingly smooth, surprisingly small
and surprisingly old.  Lots of surprises, and not necessarily pleasant
ones. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09428">One paper</a>’s title begins
with the candid exclamation: “Panic!”</p>
<p>Why do the JWST’s images inspire panic among cosmologists? And what
theory’s predictions are they contradicting? The papers don’t actually
say. The truth that these papers don’t report is that the hypothesis
that the JWST’s images are blatantly and repeatedly contradicting is
the Big Bang Hypothesis"</p>

<em>The Sunday Times</em>, along with other newspapers in Rupert Murdoch's
News International group, after production was shifted to a new plant
in Wapping in January 1986... All of the workers were dismissed. The
failure of the strike was devastating for the print union workers, and
it led both to a general decline in trade union influence in the
UK... Along with the miners' strike of 1984–85, the Wapping dispute
was a significant defeat in the history of the British trade union

that poverty is pervasive in America by design, to enable the

countries.. [His] greatest contribution is changing the lens from
individual behavior — the hoary focus of so many books about poverty —
to asking and answering the larger question, 'Who benefits from
practices that keep people poor?' Poverty, he argues, results from
three quintessentially American habits: exploitation of the poor;
subsidization of the rich; and the intentional segregation of the
affluent and the poor such that opportunity is hoarded and social
mobility is rare"</p>

design improvements in a certain tree search approach (human coded,
not deepfaked by an parrot moron algo), but the rest is... simple
compression. Sample games are compressed into a neural net, for
subsequent games computer can make similar moves "inspired" by that
