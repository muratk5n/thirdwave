<p>The same directors did try later to make up for their mistake though,
partly in another movie - <em>Jupiter Rising</em>. The heroine was working
class (a cleaner girl who was 'special') and the bad people are an
intergalactic empire who 'own' Earth. Their dominance have Matrix-y
aspects, they can erase people's memories to make sure they are not
known but the control is not like Matrix level which symbolizes
government that every libertard should tremble in fear about whenever
they hear its name. The overlords of JR are of a feudal type and
mostly interested in humans as products, they want to harvest them and
become rich. So in essence they are capitalists, cornering their
markets, producing their products and above all, exploiting. </p>
<hr />
<p>After the first, the Wachowskis realized what they had done. They had
created a magnum opus, a <em>magnifique travail</em> for every anti-gov ultra
libertard fuckjob out there and they wanted to reel in some of their
"message".</p>
<p>II and III shows some easing of the boundaries between the humans and
"AI".  Smith gets something of Neo in him, who will later help the
machines survive.  The concept of The One is taken down a notch,
there've been others before. This way the "us against them" situation
if muddled, weakened, placed in the backburner if you will. If the
theme music of the first was Rob Zombie's <em>Dragula</em> the theme music
for the next two would be <em>Why Cant We Be Friends?</em> Corporatists after
all want gov off their case, beaten down, be their bitch, but they
dont want it completely gone. They want an entity to subsidize them,
socialize their losses, and act like a capitalist enabler when they
are making huge profits. All this libertard stuff is supposed to stay
at cosplay level, go buy some guns play the weekend warrior, act the
independent maverick type in your own little delusional sphere but
stay in the corporate ladder, and respect the markets. You are not
supposed to rock the boat, because these f--kers live on that
boat. They <em>are</em> the boat, this is the world in which they've already
won. There is no need to change that. </p>
