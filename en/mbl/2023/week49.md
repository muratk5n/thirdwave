Beyond the illegality issue the main problem is the fundamental
weaknesses of this tech. It cannot be scaled up, must be handled with
kid gloves (read: high TCO) and even at its best comes with massive
range issues when deployed on cars.

ABC Australia: "There are growing calls for batteries to be declared
dangerous goods as illegally dumped lithium ion batteries are causing
nearly 40 fires a day at recycling facilities and landfills"

Stevenson's take on money: if I loan you 100 dollars, how much money
do you have? Some say 100, this is wrong.  Add assets and liabilities,
you end up with zero. You have 100 but you owe me 100, you have zero
dollars. All money is printed by Central Banks, and loaned to
individual banks.  It's their debt, central bank's credit. If we add
all debts and all credits in a system at any point in time it always
adds up to zero. This is how the modern money system is
constructed. It follows that if a certain section of the economy is
saddled with too much debt, another part of econ must have accumulated
too much money.

The graph below is somewhat different than GINI, but catches
interesting patterns. It suggests ineq has been getting worse since
90s (and likely 80s, no data there) save for a few brief downticks
it kept increasing and the bad state has recently solidified.

Percentage of Wealth Held by Top 10%. Around 69%.. Bottom 50%
holds <3% of the assets. Looks unequal.

[[-]](../../2021/01/stats.html#top10)

Inequality leads the 1% buying more and more assets, their price
skyrockets. Eventually the rich end up buying assets the middle class
could use who are priced out of the market. They do that bcz this
is how they spend their money, lower income folk spend on goods and
services (shows up in CPI), the rich buy assets. GS solution, fix
inequality, tax the wealthy on their assets. Money does not represent
absolute level, it represents a distribution. Middle class can get
extra 1000 and be happy but if some get millions via subsidies, easy
credit, bailouts, comparatively speaking middle class is losing money.

Good points by former Citibank trader Gary Stevenson on the problems

Conflicts with the Army Chief Zalushny, the previous President, now this..
Current gov's critics are increasing in number.

Yahoo News: "Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko has told Der Spiegel that
Ukraine is moving towards authoritarianism, seemingly making a veiled
criticism of President Volodymyr Zelensky"

Venezuella referandum on annexing neighboring Guyana.. [Here's](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-raises-guyana-resource-estimate-after-new-discovery-2021-10-07)
an earlier share about Guyana's oil major find. Exxon is there, and
the consortium also includes China. Even Cuba seems to be against any
annexation.

NYT: "Vice President Kamala Harris said on Saturday that the United
States fiercely opposes forcibly relocating Gaza residents outside the
enclave..

She also rejected an idea suggested recently by some Israeli officials
that the borders of Gaza could shrink after the war is over to
accommodate a security 'buffer zone' between the interior of Gaza and
Israel. The statement said the United States would not permit 'the
redrawing of the borders of Gaza.'..

'Palestinians need a hopeful political horizon, economic opportunity
and freedom. And the region more broadly must be integrated and
prosperous. And we must work toward that'"

Politico: "Pentagon: US arms industry struggling to keep up with China"

---

The dubious 'Hamas beheading' news during Oct 7 attack apparently
started in French BFM TV who took the news from Israeli i24news
channel. And what a coincidence, both channels are owned by the
Israeli businessman Patrick Drahi.

Euractiv: "The EU's Hydrogen Bank has begun operations.. By 2030,
Europe wants to produce 10 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen
annually. To get companies to switch, Brussels is footing the
difference between their ability to pay and the high prices charged by
producers of clean-burning gas"

---

"@EU_Commission@respublicae.eu

Hydrogen is going to be a key technology to decarbonise Europe's
industry and help meet our climate targets.  Today, we've launched the
first auction under the European Hydrogen Bank to support the
production of renewable hydrogen in Europe"

Thacker Pass, Nevada, is a place where a massive lithium mine is
taking place. It runs over the human rights of Native American tribes
in the area, displaced decades ago by genocide and forced retreat to
reservations on land thought to be of no value. Now these people,
among the poorest in the US, are being abused again. In addition to
mining's traditional destruction, one ton of lithium requires 500,000
gallons of water to harvest"

"Cambridge researchers' device can turn contaminated water or seawater
into clean hydrogen and purified water, anywhere in the world.. [The
researchers] deposited a photocatalyst on a nanostructured carbon mesh
that is a good absorber of both light and heat, generating the water
vapour used by the photocatalyst to create hydrogen. The porous carbon
mesh, treated to repel water, served both to help the photocatalyst
float and to keep it away from the water below, so that contaminants
do not interfere with its functionality.

In addition, the new device uses more of the Sun's energy. 'The
light-driven process for making solar fuels only uses a small portion
of the solar spectrum - there's a whole lot of the spectrum that goes
unused,' said [one researcher]"

Ethiopia is landlocked which is a big problem for them. If there
was proactive conflict resolution there would be mechanisms to
ensure ETH sea access. 

BBC: "Ethiopia is abuzz with rumours of a new war .. As well as
importing weapons and mobilising his army, [PM] Mr Abiy.. has been
saying that access to the sea is an existential question... Ethiopia's
most obvious target is the Eritrean Red Sea port of Assab, which was
part of Ethiopia until Eritrean independence more than 30 years ago"

Another movie of his *The Dictator* belittles Middle Eastern
countries, supports the view that ppl living in such places along with
their dictators are backward losers. This will lead to the thought
well bomb the shit out of them why not, with, you know, our very
latest awesome new Motherbomber 2040+. The last part the viewer had to
infer himself obvously but hey, leave some stuff to the
imagination. Such is art.

Sacha BC is a shitlib, it makes sense. Shitlibs are Woke, pro-Zionist,
and anti-Russian, which helps the private industrial complex (more
animosity more bombs more money). Woke shifts the discussion from the
economy, gaslights away from extreme inequality, Russia Russia Russia,
Hamas Hamas Hamas helps with weapon sales... This ideology is
manufactured from ground up for the interests of the war lobby.

He plays a person from "Kazakhistan" but the type is generally from
Caucuses, Eurasian looking.. Shown as brash, crass, little stupid -
not much different from how Russians were portrayed in US movies for
decades.

Borat movies are anti-Russian propaganda

Did not watch the debate hosted by Cardigan Shananigan for Newsom-RDS,
no.  I'm sure it was interesting.. I read some excerpts tho - "we have
one thing in common.. neither of us will be the nominee for our party
in 2024”.

TDB: "[F]ive weeks after Mike Johnson was elected speaker, and nearly
eight weeks since the attack, Congress doesn’t appear any closer to
passing an aid package—for Israel or for Ukraine, the latter of which
has been 'weeks' away from running out of weapons for months now"

---

Al Jazeera J Bays made a good point, Lula / Brasil put
forward a UNSC resolution weeks ago to halt Gaza violence, US vetoed
it. Then 29 days later they allowed a similar resolution by
abstaining. In those 29 days there were thousands of additional
deaths.
