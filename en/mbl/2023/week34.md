Did you know that 5.8 million tonnes of textiles are thrown away every
year, nearly 11 kilos per person? We endorse the European Commission‚Äôs
proposal to make producers responsible for the full lifecycle of
textile products and to support the sustainable management of textile
waste across the EU"

404 Media: "Most Americans have very little choice but to provide
their personal information to credit bureaus. Hackers have found a way
into that data supply chain, and are advertising access in group chats
used by violent criminals who rob, assault, and shoot
targets... Senator Ron Wyden [said] 'These companies have demonstrated
that they can't control who has access to their data products. The
government needs to stop these companies from packaging and selling
our personal information, and the senior executives that put profit
over national security and Americans' safety should be punished
accordingly'"

NASA: "In a paper published.. by the *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*,
[researchers] described how they used a climate model to estimate
the impact of 13 sectors of the economy from 2000 to 2100. They
based their calculations on real-world inventories of emissions collected
by scientists around the world, and they assumed that those emissions
would stay relatively constant in the future.

In their analysis, motor vehicles emerged as the greatest contributor
to atmospheric warming now and in the near term. Cars, buses, and
trucks release pollutants and greenhouse gases that promote warming,
while emitting few aerosols that counteract it"

But JFK's suave image was useful for post 80s shitlibs as they could
hide behind it and push for the right-leaning econ policies helpful
for the rich (like JFK), at the same time you could blame the
government (per [grand bargain](../../2023/06/evil-geniuses.html#bargain))
for his death giving you two birds with one stone. Speechify some shit
about space and cut benefits for the poor. That has been the Democrat
game for decades.

---

Bay of Pigs was a leftover plan from the Eisenhower admin to
JFK. Kennedy modified the plan, and like a true Kennedy f--ked it all
up, made it worse, mismanaged the mission and its aftermath (not to
mention the mistake of pursuing it in the first place). Then he gets
into blood feud with Castro and the stupid son of a bitch gets himself
shot.. The worst US president of modern times.

---

Ike.. He helped big biz then on his way out complained about the
"military-industrial complex" which in a way he ran and helped
flourish.

Plokhy, *Nuclear Folly*: "In May 1959 Castro limited the size of
agricultural estates to one thousand acres; the rest were to be
confiscated and redistributed by the government. In July 1960 the
government nationalized all US-owned businesses and properties: since
the revolutionary government needed resources and lacked money, no
compensation was offered... In response President Eisenhower closed
American markets to Cuban sugar, by far the island‚Äôs main export. The
United States found itself in a situation akin to the one that the old
imperial powers, Britain and France, had faced in their Asian and
African colonies and dependencies...

American interests were at stake..Luckily, the president‚Äôs advisers
had a plan to deal with the crisis. Only a few years earlier, in June
1954, the CIA had executed a successful coup in Guatemala, where land
reform threatened the interests of the United Fruit Company. In March
1960, with agrarian reform in Cuba already underway.. Eisenhower
decided to bring about regime change in Cuba"

The Guardian: "Bernardo Ar√©valo was elected president of
Guatemala.. Until a few months ago, the idea of an Ar√©valo presidency
seemed far-fetched. The 64-year-old intellectual, who was born in
Uruguay after his father was forced into exile by 1954‚Äôs CIA-backed
coup"

For most of its existence USG branches existed to serve the needs of

pattern.

Zinn Education Project: "On June 27, 1954, democratically elected

Note the mention of H2

Reuters: "Explainer: Why are countries racing to the moon's heavily
cratered south pole? Scientists are interested in pockets of ancient
ice because they could provide a record of lunar volcanoes. If ice
exists in sufficient quantities, it could be a source of drinking
water for moon exploration and could help cool equipment. It could
also be broken down to produce hydrogen for fuel and oxygen to
breathe, supporting missions to Mars or lunar mining"

Exactly 14 years ago , Satoshi Nakamoto designed the most pathetic /
inefficient system ever invented by humankind : the blockchain.

Today, it weights 60 000 tons, wastes constantly 10 gigawatts (more
than Belgium or Chile) to process less than 7 transactions per second:
Less than a 33 bps modem from 1990.

This could be a joke if it didn't have such gigantic environmental
impact, wasn't enabling billion dollars ransomware industry and was
not crushing thousands of lives in the process"

Instead of pumping sea water into the canal as needed, they used water
collecting somewhere high-up so its movement would be easier I bet.
Suez works on sea water. PC design sounds like a US capitalist design
- exploiting nature, trying to get something for nothing but screwing
up something else in the process, with a fragile design to boot. When
things get funky invade the host country once in a while too, won't
hurt.

The Guardian: "[The Panama Canal] was also one of the greatest
engineering feats in the world, in which the Americans built the canal
over the hills of Panama in a series of great locks, a system that
relies entirely on rain... Around 52 million gallons of fresh water is
lost to the sea each time a ship enters or leaves the canal. That
water is replaced from a vast reservoir built high in the hills, which
in turn is replenished by heavy rainfall ‚Äì but if the rains dry up so
does the canal"

---

Relies on rain water..?

Yahoo News: "200 Ships Are Stuck at the Panama Canal.. The
50-mile-long canal, as the report notes, relies on rainwater to
replenish it. When it doesn't rain enough, the authorities that
control the canal have to reduce traffic through it to conserve water,
and those that are allowed through have to pay higher fees to do so"

agricultural reasons, including clearing the land for new crops"

Math is useful so natural science formulations can proceed without
problems - when mathematics is used to model physical phenomena,
various branches of math allows you to enter realms to simplify stuff;
Ended up with a square root of -1? No problem!  Call it `i`, here is
the book-keeping around that (imaginery numbers), off you go, keep on
deriving, continue... From infinities, into the imaginery, to groups,
to manifolds.. some stuff cancels out, simplifies then back to real
world with a clean formula.
