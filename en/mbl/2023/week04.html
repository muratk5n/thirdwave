<p>"I wondered, who else out there had envisioned a smartphone back in
the day [with n]o store, no cloud, no company tracking everything you
do and every call you make? In early 2014, Blackberry was
faltering. Microsoft phones didn't solve that problem. I thought back
to the phones I had once known and loved, and settled on Nokia. And it
turned out they did! They did build a smartphone!</p>
<p>The Nokia N9 was absolutely gorgeous (still is), completely enchanting
and amazing, and fully functional. It won design awards right and
left. It ran using Linux, so people who wanted to give it commands
like a little computer could go right ahead. A far cry from the walled
garden of Apple, or the user interfaces that controlled what you could
and could not do on your own phone.</p>
<p>But it was late to market. Nokia sold to Microsoft, Microsoft canned
the project, and that might have been the end of the story...</p>
<p><img width="340" src="https://www.optoutproject.net/media/posts/5/responsive/N9-copy-md.jpg"/></p>
<p>... except that the people who designed this beauty's operating system
took the IP, started a new Finnish company called Jolla, and kept
working on it to build a new generation of phones with the same
concept, now called the Sailfish operating system. Data ownership,
autonomy, no walled gardens, gesture-based interfaces, the works.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the people who used the phone loved it so much that they
wrote entire libraries of code to keep it working. In other words,
they built their own app store. They rescripted the phone so it could
talk to upgraded network towers.  And when Sailfish came out, many of
them started using Sailfish too, helping the community to grow and the
company to iron out the bugs"</p>

<p>In the previous Iraq map the weird borders on the upper right are not
