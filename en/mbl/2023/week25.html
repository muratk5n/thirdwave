<p>The Epoch Times: [2022/09] Incidents of electric vehicles (EVs)
catching fire after being submerged in saltwater are not uncommon, a
federal traffic safety authority said. 'We are tracking Florida EV
fires through news reports, fire department social media sites, and
other sources, and we can confirm your experience in North Collier
with reignition is not an isolated event,' the [NHTSA] wrote in a
letter to Jimmy Patronis, the chief financial officer of Florida
Department of Financial Services. NHTSA made the statement in response
to a letter from Patronis. Patronis mentioned in his letter to the
traffic safety agency an incident in North Collier, Florida, where an
EV ignited and kept re-igniting after Hurricane Ian. 'I joined North
Collier Fire Rescue to assess response activities related to Hurricane
Ian and saw with my own eyes an EV continuously ignite, and
continually reignite, as fireteams doused the vehicle with
tens-of-thousands of gallons of water,' he wrote. 'I was informed by
the fire department that the vehicle, once again reignited when it was
loaded onto the tow truck.'  'I am very concerned that we may have a
ticking time bomb on our hands,' he added. NHTSA said it first
observed EV fires after a hurricane in October 2012 in Newark, New
Jersey. The fires—which are caused by the lithium-ion battery—can
happen right after the vehicle was submerged in saltwater or 'several
weeks' after being submerged"</p>

biocatalyst is extremely robust and tolerant to compounds that are

<p>What really scared these freedom defenders during covid was that you

matters insofar you buy the product, they would freely pollute a river

too the moment things get rough. Whiners. Wankers. </p>

<p>The "freedom scare" around the issue of covid - another
smokescreen. Ultra free market nuts use it to shift focus from the

<p>U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a passenger in the hydrogen cell-powered car, was

<p>The U.S. lags behind other countries, most notably South Korea,
because of a lack of hydrogen fueling stations, the study says, though
it has been picking up in places such as California. Another study, by
Market Research Future, expects the U.S. hydrogen fuel cell market to
increase by more then 68% to $46.8 billion by 2030. Casey said tax

<p>Smith, <em>The Permanent Coup</em>: "In 2010 Yanukovych was again elected
president.. [T]he Ukrainian leader [was advised] to sign the
association agreement offered by the European Union. It was little
more than a trade deal that dumped European, especially German, goods
into the Ukrainian and, more important, Russian, markets. There were
hints the agreement was a first step toward EU accession, but that was
fanciful.  Ukraine is the poorest country in Europe, and Berlin was
not looking to float another economic basket case after bailing out
Greece.</p>
<p>Putin saw the association agreement as a threat to Russia’s economic
stability and therefore his power. Late in 2013 he gave Yanukovych a
choice between crippling economic measures and a $15 billion aid
package. When Yanukovych withdrew from the EU deal, the streets filled
with [.. protestors] demonstrating for EU membership that would allow
them to flee their beloved homeland in search of a future
elsewhere. On November 21, 2013, the arrival of protestors at Kiev’s
Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) marked the birth of the
Maidan Revolution, or Euromaidan"</p>

Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts progressive, have collaborated on
a bill to claw back executive pay at failed banks.. Senator Marco
Rubio of Florida has signed a public letter calling for the
reinvigoration of collective bargaining and praising the German
approach, in which labor unions play a larger role in the
economy. Rubio this month published a book, “Decades of Decadence,”
that criticizes the past 30 years of globalization.Senator Todd Young
of Indiana has helped write a bipartisan bill to restrict noncompete
agreements, which companies use to prevent their employees from
leaving for jobs at a competitor.Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas was

<p>Odd coincidence; that "20 times less" issue keeps <a href="../../2022/11/battery-electric.html#reserves">showing up</a>
when the subject is lithium.</p>
<hr />
<p>Eric Lerner: "[Answering the question 'can you save the Big Bang
Theory by tweaking it' outlines the problems with the approach an
listing gross mistakes of the BBT. First is] too little helium..  a
very basic prediction of The BBT which is that there should be a
certain amount of helium produced by Fusion reactions during the Big
Bang and there should be more helium and older in stars that have
processed hydrogen.. but observations have shown that in nearby stars
and even in planetary nebula.. where we can observe helium directly
the amount of helium is only half what's predicted by the [BBT]..</p>
<p>What's worrying.. Big Bang cosmologists is that the very basic
assumption of [the theory] is that the universe is homogeneous and
isotropic modulus.. Isotropic means the same in every direction.
Without those basic assumptions there would be no expanding universe
there would be no BB. General relativity only predicts an expanding or
contracting universe if the universe is homogeneous and isotropic
which has never been observed and today with even better observations
there are more and more anisotropies. When we look in different
directions in the sky we get different measurements, for example of
the Hubble constant, the constant that describes the relationship
between redshift and distance, we get different densities of radio
galaxies of X-ray galaxies of quasars. All of these are different in
different directions [leading to] lopsided star maps and therefore
again contradict the basic hypotheses of the BB...</p>
<p>[Another problem is] too little lithium; this again is the well-known
lithium problem, the BB makes predictions about three light elements,
helium, lithium and deuterium which is the heavy isotope of ordinary
hydrogen. The lithium it gets wrong entirely.. observations of lithium
are 20 times less than the predictions of the BB - a gross
contradiction...</p>
<p>If an airline advertises that out of the last 17 flights 16 crashed
and one got through would you fly on that airline? I think the answer
is obvious, and the answer to the question [of tweaking BB to save it]
is also obvious, with 16 wrong answers and one right answer this isn't
a theory that needs to be tweaked, this is a theory that needs to be
thrown away"</p>
