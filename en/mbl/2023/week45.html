by territorial maximalism. Revisionist Zionism promoted expansionism
and the establishment of a Jewish majority on both sides of the Jordan
River. Developed by Ze'ev Jabotinsky.. [it] insisted upon the Jewish
right to sovereignty over the whole of Eretz Yisrael, which they
equated to Mandatory Palestine and Transjordan..</p>

<p>Ars Technica: "[W]hen evidence emerged in the early 1970s about the
health effects of indoor nitrogen dioxide exposure from gas stove use,
the American Gas Association launched a campaign designed to
manufacture doubt about the existing science. As a researcher who
has¬†studied air pollution for many years‚Äîincluding gas stoves‚Äô
contribution to indoor air pollution and health effects‚ÄîI am not na√Øve
about the strategies that some industries use to¬†avoid or delay
regulations. But I was surprised to learn that the multipronged
strategy related to gas stoves directly mirrored tactics that the
tobacco industry used to¬†undermine and distort scientific evidence¬†of
health risks associated with smoking starting in the 1950s"</p>

<p>The Guardian: "When a microbe was found munching on a plastic bottle
in a rubbish dump, it promised a recycling revolution. Now scientists
are attempting to turbocharge those powers in a bid to solve our waste
crisis.. [I]n 2001, a group of Japanese scientists [from Kyoto
Institute of Technology and the Keio University] made a startling
discovery at a rubbish dump. In trenches packed with dirt and waste,
they found a slimy film of bacteria that had been happily chewing
through plastic bottles, toys and other bric-a-brac... [S]ince 2021, a
French company named Carbios has been running an operation that uses a
bacterial enzyme to process about 250kg of PET plastic waste every
day, breaking it down into its precursor molecules"</p>

Renewable Energy (MNRE) envisages the production of 10 million tons of
green hydrogen by 2030 with half of that being used as a substitute
for fossil fuels in transport and in the hard to abate industrial
sectors.  The other 5 million tons would be earmarked for
export... [N]umerous private firms such as Reliance, Adani, ReNew
Power and L&amp;T [are] lining up for a piece of the action. Reliance
wants to produce green hydrogen for $USD1 a kg by 2030. Ten states led
by Gujarat, but including Karnataka, Maharashtra and Kerala, have also
