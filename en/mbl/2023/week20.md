Hersh: "[A]s some in the American intelligence community know and have
reported in secret, at the instigation of government officials at
various levels in Poland, Hungary, Lithuania, Estonia, the Czech
Republic, and Latvia.. all allies of Ukraine and declared enemies of
Vladimir Putin.. [they have] been quietly urging Zelensky to find a
way to end the war â€” even by resigning himself, if necessary â€” and to
allow the process of rebuilding his nation to get under way.  Zelensky
is not budging, according to intercepts and other data known inside
the Central Intelligence Agency, but he is beginning to lose the
private support of his neighbors"

Cleantech: "Last November Governor Reeves proudly announced that
Indiana-based Steel Dynamics is pumping $2.5 billion into an expansion
of its existing campus in Mississippi...

Hy Stor first proposed a green hydrogen hub for Mississippi back in 2021. 
Under the name Mississippi Clean Hydrogen Hub (MCHH), the project
leverages Hy Storâ€™s underground salt formations for storing
hydrogen gas in bulk, produced only from renewable resources. Hydrogen
functions as an energy carrier, so the bulk storage angle would
effectively provide steel makers and other industrial users with
reliable, 24/7 access to renewable energy...

Despite all anti-ESG posturing, Governor Reeves enthusiastically
endorsed the project in a hearty letter of support addressed to US
Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in October of 2021"

Part of ESG is "dumb green" projects eg electrification, batteries,
battery-electric cars. Clean fuels should not be bundled together with
them. H2, NH3 approach can scale, is open to both old and new
participants in the industry.

Oz Independent MP Chaney: "We need to have a broader conversation
about housing affordability, everyone wants the value of their home to
stay high, they also want their kids to be able to afford a house one
day. There is a fundamental disconnect here. We have to be able to
talk about things like negative gearing, capital gains tax, as well as
supply-side issues rather than continuing just responding with more
popular demand side injections of additional funds that just drive the
prices further up" \#ABC

"Thanks to the fleet of the first world-class and top-ranked EuroHPC
supercomputers, European scientists and industry are increasingly
processing their data inside the EU. Such a trend is not only
advancing science and boosting the innovation potential of companies
and SMEs in Europe, but is also reinforcing the protection of the
privacy, data protection, commercial trade secrets and ownership of
data in Europe"

Ivo Labbe: "â€˜We just discovered the impossibleâ€™: how giant baby
galaxies are shaking up our understanding of the early Universe.. I
run the analysis software.. and it spits out two numbers: distance
13.1 billion light years, mass 100 billion stars, and I nearly spit
out my coffee. We just discovered the impossible. Impossibly early,
impossibly massive galaxies.

At this distance, the light took 13 billion years to reach us, so we
are seeing the galaxies at a time when the universe was only 700
million years old, barely 5% of its current age of 13.8 billion
years. If this is true, this galaxy has formed as many stars as our
present-day Milky Way. In record time.

And where there is one, there are more. One day later I had found six"

Newsfile: "First Hydrogen.. confirms its hydrogen-fuel-cell powered
light commercial vehicles (LCV) are performing even better than
predicted. In the first phase of commissioning, the Company's LCVs
accumulated 6,000 km on UK roads, including mileage around London's
M25 motorway. The data logging supports vehicle range simulations,
which exceed a 500 km range. The vehicle is currently performing with
excellent efficiency, including both urban, extra-urban (which
includes driving at higher speeds) and highway operations. First
Hydrogen's LCV fuel consumption figures seen in many driving scenarios
are under 2 kg / 100 km, and in mostly urban driving this is 1.5 kg /
100 km"

Blackwater, Wagner are somewhat different, they are private, have
members from all walks of life as with the French Foreign Legion but
in a war Wagner they would, should fit in a hierarchy somewhere. RSF
has been that alternative "second military" for a long time now,
actively toppling, helping form new governments. They are used to
having access to power.

---

Former Sudan prez Bashir created the second group RSF as a Praetorian
Guard, who later turned on him. RSF grew in size and capability over
the years now rivaling the real military SAF itself.

Easier said than done especially when there are two militaries instead
of one to deal with.

For anyone who wants to read an accurate account of how open-source,
as in **free** software, made inroads into the industry, should check
Chris Anderson's excellent book *Free*. CA details Microsoft's
experience with open source through psychiatrist Elisabeth KÃ¼bler's
famous Five Stages of Grief. In the end, Stage 5 - Acceptance: Gates
and Ballmer took their best shot and had their ass handed to
them. Open source could not be quashed, and it has been growing ever
since.

The Times of India: "Green hydrogen: India is betting big on making a
transition towards renewable energy and reducing dependence on fossil
fuels, and one key factor in this is green hydrogen. According to
theÂ National Green Hydrogen Mission, by 2030 India hopes to
developÂ green hydrogen productionÂ capacity of at least 5 MMT per
annum"

Earth.org: "US military pollution is a significant contributor to
climate change. If it were a nation state, it would be the 47th
largest emitter in the world... The Cost of Wars Project found thatÂ US
military pollution had accounted for 1.2 billion metric tons of
greenhouse gas emissions, which amount to 257 million passenger cars
annually. They compared this astonishing output as higher than the
emissions from whole countries like Sweden, Morocco, and Switzerland"

Earth.org: "In 2017, the US Naval Air Station Oceana in Norfolk, VA
was found to have spilled 84,000 gallons of jet fuel into a
waterway. Similarly, in 2019, statistics arose claiming that the Air
Force contractor had been dumping industrial solvent Trichloroethylene
(TCE) into the ground surrounding the Tucson International Airport for
29 years. It was found that over 1,350 residents suffered from cancer
and other illnesses, due to these negligent actions"

Renew Economy: "South Australia swamped with nearly 30 proposals for
world leading green hydrogen plan.. The state Labor government has
committed nearly $600 million to build a 250MW green hydrogen
electrolyser and a 200MW green hydrogen power plant in the steel city
of Whyalla. Both would be the biggest of their type in the world, at
least for a time.

The guarantee of government funds for first of its type projects has
naturally attracted huge interest from Australia and around the
world. The government received around 60 expressions of interest last
year, which have converted into 29 formal proposals under a tender
that closed last week"

Some in the West are playing both sides? Good catch by \#TFIGlobal

FT: "More than $1bn of EU exports targeted by sanctions have
disappeared in transit to Russiaâ€™s economic partners, a flow of 'ghost
trade' that western officials believe has helped sustain Vladimir
Putinâ€™s wartime economy.

Public data analysed by the Financial Times found that only about half
of a $2bn sample of controlled 'dual use' items shipped from the EU
actually reached their stated destinations in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan
and Armenia.

These goods, which are deemed by the EU to have potential uses for
military or intelligence services and are subject to export controls,
may have entered Russia directly from the EU under the pretence that
they were only passing through"

TDB: "Special Counsel John Durhamâ€™s report on the FBIâ€™s investigation
into Donald Trumpâ€™s 2016 presidential campaign criticized the agency
for acting on 'raw, unanalyzed, and uncorroborated
intelligence.'.. CNN anchor Jake Tapper claimed Monday that the report
by Durham is 'devastating' to the organization and even exonerates
Trump 'to a degree.'"

"With its benign location and natural resources, Mexico has high hopes
for hydrogen. It could attract investments of around $60bn and
generate around 3 million jobs â€“ but for that to happen, a number of
key obstacles need to be overcome [around cert, reg]... 'we are at the
perfect time to move towards this transformation; since it is
estimated that by 2030 inÂ MexicoÂ the production of green hydrogen
could have lower costs by up to 64% compared to other countries that
do not have the same energy potential, we also have a privileged
location, which allows us to obtain solar and wind energy, from which
green hydrogen is generated,' added [an expert]"

If Ukraine followed the Minsk aggrement, the areas under RU influence
then were smaller than the areas controlled by Russia now. So overall,
this avoidable war has been a net loss for UA. Was the effort worth
it, other than serving Western interests "to contain Russia"?

The find is in the Haftar controlled region (Gen Haftar is supported
by Russia).

TechXplore: "Navid Attarzadeh first noticed the prickly pear cactus
while walking to UTEP's Center for Advanced Materials Research
lab. The team had been exploring nickel as a catalytic replacement for
platinum, a metal that is abundant on Earth.. Nickel, however, is not
as quick and effective at breaking down water into hydrogen.

'Every day, I passed this same plant,' said Attarzadeh, a doctoral
student in environmental science and engineering. 'And I started
connecting it to our catalyst problem. What caught my attention was
how big the leaves and fruits were compared to other desert plants;
the prickly pear has an extraordinary surface area.'

That's when the Attarzadeh had an idea. What if they designed a 3D
nickel-based catalyst in the shape of the prickly pear cactus? The
larger surface area could accommodate more electrochemical
reactionsâ€”creating moreÂ hydrogenÂ than nickel typically can. The team
quickly designed the nano-scale structureâ€”invisible to the human
eyeâ€”and put it to the test. 'We tested the catalyst's ability to split
water repeatedly and had good results'"
