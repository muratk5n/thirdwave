"With its benign location and natural resources, Mexico has high hopes
for hydrogen. It could attract investments of around $60bn and
generate around 3 million jobs – but for that to happen, a number of
key obstacles need to be overcome [around cert, reg]... 'we are at the
perfect time to move towards this transformation; since it is
estimated that by 2030 in Mexico the production of green hydrogen
could have lower costs by up to 64% compared to other countries that
do not have the same energy potential, we also have a privileged
location, which allows us to obtain solar and wind energy, from which
green hydrogen is generated,' added [an expert]"

If Ukraine followed the Minsk aggrement, the areas under RU influence
then were smaller than the areas controlled by Russia now. So overall,
this avoidable war has been a net loss for UA. Was the effort worth
it, other than serving Western interests "to contain Russia"?

The find is in the Haftar controlled region (Gen Haftar is supported
by Russia).

Al Monitor: "Russia's Tatneft makes new oil discovery in
Libya.. Libya's state-owned National Oil Corporation and Tatneft said
they discovered the oil in the Ghadames basin 330 [km] south of the
capital Tripoli at a depth of 8,500 feet. The amount of oil that can
be extracted amounts to 1,870 barrels per day"

TechXplore: "Navid Attarzadeh first noticed the prickly pear cactus
while walking to UTEP's Center for Advanced Materials Research
lab. The team had been exploring nickel as a catalytic replacement for
platinum, a metal that is abundant on Earth.. Nickel, however, is not
as quick and effective at breaking down water into hydrogen.

'Every day, I passed this same plant,' said Attarzadeh, a doctoral
student in environmental science and engineering. 'And I started
connecting it to our catalyst problem. What caught my attention was
how big the leaves and fruits were compared to other desert plants;
the prickly pear has an extraordinary surface area.'

That's when the Attarzadeh had an idea. What if they designed a 3D
nickel-based catalyst in the shape of the prickly pear cactus? The
larger surface area could accommodate more electrochemical
reactions—creating more hydrogen than nickel typically can. The team
quickly designed the nano-scale structure—invisible to the human
eye—and put it to the test. 'We tested the catalyst's ability to split
water repeatedly and had good results'"

Renew Economy: "Fortescue Future Industries has offered a first
glimpse of Australia's first electrolyser manufacturing facility,
posting a picture of the shiny new facility on LinkedIn this week...
Once fully operational, the $114 million project will produce 2GW of
electrolysers per year, which are in high demand as a critical
technology needed to produce 100% renewable \#GreenHydrogen."

R. Reich could be right; celebs doesn't want a blue check but e-jagoff
gave them one anyway paying out of pocket indicating celeb paid and
endorsed the gonzo system when they didn't, isn't that fraud under the
FTC Act? Past deeds as CEO might warrant investigation.

It gets even better; pesticide DDT is banned in US but you might buy
an apple shipped from another country produced via the DDT which US
sold them. Ain't that grand? Bidness makes money one way or
another. People also get poisoned, one way or another.

Paper: "US allows the production and export of pesticides to low- and
middle-income countries.. even when those pesticides have been banned
domestically due to their known detrimental health impacts"
