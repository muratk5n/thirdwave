data into a black box. This is the way.</p>
<p>TU Munchen: "Researchers.. have developed a model that enables a robot
to serve tea and coffee faster and more safely than humans – with no
sloshing... They based their mathematics on a Moroccan tea tray that
applies the principle of a spherical pendulum.. embed[ding] the
dynamics of a spherical pendulum into the robot’s control
software. That also means that the robot’s movements are limited by
the basic principles of geometry. With his team, he also integrates
the correct angles, speeds and accelerations into the model"</p>

<p>Calcium carbonate is sedimentary rock, iron oxide is a component of
igneous rock. Water can certainly seep down from ocean floor, and
combine with the rest.</p>
<hr />
<p>This means there is no need for 'fossils' for the production of
hydrocarbons, simple compounds present in the mantle at high pressure
/ temparature will do.</p>
<p>"[2004] We present in situ observations of hydrocarbon formation via
carbonate reduction at upper mantle pressures and
temperatures. Methane was formed from FeO, CaCO3-calcite, and water at
pressures between 5 and 11 GPa and temperatures ranging from 500°C to
1,500°C... The study demonstrates the existence of abiogenic pathways
for the formation of hydrocarbons in the Earth's interior and suggests
that the hydrocarbon budget of the bulk Earth may be larger than
conventionally assumed"</p>

<p>Russia was being shelled in Kherson City, they pulled out, Ukraine
moved in, now they are being shelled by Russian forces \(ツ)/ eyyy
(medi shrug). The river line proved to be defensible. UA
counteroffensive there stalled.</p>
<hr />
<p>BKM is major strat point; Ukraine sacrificed much to hold on to it..
One could even argue the counteroffensive last year was done partly to
shift the focus elsewhere when the battle there was not going well.</p>
<p>But things are now back to where they were; RU shored up the South, 
and now moving ahead with plans taking the rest of Donetsk.</p>
<hr />
<p>Latest frontline in Ukraine (in red), compared to 2022/11
(gray). Gains in Soledar, also south of Bakhmut. RU will surely
attempt to encircle BKM. Some gains in Zaporizhia too?  The start of
something from there perhaps, with plans of pushing towards the north.</p>

Rome, an expansionist band of feudal cobsuckers.</p>

<p>Hand crafted code could have its own issues, but NN based approaches
are especially fragile, they are too dependent on data - data that is
curated for a specific purpose.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes BD control code is hand-crafted. Preferable than neural net based
"AI", at least they are trying to formulate an approach from ground
up, thinking about the problem, not blindly showing in data into a
black box.</p>
<p>Quora: "How does Boston Dynamics use AI/machine learning? For the most
part, it doesn't. Boston Dynamic's secret sauce is a “stack” of very
carefully hand-designed classic control laws... It's good because
classic control theory provides strong mathematical guarantees of
stability and performance, and this does not require <em>any</em>
'training'. It just works, right out of the box, assuming you get the
control design right.. Nobody has yet figured out how to apply machine
learning to robotic motor control in a practical way. Machine learning
takes far too much data, typically hundreds of thousands to millions
of trials. You can't collect that much data on a real robot. And
simulation isn't good enough, yet, for simulated data to transfer
without change onto real robotic hardware"</p>
