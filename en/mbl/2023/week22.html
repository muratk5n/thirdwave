<p>"Government should spend less to avert inflation". That is trickery to
deflect attention away from the private sector to the government. Gov
has been spending for decades before covid and there's been no
inflation. Credit for private firms however, is more likely to be the
cause of rises in prices. Right-wing looves credit for businesses,
they don't want it to end. It's their baby milk. They need to be fed
with it constantly.</p>
<hr />
<p>A major divide in US revolves around who to be wary againts; the
government or private sector? Governments can make war, an awesome
power, but their war machine is ultimately tied to the needs of the
private sector, and the needs of private finance. I'd be warier
against the private sector. The government did not pollute the Hudson
River, or derail your trains in Ohio. Through action, and inaction the
private sector did.</p>

<p>Huawei is definitely a-noid</p>
<p>Quora: "[Huawei was] forced to develop Harmony OS because the US
government banned American companies from working with Huawei

working on an operating system of their own called Harmony OS. They
eventually had to switch over from Android to Harmony OS and now it's
being used"</p>

<p>Now they blame Putin of course for doing something they themselves
would have done <em>ten times over</em> had the situation been reversed, if
not preemptively. Forget Soviets around Cuba in 1962, how did US
handle the French in Mexico in 1861? That's right - not well, not with
open arms.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Bosnian situation in the 90s was bad no doubt, and at that stage
the sides weren't that clear cut either, Iran sent fighters to fight
in Bosnia against the Serbs. But we don't know how things reached that
stage. Muckers muck it up, we saw how what they did in Ukraine.. CIA
stirs shit up what do we have 10 years later? And that is a country
with only two groups which are ethnically, religiously, culturally
similar. Imagine what they could do in a country that has many groups
with major religious, ethnics differences.</p>
<hr />
<p>Unsurprisingly US is for Kosovo indep, Russia, China against. Just saw
a CH spox talking about "the territorial integrity of Serbia" by which
they mean Kosovo being part of Serbia. Kosovo is mostly ethnically
Albanian, 90%. Serbs 5%.</p>
<hr />
<p>Serbia is a long-time Russia ally. It looks as if the current map was
created to cut off Serbia from the Adriatic. Serbia and Montanegro
were united before, but Montanegro broke up in 2006. Kosovo declared
independence in 2008 (which Serbia doesn't recognize). Pieces of them
got chopped off, year after year. They got cucked.</p>

urged the Taliban to respect Iran's water rights from the Helmand
River under a 1973 treaty between the two countries, which entitles
Iran to receive 820 million cubic meters of water from the river per
year.</p>
<p>He added that in addition to the dams built along the Helmand River in
the past, the Taliban has constructed new ones to 'prevent the river's

<p>In the end, the vote is a referandum on the incumbent; voters
primarily vote on their well-being, pocketbook, and tend to reelect
the incumbent. The incumbency advantage should wear off as time goes
on but in tigger case IMO frequent "outside interventions" constantly
renewed the incumbency advantage for Tayyeap, the last one being in
2016 (likely attempted by fools partly egged on by gov itself but
anyway). Polls suggest the undecideds overwhelmingly went for the
incumbent in the eleventh hour, that suggest the incumbency advantage
persists.</p>

<p>Candidate-wise; the current Stanpoli mayor from the opposition could
fare a little better, but he made an ass of himself by associating
with elitist/neolib scum types near election prep, leaving himself
open to attacks - one came in the form of a court case that put his
candidacy in question.</p>
<hr />
<p>TR opposition loses again but their PR work was better this time
around. Assuming the election was legit (some claim there is 2-3%
potential for gov to 'create' votes), they likely fell short on
immigration, and in the last stretch leaned on too heavily on
nationalism judging the third guy with 5% took that share because of
nat rhetoric. That was a mistake. Plus the anti-Russki narrative was
unnecessary, RU was already supportive of current gov, but the added
antagonism would not help, made opposition look like a undiplomatic
neophytes.</p>
<p>It looks like Putin provided direct aid in the form of natgas payments
for the election (residential natgas bill for entire month of May was
zero), and the grain deal renewal gave a PR win for the gov, announced
right after the first round.</p>

<p>H2 Central: "While many carbon capture technologies target a 90-96%
capture rate, the 8RH2 oxy-combustion process will eliminate virtually
all direct CO2 emissions. Unlike standard hydrogen production, 8RH2
uses natural gas and pure oxygen and then utilizes the CO2 produced in
the combustion process as a heat transfer medium in a proprietary
reformer before sequestering the CO2. 8RH2‘s advanced process
eliminates the need for costly amine or cryogenic-based CO2 separation
processes that are normally required to capture CO2, as carbon
separation is inherent to the process itself"</p>
