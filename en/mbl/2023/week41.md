.. Mississippi \#River dredged to make it suitable for larger ships. The
Army Corps of Engineers has known for decades that its continual
efforts to deepen the #Mississippi River for bigger ships would
eventually trigger the #saltwater crisis that has now gripped the New
Orleans area for weeks"

Never forget that when Seoul, Korea removed the Cheonggyecheon
expressway in 2003 and replaced it with a restored stream, 1000 acre
park and improved transit, not only did it transform the cityâ€™s public
life & economic success, but the traffic got better.

The traffic got BETTER"

efforts... UAE, Malaysia sign $8bn renewable energy
agreement.. Malaysian experts see the UAE â€” a major oil producer which
in recent years has become a leader in developing renewable energy and
green hydrogen technologies â€” as a natural partner to help the

Now that I think about it, most of my DIY tools are read-heavy,
lookups, mapping so forth requiring minimal data in the background,
retrievable in a single JSON file pull. Javascript can handle that on
its sleep. Settings stored in a cookie => no complex server infra
needed. That gives me ideas.. ðŸ¤”

Got me some sour red cabbage. Coupled with some jar cooked steak - dam.

Apparently the firing had to do with "conflict of interest" issues
during privatization days in Russia in the 90s. These Clinton people
are up to their neck with Russia Russia Russia, while oligarchs were
destroying the country some might have benefited via kickbacks. I'm
sure that's why they took up to Russiagate so eagerly, it was the
ultimate misdirection, and a great excuse to cover up an embarrasing
loss to a former game show host.

He might be a little butthurt for being fired from there

Politico: "Lawrence Summers.. criticize[s] Harvard for student statement
blaming Israel"

---

Arab News: Israel is 'entirely responsible for all unfolding
violence,' and the attacks by Hamas 'did not happen in a vacuum,' 31
Harvard student organizations have said. Releasing a 'Joint Statement
by Harvard Palestine Solidarity Groups on the Situation in Palestine,'
the organizations said Israel had forced Palestinians to live in an
'open-air prison for over two decades.' The statement added: 'The
apartheid regime is the only one to blame. Israeli violence has
structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 years'"

Academic/Activist Randa Abdel-Fattah: "Palestinians have tried every
single avenue [to resist non-violently]. BDS is a peaceful movement
that was called by the civil society. It is criminalized in the US. I
just got back from there, and we would had panel discussions, they
tried to shut us down. We protest, 8000 people in the Great March of
Return [in Gaza], protested peacefully, we were shot at with live
ammunition. We go to social media, and advocate there, we get shut
out, silenced on social media. Every single avenue - international law
for instance, US will veto and shut that route down. All these
peaceful avenues are pursued by Palestinians and that is never good
enough. No form of resistance is good enough, it is only acceptable if
you are a dead Palestinian"

"@wilbr@glitch.social

'Israel's right to exist' is curious framing I hear often. If armed
water defenders broke out of an Indian Reservation and attacked a
nearby US town I wouldn't be talking about America's 'right to
exist.'.. Billions of dollars a year & millions of people say Israel
will continue existing in some form. The question is if Netanyahu's
government and policies should exist, and what equitable truth &
reconciliation would look like for Palestinians...

The idea that the only possible way to allow the victims of genocide
to survive is to just straight up give them the cities and houses of
Palestinians doesn't set up conditions for justice, and continued
blockading and encroachment ditching Palestine into smaller and more
impoverished areas with random (and daily) escalatory violence just
pours salt in the wound. The West created a messed up situation and
finances its right-wing government's activities. Arabs pay the price,
as we see so often"

The Lever: "Insurers Are Gaming Medicare â€” To The Tune Of $140
Billion.. The federal government is losing as much as 140 billion
dollars per year by subsidizing private Medicare Advantage plans,
according to a bombshell new report. In the groundbreaking
investigation, health care researchers identified the four major ways
that private insurers systematically exploit the taxpayer-funded
national health insurance program while denying care to the nationâ€™s
most vulnerable patients"

"@Linux_Is_Best@mastodon.social

Microsoft, quietly, has published a guide on how to download and
install Linux.

No... Seriously... It is not a joke...

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/linux/install

The article was published September 29, 2023 (9 days ago).

The guide provides every option available, too. Starting with using
their Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), to using a Virtual Machine,
and even on "Bare Metal" alongside Windows.

That's right, Microsoft now tells you how to dual-boot Linux. ðŸ¤¯"

NYT: "E-Bikes Are Convenient. They Can Also Cause Fatal Fires... Just
before midnight on a Friday in January, a fire tore through a
three-story house in East Elmhurst, Queens, injuring 10 people inside
and killing a 63-year-old man who was trapped on the second
floor. Five days later, on a rainy Wednesday afternoon, another fire
broke out in the basement of a house in Forest Hills, Queens, where an
unauthorized day care center was housed. Eighteen children were
injured, one seriously.

The cause of both fires was rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which
power the e-bikes and e-scooters that have become ubiquitous on city
streets.. [but] deadly, unintended consequence has emerged: Storing
and charging such bikes and scooters indoors can create a
tinderbox. Last year, the batteries caused 216 fires, with 147
injuries and six deaths. As of Feb. 27 this year, they were
responsible for 30 fires, 40 injuries and two deaths, according to the
Fire Department"

Stiglitz: "One of battles has been with IMF when they wanted to change
their charter to force developing countries to have capital market
liberalization. When the IMF was founded in 1944 with Keynes, Keynes
did not believe in capital market liberalization. So the institution he
helped create [.. some years later] stabbed him in the back"

NYT: "Gaza Has Suffered Under 16-Year Blockade.. Held in place by
Israel and Egypt, the blockade restricts imports to the region and

Stiglitz: "Neoliberalism.. assumed away market imperfections (like
imperfections in information and imperfect risk markets)... 

With imperfect risk markets, trade liberalization could make everyone
in every country worse off.

With imperfect capital markets, capital market liberalization may be
welfare [as in standard of living] decreasing"

"Invading by land air and sea".. sea is a dinky boat, air is a dude on
paraglider.. If they cause X amt of casualties Israel will cause 10X,
via real sea, real land, and real air force on an area that is
already an open-air prison.

Attacks from Gaza should be seen as prison riots rather than an
independent sovereign actor's atttacks on a neighbor.
