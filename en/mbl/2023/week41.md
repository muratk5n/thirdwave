Greener)...  Photoelectrochemical cells can push green hydrogen
directly from water without the need for standalone solar
panels... The Intertubes have been burning up with news of the first
billion-dollar unicorn to emerge from the boiling stew of green
hydrogen startups... Last week, a US startup called Electric Hydrogen
raised 380 million in a Series C round of funding on the basis of
building a better electrolyzer.  That raised the companyâ€™s valuation
over the $1 billion bar, earning it the title of the industryâ€™s first
unicorn"

NYT: "'[E]nmity toward Israel over its decades-long occupation of
their land' remained strong, particularly as Israel's government
expanded settlements in the Palestinian West Bank after the
agreements. On Saturday, when Palestinian gunmen from the blockaded
territory of Gaza surged into Israel, carrying out the boldest attack
in the country in decades, it set off an outpouring of support for the
Palestinians across the region. In some quarters, there were
celebrations even as hundreds of Israelis and Palestinians were
killed... Demonstrations in solidarity with the Palestinians took
place across the region, including in Bahrain, Morocco, Turkey, Yemen,
Tunisia and Kuwait..

[I]n Egypt's coastal city of Alexandria, a policeman opened fire on
Israeli tourists, killing two Israelis and an Egyptian.The ripples
spreading from Gaza underscored what many officials, scholars and
citizens in the region have been saying for years: The Palestinian
cause is still a deeply felt rallying cry that shapes the contours of
the Middle East, and Israel's position in the region will remain
unstable as long as its conflict with the Palestinians continues"

Apparently the firing had to do with "conflict of interest" issues
during privatization days in Russia in the 90s. These Clinton people
are up to their neck with Russia Russia Russia, while oligarchs were
destroying the country some might have benefited via kickbacks. I'm
sure that's why they took up to Russiagate so eagerly, it was the
ultimate misdirection, and a great excuse to cover up an embarrasing
loss to a former game show host.

'open-air prison for over two decades.' The statement added: 'The
apartheid regime is the only one to blame. Israeli violence has
structured every aspect of Palestinian existence for 75 years'"

Academic/Activist Randa Abdel-Fattah: "Palestinians have tried every
single avenue [to resist non-violently]. BDS is a peaceful movement
that was called by the civil society. It is criminalized in the US. I
just got back from there, and we would had panel discussions, they
tried to shut us down. We protest, 8000 people in the Great March of
Return [in Gaza], protested peacefully, we were shot at with live
ammunition. We go to social media, and advocate there, we get shut
out, silenced on social media. Every single avenue - international law
for instance, US will veto and shut that route down. All these
peaceful avenues are pursued by Palestinians and that is never good
enough. No form of resistance is good enough, it is only acceptable if
you are a dead Palestinian"

"@wilbr@glitch.social

'Israel's right to exist' is curious framing I hear often. If armed
water defenders broke out of an Indian Reservation and attacked a
nearby US town I wouldn't be talking about America's 'right to
exist.'.. Billions of dollars a year & millions of people say Israel
will continue existing in some form. The question is if Netanyahu's
government and policies should exist, and what equitable truth &
reconciliation would look like for Palestinians...

The idea that the only possible way to allow the victims of genocide
to survive is to just straight up give them the cities and houses of
Palestinians doesn't set up conditions for justice, and continued
blockading and encroachment ditching Palestine into smaller and more
impoverished areas with random (and daily) escalatory violence just
pours salt in the wound. The West created a messed up situation and
finances its right-wing government's activities. Arabs pay the price,
as we see so often"

and even on "Bare Metal" alongside Windows.

NYT: "E-Bikes Are Convenient. They Can Also Cause Fatal Fires... Just
before midnight on a Friday in January, a fire tore through a
three-story house in East Elmhurst, Queens, injuring 10 people inside
and killing a 63-year-old man who was trapped on the second
floor. Five days later, on a rainy Wednesday afternoon, another fire
broke out in the basement of a house in Forest Hills, Queens, where an
unauthorized day care center was housed. Eighteen children were
injured, one seriously.

The cause of both fires was rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, which
power the e-bikes and e-scooters that have become ubiquitous on city
streets.. [but] deadly, unintended consequence has emerged: Storing
and charging such bikes and scooters indoors can create a
tinderbox. Last year, the batteries caused 216 fires, with 147
injuries and six deaths. As of Feb. 27 this year, they were
responsible for 30 fires, 40 injuries and two deaths, according to the
Fire Department"
