Euractiv: "France asks [Azerbaijan] to restore â€˜unhinderedâ€™ movement on vital corridor"

But of course they do

Al-Monitor: "[2023/03] Israel exports arms to Azerbaijan as tensions
soar with Armenia"

---

Where is the good ol' genocide victim symphaty when you need it eh?
Israel gets it, forgiveness in all kinds of world affairs, why not
Armenia?

Aw darn - they have relations with Russia, that's the problem. In that
case your victimization counts less.. Israel's matters more because
they are on the *right side*, the tip of the spear for "Anglo designs"
in the region. We hyperventilate about theirs, not about Armenia bcz
they are not US', Britain's bitch.

It was at the Lachin Corridor

Reuters: "Azerbaijan said it had established a checkpoint on the road
leading to Karabakh, a step it said was essential due to what it cast
as Armenia's use of the road to transport weapons"

A lot of ppl in analytics do not seem to have mastered the dark arts
of incremental processing; Do not bring *da entire* input file in
memory, keep *da entire* output in memory before writing it to file,
read piecemeal, write piecemeal, while keeping only the bare minimum,
bare essentials in RAM. A lot of algorithms can be coded this way.

A quick history lesson. From 1940-1980:

â€¢Wealthiest paid 70-94% marginal tax

â€¢0 of them went broke from taxation

â€¢0 of them left USA

â€¢All remained exceedingly wealthy

â€¢Manufacturing boomed

â€¢The middle class was 62% of US economy (It's now 40% post 'trickle
 down scamenomics)"

"A new dawn for hydrogen mobility in Europe.. With the EUâ€™s commitment
to hydrogen stations every 200km on major roads, the industry now sees
a positive sign to push forward with the development of a hydrogen
mobility ecosystem"

The best things in life are free

Data Scientist: "My custom [code] uses high resolution radar data
collected in 2000 by the Space Shuttle Endeavor. For about 18GB of
hard drive space, the SRTM GL3 dataset covers nearly 120M square
kilometers of Earthâ€™s landmass in 90m increments... It is interesting
to note that Google currently charges $5 per 1000 requests to their
Elevation API, but thanks to NASA and a few lines of code, we can get
the same high-quality results, free of charge"

Teenage kid made a sailboat voyage around the world, the logistics:
had Internet, sat phone, a ton of food tinned, 500+ chocolates, 200+
Easy Food vacuum cooked ready meals, lamb chops - as in full-blown
meals. Then save for the occasional physical labor required to direct
the ship it's mostly being rocked and it's mostly enjoying the view
and sometimes being bored. It's like a teenager room on the move, wout
the parents. And later she goes on to become a bleeping management
consultant, and her former sail buddy boyfriend dies on her? Sad.

Not much news about helium-cooled nuke plants of Japan lately, what
happened? They were supposed to be 100% safe, use a fission fuel tech
named TRISO have better waste management capabilities, and will be
generating H2 efficiently. Is the tech still being pursued?

*The Precariat*: "In the 1970s, a group of ideologically inspired
economists captured the ears and minds of politicians. The central
plank of their â€˜neo-liberalâ€™ model was that growth and development
depended on market competitiveness; everything should be done to
maximise competition and competitiveness, and to allow market
principles to permeate all aspects of life.

One theme was that countries should increase labour market
flexibility, which came to mean an agenda for transferring risks and
insecurity onto workers and their families. The result has been the
creation of a global â€˜precariatâ€™, consisting of many millions around
the world without an anchor of stability. They are becoming a new
dangerous class. They are prone to listen to ugly voices, and to use
their votes and money to give those voices a political platform of
increasing influence. The very success of the â€˜neo-liberalâ€™ agenda,
embraced to a greater or lesser extent by governments of all
complexions, has created an incipient political monster. Action is
needed before that monster comes to life"

The COVID national emergency was ended in Apr 11, could've been to
stave off \#RK attacks on that issue. Is the Biden team worried?

---

\#RFKj is clearly a Trump-inspired Kennedy.

These people come out of the woodwork.. there is a Kennedy for every
kind of political situation, any shape, size; there is a tall Kennedy,
a short Kennedy, I'm sure if the situation called for it there is a
midget Kennedy somewhere. Biden made a mistake building up the
family's image, the myth, hoping to gain legitimacy by displaying a
connection to it, but then the genuine item can show up and gobble up
your shit. Now \#RK says in an interview "Biden has my father's bust
behind him in every WH picture" so you handed a Kennedy an advantage -
why bother with the guy merely standing in front of the bust when
there is the actual son in the running?

Multiculturalism is a nice word but it never works - in one generation
the migrant assimilates. Why bother with mumbling stupid shit shaking
lanterns with smoke coming out whatever. State psyop likes this biz
bcz it is in their interest to keep people seperate, disconnected -
it's a variation of divide-and-rule.

---

Every immigrant, minority brings some changes into the larger soc they
are in, in proportion to their population. 10% can effect 10%. But
subsequent generations get the whole thing, not just the 10%. "The
unblemished, unchanged migrant, minority" fallacy dictates minority
only learns its own minority culture not the whole. This is a foolish
fantasy. Do not raise your children this way, you will fail to effect
their culture anyway, and you can make them neurotic.

DroneDj: "DroneUp, the drone delivery company that Walmart is using,
says it plans to test new hydrogen fuel cell technology that has the
potential to increase a droneâ€™s flight time to two to five hours.

This fuel cell technology has been developed by South Koreaâ€™s Doosan
Mobility Innovation (DMI), which is also building one of the
first-ever open-source, hydrogen-fuel-cell powered motorcycles in
collaboration with [MIT]..

Compared to conventional lithium battery-powered drones, DMIâ€™s
hydrogen fuel cell technology yields 3-to-1 energy density
characteristics. So, with this tech, a small drone can fly anywhere
between two to five hours, depending on factors such as payload weight
and weather"

The RU animosity thing was mostly overblown too IMO, during Mao and
Xiaoping. They were playing you.

---

Now they are sufficiently developed, they can build their own tech,
for the rest can trade with Germany, Europe, whomever. They don't need
you anymore.

"China was entusiastic to show friendship to US during 1979 attacking
Vietnam to get tech / investment. Why are they giving cold shoulder to
us America now?"

Happy Anzac Day bitchez! (Apparently it's on April 25th)

---

Current Oz Labor gov is continuing the nuke sub deal AUKUS. A former
Labor leader [criticized](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2023/mar/15/paul-keating-labels-aukus-submarine-pact-worst-deal-in-all-history-in-attack-on-albanese-government)
the decision as "the 'worst deal in all history', because [the same money] could
buy 40 to 50 conventional submarines instead". He says, correctly,
conv subs are more than sufficient to defend Australia from attacking
navies. But of course that's not the point of the nuke sub deal. Nuke
subs are needed for attacking China, in their turf, and that's the point,
AUKUS isn't about direct homeland defense, it is about offense. You are
going Galipoli again, in return for a superpower help, just like during WWI,
1915 when you attacked a people with whom "you never had an angry word with".

---

The deaths of those soldiers did mean something, in strategic terms,
not in the way regular people understand war. Galipoli wasn't a case
of "I was attacked now I defend myself" it was a case of "I must
invade A who is part of alliance B because I need the protection of C
against some way distant future possibly invasion of X".

---

Anzac support was due to a security / neutrality trade-off for Oz; you
offer your services, in location, in human lives, to a superpower
(Britain then, US now) to get "protection" in return. The reason for
the Anzac rememberence rituals are kept alive today is to remind
people a similar sacrifice might be asked of them again.

---

When his Galipoli movie came out, Russell Crowe gave an interview, the
responses from people were interesting. Some were like 'Wut'? That is
a national narrative at work, they reside in subconcious, sit there as
unquestioned, banal conclusions. When questioned ppl are shocked.

---

There were New Zealanders in Anzac; the word is is an acronym for the
**A**ustralian and **N**ew **Z**ealand **A**rmy **C**orps. This piece
of history interests me obviously bcz Anzac were sent by Brits to
Galipoli attacking my hood.

H2 View: "A first shipment of independently-certified low-carbon
ammonia has been shipped from Saudi Arabia to Japan for use as fuel in
power generation.

<img width='340' src='https://thearabposts.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Saudi-arabia-8.jpg'/> 

The ammonia was produced by SABIC Agri-Nutrients (SABIC AN) with
feedstock from Aramco, and sold by Aramco Trading Company to the Fuji
Oil Company (FOC). Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) was tasked with shipping
the liquid to Japan, then the low-carbon ammonia was transported to
the Sodegaura Refinery for use in co-fired power generation, with
technical support provided by Japan Oil Engineering Co (JOE).

The ammonia is categorised as low-carbon because carbon dioxide (CO2)
from the associated manufacturing process was captured and utilised in
downstream applications"

Modern US liberalism can get delusional; it always had a subjective,
un-scientific bent, bizarre ideas about the self. Truly mambo-jambo
stuff, "new age", like "believing you can be, at an instant, however
you label yourself to be". How the flap can you will yourself to be a
man, or woman when you aren't? In own head fine but why inflict that
delusion on others?

JFK wasn't buttonholed into anything for the Bay of Pigs; he modified

CH attack was likely to entice US for econ help. Xiao wanted to give
Vietnam a visible spanking, a country which had only six years ago
managed to repel the Americans, to show that "see I'm hitting your
former enemy, also containing your Cold War opposition, therefore I'm
your friend".

---

*Deng Xiaoping's Long War*: "[Most scholars] do not elucidate why Deng
[Xiaoping] was so eager to inform the Carter administration of
Beijingâ€™s decision to attack Vietnam, something that normally would
only have happened between two closely allied countries..

Deng staked the success of economic reform on Western technology and
foreign investment, particularly from America. Dengâ€™s acceptance of
U.S. terms during the establishment of diplomatic relations between
the two countries in mid-Â­December 1978 was crucial in achieving these
two strategic objectives both externally and internally... Chinaâ€™s
decision to launch a punitive war against Vietnam was intended to
display Beijingâ€™s usefulness in countering Soviet expansionism. In
Dengâ€™s own words, China was 'a reliable friend,' and it therefore
deserved Western economic and technological assistance"

Most know about US Vietnam War, ended in 1973. Not paid attn to

capture, corporations, Ukraine, food stamp cuts, hits the right
