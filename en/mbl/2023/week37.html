<p>Remember the scene in <em>Toy Story</em> where Buzz Lightyear jumps in air
wanting to fly, but with a succession of accidents stays in the air
for a while, and declares he is flying. Another toy says to him "you
are not flying, you are falling with style". That is precisely what's
going on with these neural net "AI" approaches, LLMs - they are
stupid, but they are stupid with style, their output sometimes looks
intelligent, either by chance (stochastically) or through a 
phenomenon known as <a href="https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist">psychic's con</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>They are basically stupid</p>
<p>Melanie Mitchell: "Can Large Language Models Reason?.. [I]f LLMs rely
primarily on memorization and pattern-matching rather than true
reasoning, then they will not be generalizable—we can’t trust them to
perform well on 'out of distribution' tasks, those that are not
sufficiently similar to tasks they’ve seen in the training data...  If
LLMs Are Not Reasoning, What Are They Doing?..  Several researchers
have shown that LLMs are substantially better at solving problems that
involve terms or concepts that appear more frequently in their
training data, leading to the hypothesis that LLMs do not perform
robust abstract reasoning to solve problems, but instead solve
problems (at least in part) by identifying patterns in their training
data that match, or are similar to, or are otherwise related to the
text of the prompts they are given.</p>
<p>For example, a study by Razeghi et al. showed that some GPT-based LLMs
(pre-trained on a known corpus) were much better at arithmetic
problems that involved numbers that appeared frequently in the
pre-training corpus than those that appeared less frequently. These
models appear to lack a general ability for arithmetic, but instead
rely on a kind of “memorization”—matching patterns of text they have
seen in pre-training"</p>

covers a lot of ground.</p>

<p>We are talking about Chilean Air Force bombing the presidential
residence as part of a coup, photographed above. The date was
September 11, 1973, and the left-wing president Allende was
toppled. Pinochet would become president and usher in neo-liberal
reforms, jail opponents, opress political dissent. "Chicago Boys" were
asked to help, thanks to them, the new system would create inequality
and subsequently cause the 1982 monetary crisis.</p>
<p>September 11 for US was tragic too, but US reacted to it by telling
people "to shop more", and invaded a random country to benefit
Halliburton. Dare I say due to its actions US made its own 9/11 matter
less. From now on we will only commemorate the Chilean 9/11, not the
American one.</p>

<p>.. lest we interfere with crooked ass bidness in an "opressive" kinda
way. No cannot do that. The right-wing way is to have the mofo to
feast off public money even more, as if cheap energy, the infra they
live on was not enough.</p>

<p>Trump: "We know collective action can be incredibly effective. In
July, UPS agreed to a deal with the Teamsters Union in which, on
average, the annual salary of full-time drivers will be raised to
$170,000, including healthcare and other benefits.</p>
<p>What the rich and the politicians they own have succeeded in doing
since the Reagan administration, is convincing white working-class
Americans that unions are the enemy of working people, and
trickle-down economics (essentially tax cuts for the very rich) will,
counterintuitively, lead to economic equality. These are lies"</p>
