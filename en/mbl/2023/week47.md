The Guardian: "The European Union has become the first international
body to criminalise wide-scale environmental damage 'comparable to
ecocide'. Late on Thursday, lawmakers agreed an update to the bloc’s
environmental crime directive punishing the most serious cases of
ecosystem destruction, including habitat loss and illegal logging,
with tougher penalties. Marie Toussaint, a French lawyer and MEP
heading EU efforts to criminalise ecocide, said the decision 'marks
the end of impunity for environmental criminals' and could usher in a
new age of environmental litigation in Europe"

Ravi: "[Al Jazeera] On the question of Palestine India's independence
leaders Mahatma Ghandi and Nehru were vocal in their support. In 1936
when Palestinians rose up against the British and their push for a
Jewish state, Nehru compared Palestine with India under colonial
rule. He talked about gross betrayal of Arabs by the British
imperialism. 'Palestine was not an empty land, it was well populated
with little room for large numbers of colonists. Is it any wonder that
the Arabs objected to this intrusion?' A little more than 10 years
later when the UN voted to create the state of Israel, there were only
three non-Arab countries that voted against that resolution. India was
one of them"

Of course they can produce at scale. Does US think a few chips were
produced by some old kung-fu master in his basement with a side job on
chip making toiling away all his life and producing a few dozen?
Result of a lifetime of work.. But that's it! 🤨 That doesn't make
sense. How many of those phones were sold?

At scale ???

Yahoo Finance: "Commerce Secretary.. said she was 'upset' when China’s
Huawei Technologies Co. released a new phone with an advanced chip
during her visit to the country last month but noted that the US has
no evidence China can make those components 'at scale'"

H2 Central: "Lenten Scheepvaart (the Netherlands) will go down in
history as the owner of the world’s first-ever newbuild
hydrogen-powered inland shipping barge. With this, the shipping
company sets a new standard. An important step towards zero-emission
transport on Dutch inland waterways. The Hydrogen Electric Cargo Ship
‘Antonie’ (WEVA) was realised by Concordia Damen. On 23 October the
technical sea trials were held, during which the ship was inspected by
Lloyd’s Register and received a provisional certificate to be put into
service"
