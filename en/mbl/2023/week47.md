Most of the time, no it doesn't make sense for businesses to run like
a government.

Part of government services is that in order to actually cover 100% of
people, it's going to require massively overbuilding the
infrastructure to ensure that there's enough resources to handle even
the edge cases - despite the fact that those edge cases oftentimes
aren't 'profitable' to serve.

Take, for example, USPS vs FedEx. The remit of USPS is to deliver mail
to EVERY SINGLE ADDRESS IN THE COUNTRY. Yes, even the ones that
require taking a sea plane 500 miles into rural Alaska to serve a
village of a dozen customers. FedEx, on the other hand, will only
serve the addresses that it finds profitable to do so.

When conservatives want to 'government like a business', part of
what they're saying is that they simply want to not serve the parts of
the population that aren't 'profitable'. But profit should never be
the point of government services. It's defining what services are
worth providing to every single citizen, and ensuring that they're
delivered to them - yes, even the ones that are far more difficult to
provide"

ProPublica: "Over the last four decades,¬†states have enacted hundreds
of laws¬†dictating precisely what insurers must cover so that consumers
aren‚Äôt driven into debt or forced to go without medicines or
procedures. But health plans have violated these mandates at least
dozens of times in the last five years, ProPublica found"

SP 500 will go down to 4200 very soon if we are to follow "the FED
balance sheet drives all" maxim.

The Times of Israel: "Biden, for the first time, urged the
international community on Saturday to help manage the security of the
Gaza Strip for an interim period after the war, to be followed
eventually by Palestinian Authority governance"

---

The Times of Israel: "Biden threatens to issue visa
bans against extremist settlers carrying out violence against
Palestinians in the West Bank"

EU IR Rep Borell: "There is no hierarchy between horrors. One horror
does not justify another horror. And the pain that you inflict on
children of others, will not justify never, will not compensate the
pain your children have been suffering. On the contrary, it will
create a violent spiral that will come once again unless we got a
peace, a sustainable peace.

That is why the European Union has called for immediate humanitarian
pauses, and the United Nations Security Council.. adopted a very
important resolution asking for immediate, urgent and sustained
humanitarian pauses..

I want to remind that the decisions of UN Security Council are not
just words. They are compulsory, they have to be implemented.

But this resolution has not been implemented, not yet. To the
contrary, the bombing has continued. I have to recall that this
decision of the UN Security Council has to be implemented. Too many
lives are being lost every day"

The Guardian: "The European Union has become the first international
body to criminalise wide-scale environmental damage 'comparable to
ecocide'. Late on Thursday, lawmakers agreed an update to the bloc‚Äôs
environmental crime directive punishing the most serious cases of
ecosystem destruction, including habitat loss and illegal logging,
with tougher penalties. Marie Toussaint, a French lawyer and MEP
heading EU efforts to criminalise ecocide, said the decision 'marks
the end of impunity for environmental criminals' and could usher in a
new age of environmental litigation in Europe"

Ravi: "[Al Jazeera] On the question of Palestine India's independence
leaders Mahatma Ghandi and Nehru were vocal in their support. In 1936
when Palestinians rose up against the British and their push for a
Jewish state, Nehru compared Palestine with India under colonial
rule. He talked about gross betrayal of Arabs by the British
imperialism. 'Palestine was not an empty land, it was well populated
with little room for large numbers of colonists. Is it any wonder that
the Arabs objected to this intrusion?' A little more than 10 years
later when the UN voted to create the state of Israel, there were only
three non-Arab countries that voted against that resolution. India was
one of them"

Plus isn't the worry more on the military application than commerce?
Clearly they can produce plenty for any military need.

Reuters: "[10/19] China's Huawei sells 1.6 mln Mate 60 series"

---

Of course they can produce at scale. Does US think a few chips were
produced by some old kung-fu master in his basement with a side job on
chip making toiling away all his life and producing a few dozen?
Result of a lifetime of work.. But that's it! ü§® That doesn't make
sense. How many of those phones were sold?

---

At scale ???

Yahoo Finance: "Commerce Secretary.. said she was 'upset' when China‚Äôs
Huawei Technologies Co. released a new phone with an advanced chip
during her visit to the country last month but noted that the US has
no evidence China can make those components 'at scale'"

I guess the lodging, hospitality industry still isn't "disrupted", or

history as the owner of the world‚Äôs first-ever newbuild
hydrogen-powered inland shipping barge. With this, the shipping
company sets a new standard. An important step towards zero-emission
transport on Dutch inland waterways. The Hydrogen Electric Cargo Ship
‚ÄòAntonie‚Äô (WEVA) was realised by Concordia Damen. On 23 October the
technical sea trials were held, during which the ship was inspected by
Lloyd‚Äôs Register and received a provisional certificate to be put into
service"
