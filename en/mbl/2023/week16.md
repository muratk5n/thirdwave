UA took a stand at Bakhmut but that did not stop RU to advance in
areas to the North and South of it; see landmass taken past four
months, Krasnopolivka, Blahodatne are gone, RU is now approaching
Serebryanka.

```python
ps = ['Bakhmut','Serebryanka','Krasnopolivka','Blahodatne']
u.sm_plot_ukr('ukrdata/fl-0416.csv','ukrdata/fl-221115.csv',ps,clat=48,clon=37,zoom=0.1)
```

Russia now has the Bakhmut railway

The Iraq Study Group Report

[PDF](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-IRAQSTUDYGROUP/pdf/GPO-IRAQSTUDYGROUP.pdf)

---

The Doran article details how WH stuck to its Iran policy; and likely
forces both internal and external actively tried to undermine this
thawing of relations, and the conflict in ME became more complicated,
and deadly because of it. Secret intel sharing would complicate things
further and obviously help Assad.

Michael Doran: "When [Obama] arrived in Washington in 2006, he
absorbed a set of ideas that had incubated on Capitol Hill during the
previous three years—ideas that had received widespread attention
thanks to the final report of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan
congressional commission whose co-chairs, former secretary of state
James Baker and former Indiana congressman Lee Hamilton, interpreted
their mission broadly, offering advice on all key aspects of Middle
East policy.. The report, published in December 2006, urged
then-President Bush to take four major steps: withdraw American troops
from Iraq; surge American troops in Afghanistan; reinvigorate the
Arab-Israeli 'peace process'; and, last but far from least, launch a
diplomatic engagement of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its junior
partner, the Assad regime in Syria. Baker and Hamilton believed that
Bush stood in thrall to Israel and was therefore insufficiently alive
to the benefits of cooperating with Iran and Syria. Those two regimes,
supposedly, shared with Washington the twin goals of stabilizing Iraq
and defeating al-Qaeda and other Sunni jihadi groups. In turn, this
shared interest would provide a foundation for building a concert
system of states—a club of stable powers that could work together to
contain the worst pathologies of the Middle East and lead the way to a
sunnier future.

Expressing the ethos of an influential segment of the foreign-policy
elite, the Baker-Hamilton report became the blueprint for the foreign
policy of the Obama administration, and its spirit continues to
pervade Obama’s inner circle. Denis McDonough, now the president’s
chief of staff, once worked as an aide to Lee Hamilton; so did
Benjamin Rhodes, who helped write the Iraq Study Group’s report. Obama
not only adopted the blueprint but took it one step further,
recruiting Vladimir Putin’s Russia as another candidate for membership
in the new club. The administration’s early 'reset' with Russia and
its policy of reaching out to Iran and Syria formed two parts of a
single vision"

It's not too far fetched post 2013 admin helped Assad through
backchannels, closer rels with Iran, Syria, Russia were part of their
plan.

help put him back in the White House"

The Hydrogen Stream: "Global pipeline projects to surge by 2035, says
Rystad.. Rystad Energy said hydrogen pipeline projects could expand by
as much as 700% over the next 12 years. It said that more than 4,300
km of pipelines already transport hydrogen, with more than 90% of them
in Europe and North America. It estimates that there are about 91
planned pipeline projects throughout the world, with 30,300 kilometers
set to go online by around 2035. 'Spain, France, and Germany are among
the countries committed or considering cross-border pipelines to
facilitate energy flows, while the UK with its extensive gas grid
finds itself in a fantastic position to switch from natural gas to
hydrogen,' it noted"

The media guy Maxwell was in it, Ghishalashalaylay's father..
[This lady](ejagoffmaxwell2.jpg). He was portrayed as a
connected, scheming jerkoff, based on his biz history portrayal
looks correct.

It takes place pre-Perestroika, one gov official's line was the best
"it’s just a video game.. to you, yes, but to the men in power, it is
a slippery slope from selling one game to selling all of Russia to the
highest bidder".

And Russia was nearly sold to the highest bidder during the 90s,
wasn't it? That's how the world ended up with Putin.

Bertrand Russell: "Although this may seem a paradox, all exact science
is dominated by the idea of approximation. When a man tells you that
he knows the exact truth about anything, you are safe in inferring
that he is an inexact man"

According to Hersh Germans were instrumental in passing the intel to
Syria, in its fight against al Nusra and ISIS.

---

It may be possible WH knew..  The 2008-2016 Iran (Syrian friend)
raproachement efforts are well known; Let's also remember the
backtracking on the "red line" ultimatum.

They went behind Bama's back to give Assad intel on the opposition?
Quite a claim. 

Hersh, *The Killing of Osama bin Laden*: "The administration’s policy
was contradictory. They wanted Assad to go but the opposition was
dominated by extremists. So who was going to replace him?  To say
Assad’s got to go is fine, but if you follow that through—therefore
anyone is better. It’s the ‘anybody else is better’ issue that the JCS
had with Obama’s policy... The Joint Chiefs felt that a direct
challenge to Obama’s policy would have 'had a zero chance of success.'
So in the autumn of 2013 they decided to take steps against the
extremists without going through political channels, by providing US
intelligence to the militaries of other nations, on the understanding
that it would be passed on to the Syrian army and used against the
common enemy, Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State... 'Obama didn’t know,
but Obama doesn’t know what the JCS does in every circumstance, and
that’s true of all presidents' [an official said].
