# Week 50


The days of empire are over. Corporate muppets are running the show now.

---

It doesn't look like ICSID is essential for pulling foreign
investment, Brasil is out of this system and it gets FDI just fine.

---

A corp even once sued the Egyptian government for raising the minimum
wage through this bizarre arbitration system. Why have national
governments laws etc then? Just have these muckers write laws for you.

---

They've already done huge damage in El Salvador, South Africa...

---

A shady arbitration system ICSID, part of World Bank. Sounds
and is shady.. Unequal, opressive and an obstracle for developing
countries.

The Nation: "The 'Hunt for Hamas' Narrative Is Obscuring Israel’s Real
Plans for Gaza.. The US press and politicians are trying to fit the
attacks on Gaza into a Zero Dark Thirty mold, but it’s something much
simpler—and sinister... The government is doing forcible population
transfers, and this means everyone. It’s the simplest way to explain
Israel’s actions, yet American media—tied to 'counterterror'
narratives—can’t, or won’t, get their minds around the obvious fact
that Israel is attempting to depopulate Gaza in stages"

UK abstained? That's good for UK. The support from Japan is noteworthy.

AP News: "US vetoes UN resolution backed by many nations demanding
immediate humanitarian cease-fire in Gaza.. The council called the
emergency meeting to hear from Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who
for the first time invoked Article 99 of the U.N. Charter, which
enables a U.N. chief to raise threats he sees to international peace
and security...

The vote in the 15-member council was 13-1, with the United Kingdom
abstaining. The United States’ isolated stand reflected a growing
fracture between Washington and some of its closest allies over
Israel’s monthslong bombardment of Gaza. France and Japan were among
those supporting the call for a cease-fire"
