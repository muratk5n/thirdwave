case too, the niceties, formalities, rules had basis on actual power -
the military/econ power of the United States. It was US that provided
much of the military presence that allowed for the subsequent niceties
to exist, that we so quickly accuse Russia of breaking today.  But the
power structure is changing; RU was not happy with the status quo, its
warnings were ignored, so it started the latest engagement. And even
though support for Ukraine sounds "unwavering" today they are not
admitted to NATO, no rich country officially committed troops to the

<p>Nature: "Over the past generation, scientific publishing has become a
monoculture. Every scientist now seeks to publish their work in a
peer-reviewed journal and journals seek to increase their impact
factors. Publishing papers is now synonymous with seeking status.</p>
<p>Monocultures are vulnerable to viruses and prone to collapse, and that
is exactly what is happening to science. Taxpayers fund our work but
journals paywall it and reap the revenue. The costs of universal
prepublication peer review are extraordinary but the benefits are
dubious: reviewers miss most of the errors in papers and fail to catch
even the most brazen fraud. Many of the findings that pass peer review
do not replicate and most of them may in fact be false. The artificial
scarcity of opportunities to publish causes publication bias, which
distorts our sense of what is true and what is not. Unsurprisingly,
scientific progress seems to have stalled.</p>
<p>In our hearts, all of us know how we would pursue truth if we did not
have to pursue status as well. The only question is: are we brave
enough to do it?"</p>

not just films, games that causes the shooting phenomena I want to

<p>Miami Rice = Miami Vice</p>
<p>"Miami Rice Invades Haiti. In 1987, [new junta leader supported by US]
Namphy received IMF loans valued at $24.6 million in exchange for
agreeing to slash rice tariffs from 150% to 50%, the lowest in the
Caribbean. He opened all of Haiti’s ports to commercial activity and
agreed to stop what little support the government had offered Haitian
farmers. Meanwhile, Haiti’s military elite saw an opportunity to make
a profit smuggling American rice.. In the United States, the passage
of the 1985 Farm Bill significantly boosted subsidies to American rice
growers. By 1987, 40% of American rice growers' profits came from the
government. Heavily subsidized American rice could sell at prices far
below the market value of Haitian rice. Haitian farmers never stood a
chance against this unfair competition".. In Haiti, imported American
rice is called 'Miami rice' because it is shipped from Miami in sacks
stamped 'Miami, FLA.' By December 1987, Haiti’s rice production had
shrunk to 75% of Haitian needs"</p>

<p>.. Just been informed by my GP practice's pharmacist that there's now
a national shortage of Rybelsus, aka Semaglutide, my most effective
diabetes medication, that's likely to last into 2024. Influencers have
been boosting it as a weight loss drug (it's the same drug—in tablet
form—as Ozembic/Wegovy) and private clinics are buying up all the
stock for image-conscious idiots, depriving diabetics of access"</p>
