H2 View: "Korea sets up first blue hydrogen facility and signs 13
clean energy MOUs with US.. Korea.. seeks to develop stronger hydrogen
links... The agreements, which also covered hi-tech industrial areas,

"German Press Commends Moroccan Green Hydrogen Capabilities.. The
strategic partnership between Morocco and Germany brought them to sign
a joint declaration on the development of green hydrogen in 2020,
called Power-to-X, which aims to promote renewable energies...

According to Taggeschau, Morocco should become the leading producer of
green hydrogen in Africa by 2025, while the KfW German Development
Bank is financing the construction of a green hydrogen production
plant for an amount of 300 million euros"

The division in US might have had repercussions reaching all the way
to Asia Minor so-called Turkey; in gov some elements were pro-jihadi,
other elements wanted to keep out of Syria - the latter group could
have triggered, or were provoked into a coup attempt in 2016. This
Syria business did a number on everyone.

Per the Doran article and what we know about WH wanting better rels
with Iran/Syria/Russia 2008-16, it makes sense admin became divided
between supporting 'moderate rebels' and others who did not want to
knock out Assad. Joint Chiefs would later help Assad according to
Hersh, and some in that circle could've even been responsible for
taking Petreaus out of the picture. Someone dropped that oppo on him,
the affair w biographer, because they did not like what "his side" were
doing. They likely had backing from the WH, as taking out the chief of
CIA is no easy feat.

Wiki: "[2012/09/11] Petraeus resigns as Director of the CIA, after
admitting having a sexual relationship with his biographer"

---

Doran: "[In 2012] The director of the CIA, David Petraeus [.. created]
a plan to train and equip Syrian rebels in Jordan and to assist them
once back in Syria. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton.. all supported the Petraeus plan. But Obama rejected
it"

The Anglo, jihadis, against Russia ally Assad; the usual cast of
characters, present and accounted for.

Hersh, *The Killing of Osama bin Laden*: "The Obama administration has
never publicly admitted to its role in creating what the CIA calls a
'rat line,' a backchannel highway into Syria. The rat line, authorized
in early 2012, was used to funnel weapons and ammunition from Libya
via southern Turkey and across the Syrian border to the
opposition. Many of those in Syria who ultimately received the weapons
were jihadists, some of them affiliated with al-Qaida...

A highly classified.. report.. described a secret agreement reached in
early 2012 between [.. US, UK, Asia Minor, and some Gulf countries which]
was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafiâ€™s arsenals into Syria. A
number of front companies were set up in Libya, some under the cover
of Australian entities. Retired American soldiers, who didnâ€™t always
know who was really employing them, were hired to manage procurement
and shipping. The operation was run by David Petraeus, the CIA
director"

Ibew Local 11: "Coming Green Hydrogen Wave Set to Create Thousands of
New Union Jobs..  Local 11 has been well ahead of the clean-job curve,
making sure new, green hydrogen jobs will be filled by union members â€“
everything from fitting pipes and building fueling cells and fueling
stations to running electrolyzers and creating the physical hydrogen
transportation infrastructure"

I would not rely on the Fortran lang for anything new - would also aim
to replace existing code with newer languages.

This is how Western companies get to stay in Russia? Little naming
hocus pocus, little ownership change...

2013 NK's Un had his uncle Jang Song Thaek executed (by anti-aircraft
fire -yeah-), he was the most pro-China figure in NK gov. Un wants the
Americans as his neighbor, he has a pro-China figure executed, and
constant displays of weaponary is giving neighboring leaders an excuse
to invite more US presence to the region. Put the two and two and two
together, you get six.

LNG terminal project, secures $250m in fundraising round"

Clean fuel tech is a win for both new and existing energy
companies. Fossil companies can pivot to H2 and utilize their existing
know-how. Republicans have nothing to fear as oil, gas companies have
much to gain in this space. Trump started the H2@Scale program while
in office. Everyone from BP to Total are active in domain.

Haha

"@bps_artish@universeodon.com

.. as it's bin day, the bin wagon rolls around, and its new, and it's
powered by #hydrogen! And it's got big green stickers all over it and
it's in the South Derbyshire District Council livery.

So it's mine. I've paid for it through my rates and #SDDC have made
the kind of decisions I would make if I was sitting there deciding.

It's been a \#Labour council since 2021. I'll be exercising my
privilege to keep it that way on 4 May.

Local \#council \#elections matter. Don't waste your \#vote"

H2 Central: "Governor Ron DeSantis Signs MOU with LowCarbon Hydrogen

My focus is the FCEV and H2 production, the rest, I dont care. If
BEV support gets cut that is a good thing. Inferior technology.

I read the bill guts IRA. Not good.

Un didnt get what he wanted from Trump. He was asked to disarm, which
wld cause a reduction of US involvement in the region.

---

ðŸ˜‚ The sister gets in there delivers some punches.. But if we are to
believe Pompeo acct, NK really does not like China and beligerent
displays of weaponary helps increase US involvement in the region. It
is as if Un works for US' interests ðŸ¤”

TASS: "'Old man with no future': Kim Jong-unâ€™s sister hits back at US
