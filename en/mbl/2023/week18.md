Forbes: "In Europe and the U.S., the green hydrogen boom is exploding...

‚Ä¢ In January 2023, a Norwegian company announced a $4.3 billion
  investment in a steel plant with an integrated hydrogen production
  facility.

‚Ä¢ Construction of Finland‚Äôs first green hydrogen plant also began
  early this year, backed by a $76 million private investment.

‚Ä¢ In Spain, a Madrid-based company is developing the first green
  hydrogen supply chain between southern and northern Europe,
  anticipated to supply Northwest Europe with 6 million tons of green
  hydrogen by 2030.

‚Ä¢ In the U.S., the government is investing heavily in clear hydrogen
  initiatives. And the states are getting into the act, too. New York,
  for instance, has entered into an agreement with nearby states and
  40 hydrogen ecosystem partners to develop a regional hydrogen hub to
  accelerate green hydrogen energy innovation and investments"

Michio Kaku: "The James Webb Telescope is upsetting the apple
cart. All of a sudden we realize that we may have to rewrite all of
the textbooks about the beginning of the universe. It takes many
billions of years to create a galaxy like the Milky Way galaxy with a
hundred billion stars many billions of years old, but the James Webb
Telescope has identified six galaxies that exist half a billion years
after the big bang that are up to 10 times bigger than the Milky Way
galaxy. That shouldn't have happened. There should not be primordial
galaxies that are bigger than the Milky Way galaxy that are only half
a billion years old. Something is wrong, we may have to revise our
theory of the creation of the universe"

Note the '78 Sadat comment about a possible dam - "we are not going to
wait to die of thirst in Egypt, we‚Äôll go to Ethiopia and die
there". Everyone from Mobarak to Morsi to now Sisi talked tough on
this project.

Sudan is intertwined into the story. They are now against GERD, if
Egypt is planning something they would like to deal with Sudan's
official military for it IMO not RSF.

GERD construction was announced two months after Mobarak resignation
and a month before South Sudan break-up.

This calls for a timeline.

Reddit User: "[Answering question 'Why is water see through?'] It's a
little bit backwards. Life needed to be able to see through water, so
it created eyes that could see the light that water was clear to.

That might need some explanation. All things are "clear" to some kinds
of light and "opaque" to other light. Like how an X ray can go right
through your skin and see your bones. It's that way for all light,
including visible light.

So there was always some wavelength of light that made water
"clear". And some of those wavelengths are the visible light spectrum.

So when life evolved in the ocean, and eyes developed, it was very
useful to be able to see the light that could pass through the
water. And so you get eyes that can see in the ocean"

Washington Post: "The underbelly of [battery] electric
vehicles.. [their] production can exact a significant human and
environmental cost. To run, EVs require six times the mineral input,
by weight, of conventional vehicles..

These minerals, including cobalt, nickel, lithium and manganese, are
finite resources. And mining and processing them can be harmful for
workers, their communities and the local environment...

[U]nderneath the floor of your car is an approximately 900-pound
battery block containing materials that have been mined from the
ground, sent around the world and put through complex chemical
processing to fuel your ride from point A to point B. That supply
chain has a significant human and environmental toll"

H2 Fuel News: "Cummins Inc. has announced plans to invest over $1

including hydrogen, with the aim of decarbonizing truck and bus fleets
in the US. The company announced that this investment is on top of
those recently made in its Minnesota plant"

I studied Hinton's, Bengio's Le Cun's work, as it pertains to the
science of intelligence there is nothing there. It's time to bring
back the AI Winter - in fact Hinton seems to be calling for it,
subconciously wanting to be "put out of his misery".

---

He is not the Godfather of AI, he is one of the three people who
brought back the neural net approach to weak AI (ending the so-called
AI Winter which also was about neural nets). The "conspirators" made
NNs "deep" hence the monikor deep neural networks which helped further
their parrot capabilities. That's it. The tech is as parroty as it
was, but now, it can generate better spam. It still can't drive a car
or summarize a text. And it won't get there as long as maintream
remains on this misguided path. They will try bigger "better" neural
nets that will go nowhere just like some physicists want to keep
building bigger and better colliders instead of going back to the
drawing board and fixing their science.

The division in US might have had repercussions reaching all the way
to Asia Minor so-called Turkey; in gov some elements were pro-jihadi,
other elements wanted to keep out of Syria - the latter group could

Syria business did a number on everyone.

Per the Doran article and what we know about WH wanting better rels
with Iran/Syria/Russia 2008-16, it makes sense admin became divided
between supporting 'moderate rebels' and others who did not want to
knock out Assad. Joint Chiefs would later help Assad according to
Hersh, and some in that circle could've even been responsible for
taking Petreaus out of the picture. Someone dropped that oppo on him,
the affair w biographer, because they did not like what "his side" were
doing. They likely had backing from the WH, as taking out the chief of
CIA is no easy feat.

Doran: "[In 2012] The director of the CIA, David Petraeus [.. created]
a plan to train and equip Syrian rebels in Jordan and to assist them
once back in Syria. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton.. all supported the Petraeus plan. But Obama rejected
it"

The Anglo, jihadis, against Russia ally Assad; the usual cast of

Hersh, *The Killing of Osama bin Laden*: "The Obama administration has
never publicly admitted to its role in creating what the CIA calls a
'rat line,' a backchannel highway into Syria. The rat line, authorized
in early 2012, was used to funnel weapons and ammunition from Libya
via southern Turkey and across the Syrian border to the
opposition. Many of those in Syria who ultimately received the weapons
were jihadists, some of them affiliated with al-Qaida...

A highly classified.. report.. described a secret agreement reached in
early 2012 between [.. US, UK, Asia Minor, and some Gulf countries which]
was responsible for getting arms from Gaddafi‚Äôs arsenals into Syria. A
number of front companies were set up in Libya, some under the cover
of Australian entities. Retired American soldiers, who didn‚Äôt always
know who was really employing them, were hired to manage procurement
and shipping. The operation was run by David Petraeus, the CIA
director"

2013 NK's Un had his uncle Jang Song Thaek executed (by anti-aircraft

Americans as his neighbor, he has a pro-China figure executed, and
constant displays of weaponary is giving neighboring leaders an excuse
to invite more US presence to the region. Put the two and two and two
together, you get six.
