H2 View: "Ohmium to provide 52 tonnes of green hydrogen for Spanish
LNG terminal project, secures $250m in fundraising round"

Clean fuel tech is a win for both new and existing energy
companies. Fossil companies can pivot to H2 and utilize their existing
know-how. Republicans have nothing to fear as oil, gas companies have
much to gain in this space. Trump started the H2@Scale program while
in office. Everyone from BP to Total are active in domain.

.. as it's bin day, the bin wagon rolls around, and its new, and it's
powered by #hydrogen! And it's got big green stickers all over it and
it's in the South Derbyshire District Council livery.

So it's mine. I've paid for it through my rates and #SDDC have made
the kind of decisions I would make if I was sitting there deciding.

It's been a \#Labour council since 2021. I'll be exercising my
privilege to keep it that way on 4 May.

Local \#council \#elections matter. Don't waste your \#vote"

H2 Central: "Governor Ron DeSantis Signs MOU with LowCarbon Hydrogen
Corporation in South Korea, Company Set to Break Ground on Clean
Hydrogen Facility in Florida"

---

My focus is the FCEV and H2 production, the rest, I dont care. If
BEV support gets cut that is a good thing. Inferior technology.

---

I read the bill guts IRA. Not good.

only plan in Washington for avoiding a default"

Un didnt get what he wanted from Trump. He was asked to disarm, which
wld cause a reduction of US involvement in the region.

---

ðŸ˜‚ The sister gets in there delivers some punches.. But if we are to
believe Pompeo acct, NK really does not like China and beligerent
displays of weaponary helps increase US involvement in the region. It
is as if Un works for US' interests ðŸ¤”
