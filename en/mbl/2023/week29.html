<p>H2 Central: "The global market for ammonia is poised to triple in the

ammonia, a new analysis by S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights
says.. Decarbonization policies, including incentives in the
U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment
Mechanism, are transforming the economic fundamentals of low-carbon
ammonia.</p>
<p>The.. report says that the potential use of low-carbon ammonia as a
marine bunker fuel, industry feedstock and as a carrier for hydrogen
used in power generation represents a profound shift for the
industry—from one geared primarily towards fertilizer production to
one driven by energy markets.</p>

flexibility and customization possibilities than the ARM and x86 ISAs,
and it requires no license fees. The open-source ISA, which started in
2010 as part of the Parallel Computing Laboratory (Par Lab) at the
University of California, Berkeley, is now being used in more than 10
billion CPU cores in the market and continues on an aggressive growth
path..</p>

<p>RISC-V is set to follow the same path as Linux, whose development
community has made contributions over the years that have expanded the
open-source operating system’s functionality and market. Similarly,
developers in the RISC-V ecosystem are working together to create ISA

<p>Anil Dash: "There's an extraordinary amount of hype around 'AI' right
now, perhaps even greater than in past cycles, where we've seen an AI
bubble about once per decade. This time, the focus is on generative
systems, particularly LLMs and other tools designed to generate
plausible outputs that either make people feel like the response is
correct, or where the response is sufficient to fill in for domains
where correctness doesn't matter...</p>
<p>Amongst engineers, coders, technical architects, and product
designers, one of the most important traits that a system can have is
that one can reason about that system in a consistent and predictable
way. Even 'garbage in, garbage out' is an articulation of this
principle..</p>
<p>Today's highly-hyped generative AI systems (most famously OpenAI) are
designed to generate bullshit by design. To be clear, bullshit can
sometimes be useful, and even accidentally correct, but that doesn't
keep it from being bullshit. Worse, these systems are not meant to
generate consistent bullshit — you can get different bullshit answers
from the same prompts. You can put garbage in and get... bullshit out,
but the same quality bullshit that you get from non-garbage inputs!
And enthusiasts are current mistaking the fact that the bullshit is
consistently wrapped in the same envelope as meaning that the bullshit
inside is consistent, laundering the unreasonable-ness into appearing
reasonable"</p>

because there are multiple streamers, but it’s a group of giants

writers, directors, executives, and shareholders all realize streaming
is an awful business. Netflix and Disney have massively raised prices

there is no way to get new creative content into the market. Hollywood

internationally by the UN General Assembly Resolution 194 of 1948.
This rejection refuses to allow the Palestinian citizens of

no connection to the land, is a model of undemocratic practice"</p>

<p>"In the 1950s scientists developed the process for making
high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS). They first refined corn into starch,
then converted the starch into glucose, and finally converted the
glucose into fructose by adding enzymes. The resulting sweetener could
be purified to 90 percent fructose, a product that is much sweeter
than glucose or sucrose (common table sugar). Cane sugar was cheap in
the 1950s, and refining HFCS was an expensive process, so the new
sweetener did not get much attention. But in 1973 the Farm Bill
introduced subsidies for growing certain crops—direct payments to
farmers based on target prices set by the government. Under this
system, the government gave farmers “deficiency payments” to ensure
that target prices were met. In the case of corn, farmers could grow
as much as they wanted, sell it at any price, and still make a profit,
thanks to government subsidies. This encouraged a boom in corn
production, lowering its price on the open market, which made HFCS
financially viable"</p>
<hr />
<p>Perlmutter: "Fructose is.. glucose’s evil twin.. Starting around 1970,

insurance. Today, it's 90%. That's not nothing! 5% of the US is more
