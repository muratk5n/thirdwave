<p>Any software company can be split, and not vertically (along different
competencies) either. They can be split horizontally, cutting across
all of its services. Any service can be split. Mastodon proved even a
social network, which people thought had to be owned by one
organization (uh, like due to 'network effect' or something) could be
split across many servers combined by a light protocol. What else can
be seperated this way? How about digital ad monopolies? </p>

<p>Let's say a mechanism to compute the area of a circle (given its
radius) is needed. Do we throw bunch of "data" of radius/area pairs to
a parrot learner and hope it spits back something approaching real
answer?  No.</p>
<p>Here is what you do; mentally take out a piece of the circle,</p>
<p><a href="infp1.jpg">Figure 1</a></p>
<p>.. and other pieces like that, flip every other one place them side by
side</p>
<p><a href="infp2.jpg">Figure 2</a></p>
<p>Again, mental exercise, we think 'if I made the pieces smaller does
that <em>approach</em> a known calculation?' Yes it does,</p>
<p><a href="infp3.jpg">Figure 3</a></p>
<p>It approaches the area of a rectangle. We already know how to compute
that, height times width, $C/2 r$, $C$ is circumference, $C = 2 \pi
r$, area is $\pi r^2$. Boom.</p>
<p>We just used mental transformations (in complex problems the algebra
is more complex but still symbolic) to reach something simpler. That
final formula is the end-result, the fruit of science. The end-result
is fast to compute, and accurate. Simple manipulation w algebra,
geometry saved me from countless computations. This is how science is
done, through representations, mental transformations. </p>
<hr />
<p>Why is the neural net approach to AI is a big fat failure? They are
not following the proven method of science, even of pre-modern
science.. From get-go they compute stuff, and compute blindly. Science
uses representations, transformation, mental shortcuts so you <em>don't</em>
have to compute shit all the time. Practitioners of faux AI have it
backwards. </p>

<p>More resources, more munee</p>
<p>Peoples Dispatch: "[2022/12] US interference in the DR Congo has been
apparent since its independence, Musavuli added—in the assassination
of Patrice Lumumba, support given to the brutal regime of Mobuto Sese
Seko, the invasions of the 1990s and the subsequent peace talks, and
changes to the country’s constitution in 2006 to allow Joseph Kabila
to contest the election. 'In 2011, the US was one of the first
countries to recognize the results of the rigged elections..' Musavuli
said.</p>
<p>Three months later, the M23 uprising began. 'It is the same rebel
force over twenty years, with the same soldiers and the same
commanders, to serve the interests of Rwanda, which itself is a strong
US ally in the so-called War on Terror. And what are Rwanda’s
interests in the Congo- its land and its resources,' he added.</p>
<p>As such, 'the conflict in the DRC must not be seen as fighting between
a rebel group and the Congolese government.' This was reiterated by
activist and writer Claude Gatebuke, 'This is not an ordinary
rebellion. It is an invasion of the Congo by Rwanda and Uganda'"</p>

<p>All that cobalt, lithium is needed so you can enjoy your crooked
battery electric car not working over winter, after floods, and watch

<hr />
<p>Researcher Kambale Musavuli: "[In Congo the killing civilians by
groups such as M23] is a tactic of displacement. Whenever you are
massacring civilians in public.. those things are to terrorize the
population. When it happens in your community tomorrow you are not
going to be in the same area because you are afraid. We have mass
displacement over [about] five million internally displaced
Congolose..  [and right after ppl leave a place] you see development
of mining concessions in that same area. Not only that, there is the
dispossession of land" #AlJazeera</p>

<p>I guarantee it during the short-lived bizarre attempt, centers of
responsibility in the West were shitting in their pants... 'Whats
gonna happen? What if someone crazy gets hold of the nukes? (they
already know Putin isn't)'. Nothing was going to happen, political
adversaries routinely get poisoned in Russia, they would have nuked
this stupid son of a bitch... But still the events gave people
scare. It all goes to prove the more this needless war lasts, the more
pain everyone will suffer. The people who triggered the non-sense need
to understand, this ain't like 2013 stirring little shit up in Ukraine
can "change" some stuff... It already changed for the worse thanks to
you. This clusterfuck is your fault. Time for a fix?</p>

<p><em>War Dogs</em> has some psyop in it.. Its main characters were small
contractors for the US military, the movie essentially said "see even

thinking "mil is probably better off with the big defense
contractors". Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>But weapons makers were far from the only beneficiaries. Companies
benefiting from the buildup of the past 20 years range from weapons
manufacturers like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin, to logistics and
reconstruction firms like Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR) and Bechtel,
to armed private security contractors like Blackwater and Dyncorp. As
noted by Heidi Peltier in her analysis of the “camo economy,” roughly
half of the Pentagon budget—$370 billion in 2019 — went to military
contractors, for both war-related and ongoing peacetime activities"</p>
