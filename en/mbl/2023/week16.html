a simple Bedouin man who grew up on the sidelines of Sudan and did not
get anything from my country except violence". Life probably wasn't
too easy for him and his people... Generally though having two armies
neither of which feels too attached to civilian rule is not good. It's

<p>Michael Doran: "When [Obama] arrived in Washington in 2006, he
absorbed a set of ideas that had incubated on Capitol Hill during the
previous three years—ideas that had received widespread attention
thanks to the final report of the Iraq Study Group, a bipartisan
congressional commission whose co-chairs, former secretary of state
James Baker and former Indiana congressman Lee Hamilton, interpreted
their mission broadly, offering advice on all key aspects of Middle
East policy.. The report, published in December 2006, urged
then-President Bush to take four major steps: withdraw American troops
from Iraq; surge American troops in Afghanistan; reinvigorate the
Arab-Israeli 'peace process'; and, last but far from least, launch a
diplomatic engagement of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its junior
partner, the Assad regime in Syria. Baker and Hamilton believed that
Bush stood in thrall to Israel and was therefore insufficiently alive
to the benefits of cooperating with Iran and Syria. Those two regimes,
supposedly, shared with Washington the twin goals of stabilizing Iraq
and defeating al-Qaeda and other Sunni jihadi groups. In turn, this
shared interest would provide a foundation for building a concert
system of states—a club of stable powers that could work together to
contain the worst pathologies of the Middle East and lead the way to a
sunnier future.</p>
<p>Expressing the ethos of an influential segment of the foreign-policy
elite, the Baker-Hamilton report became the blueprint for the foreign
policy of the Obama administration, and its spirit continues to
pervade Obama’s inner circle. Denis McDonough, now the president’s
chief of staff, once worked as an aide to Lee Hamilton; so did
Benjamin Rhodes, who helped write the Iraq Study Group’s report. Obama
not only adopted the blueprint but took it one step further,
recruiting Vladimir Putin’s Russia as another candidate for membership
in the new club. The administration’s early 'reset' with Russia and
its policy of reaching out to Iran and Syria formed two parts of a
single vision"</p>

<p>They went behind Bama's back to give Assad intel on the opposition?
Quite a claim. </p>
<p>Hersh, <em>The Killing of Osama bin Laden</em>: "The administration’s policy
was contradictory. They wanted Assad to go but the opposition was
dominated by extremists. So who was going to replace him?  To say
Assad’s got to go is fine, but if you follow that through—therefore
anyone is better. It’s the ‘anybody else is better’ issue that the JCS
had with Obama’s policy... The Joint Chiefs felt that a direct
challenge to Obama’s policy would have 'had a zero chance of success.'
So in the autumn of 2013 they decided to take steps against the
extremists without going through political channels, by providing US
intelligence to the militaries of other nations, on the understanding
that it would be passed on to the Syrian army and used against the
common enemy, Jabhat al-Nusra and Islamic State... 'Obama didn’t know,
but Obama doesn’t know what the JCS does in every circumstance, and
that’s true of all presidents' [an official said].</p>
