<p>CCJ: "Hitting the market in 2025, the recently announced Kenworth T680
FCEV is the culmination of seven years that Kenworth has been
collaborating with Toyota on prototype vehicles. It combines Toyota's
second generation hydrogen fuel cell stack with the T680 Next Gen. The
T680 FCEV is a Class 8 tractor rated up to 82,000 pounds and stores 60
kilograms of hydrogen on board that powers a 310 kilowatt motor and
it's 415 horsepower gives you all the power you need to do your
regional or long haul driving. The range is 450 miles and can refuel
it in 20 to 30 minutes.</p>

<p>South of the US border when governments wanted to fight drug cartels,
they probably picked off the largest visible players, trying to end

want competition, a lively market, "better prices", "satisfied
customers" - you want an oligarchy, preferably a monopoly in the drug
business. Government then could reach a modus vivendi with that
player, one cartel supplies the much demanded product (no way around
that), hopefully keeping the price high, small fish do not fight
eachother for access, drug related crimes reduce.</p>

a problem that large sections of the population don’t want to

harms people in, or in need of, rental housing; roughly one-third of
the country’s households... Even 2020... was a good year for the
industry. Banks and other mortgage providers create money, lend it,
and charge interest on it. If that wasn’t already a sweet deal, the
federal government assumes a share of the risk of these mortgages..</p>
<p>A housing system that serves all but one group is not in a state of
crisis; it is one based on structural inequality and economic
exploitation... Why, then, are 'housing crisis' and 'supply-side'
arguments so prevalent?.. If we believe lack of supply is the cause of
lack of housing affordability, the solution is building
more... The.. argument serves a clear purpose: to sweeten the deal for
developers and landlords... </p>

arrives at an optimal balance. The most important is that land, on
which housing is built, is a fixed resource. We cannot produce more of

<p>A certain lightweight web framework supports functional programming,
as opposed to OOP. Back in the day OO was the shit, ppl thought
everything one day would be coded that way. FP changed the game, or

function centric, user's custom web functions are marked with
<code>@app.route</code> web calls are routed to them.</p>
