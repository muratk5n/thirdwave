A key founder of a TR nationalist party was of Jewish ancestry, born
in Greece, converted to Islam and considered Turk. This is the "Young
Turks" the Western media publicized back then (yes same ppl who were
the perpetrators of much crime later on - 'allegedly').

---

Religion-Nationality is hiding deep categorization errors. Past
milenia saw many peoples around Asia Minor converting to Islam
including original Turks.. But 1920s TR nation recategorized all
Muslims as Turks. So then.. not everyone is a real Turk, is it, as in
from Central Asia riding a donkey arriving to Anatolia "bringing
civilization" there (basically Greek music, Greek food, Mediterrenian
customs, "brought culture" wink wink). 10% of Asiatic genes says it
all - the *latest* official identity of Asia Minor is patently false.

---

Notice how religion was used as national identity. Not many realize
but the 20s Turkification also took religion as the basis (but then
deemphasized the religion itself, later reemphasized after 80s
-confused yet?-).

"[T]he 1923 Treaty of Lausanne was drawn up in the peace
settlement.. both Greece and Turkey agreed to a mutual exchange of
populations, irrespective of those populations' wishes.  Greece
expelled approximately 600,000... while [TR..]  expelled about 750,000
Anatolian Greeks... (some were allowed to stay in Istanbul).  These
figures differ, depending on the source. In deciding ethnicity, the
criterion used was religion. A Turkish-speaking Orthodox Christian in
Turkey was thus considered Greek, and expelled to Greece, while a
Greek-speaking Muslim who knew no Turkish was considered Turkish and
expelled to Turkey"

If minority culture does not even last [one generation](../../0119/2014/06/the-culture-code.html#heritage),
how could it last for millenia, across continents, varied host cultures?
That is the claim of the so-called Turks.

Break-even point for Avatar 2 was 1.4 billion.. What was the budget?
ðŸ¤” Can reverse engineer it from profit estimation; Profit P, Gross G,
Budget B, Marketing M, $ P = G - (B + M + 0.4 \cdot G) $ breakeven
means the $P=0$, marketing half the budget as before, $ 0 = G - (B +
\frac{B}{2} + 0.4 G)$ rearrange $0.4 G = B$, G=1400, then budget could
be ~560 million.

But the intent to repeal created deeper inter-party ideological
divisions on an economic issue, created less overall
unity.. great. One side is for the rich, the other side is, hopefully,

vaginas, or an ass crack.

Bloomberg: "How Changing Diets Leave Us Exposed to War, Extreme
Weather and Market Turbulence.. The convergence of global diets means
just three crops provide 50% of the worldâ€™s calories... A combination
of rising incomes, the impact of Western culture and industrial
farming focused on specific crops means we are all eating increasingly
alike. And that means more of us than ever depend on imported
food. Wheat, now an integral part of most diets, is produced
predominantly by just a handful of countries. When Russiaâ€™s invasion
of Ukraine disrupted trade, global prices spiked almost 40%...Of the
6,000 plant species humans have eaten over time, the world now mostly
eats nine, of which just three â€” rice, wheat and maize â€” provide 50%
of all calories"

Self-propelled howitzers and tank difference? On the surface they
might look similar but SPH is basically artillery on wheels. Tank
physically moves in an active battlefield heavily armored, heavily
armed, and ready for direct fire. SPH isn't as heavily armored as
tank, but can carry out indirect fire missions on targets that are not
in direct sight.

The clapping for Karzai photo shared previously was not a dig in admin
for quitting on an ally. It was about US invading and staying giving
ppl false hope against entrenched forces, and not helping a country
properly when they could.

*War Machine* paints the screw up that was the US involvement in AFG
well. The McMahon-Karzai scene; the general is just another US
official meddling.. US did not help the country, institutionally was
not capable. Another scene, general asks someone about growing an
alternate crop to poppy seed, the response was cotton is suitable, but
Congress will not let USAID help grow a product that will compete with
US farmers.

I searched for that exact quote in *The Operators*, movie's source
material, not there, but there is the story around few brave officials
[in this book](../../2023/01/little-america-chandrasekaran.html#cotton) who
tried to push cotton to supplant poppy in Afghanistan, and failing
thanks to USAID torpedoing the idea.

"According to IRS rules, if a Roth IRA account holder engages in a
prohibited transactionâ€”like using the money to invest in a company you
