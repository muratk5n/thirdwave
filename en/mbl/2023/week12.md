Brzezinski as in Mika Brzezinski, yes, his daughter - who Trump called
"was bleeding from the facelift" during 2016 campaign. She is married
to "Psycho Joe" (also per Trump) Scarborough, they have a little
shitlib talk show on MSDNC. Both are of course ardent supporters of
endless war in Ukraine until the last Ukranian dies.  Mika's dad
would've been proud.

Carter is one tough son of a bitch.. he is still alive isn't he
(medically at least)?  Sturdy mother.

A quick glance at a Zybybgybdy Brzezinski book reveals three words
that are obviously key for US policymakers - Eurasia, Eurasia,
Eurasia. ZB is the architect of US help to Afghan mujaheddin against
the Soviets during the 80s, and was the NatSec advisor to Carter.

This is no longer the Digital Age or even the Information Age.

This is the Bullshit Age"

Can't be mum on people that are on one side, always complain about
leaders on the other side. If institutions of the "Rules-Based Order"
are seen as taking sides, not being impartial, they'll become
irrelevant.

Maybe another reason US estab doesn't like Medicare-for-All is it
would hamper military recruitment for their endless wars. Who would
sign up for the military as a grunt if everyone had enough money to
live on and a proper health insurance?

On another video he says "I joined the military because I was poor".
Military gives you a salary, food, shelter, healthcare (it puts u in
situations that might be bad for health but anyway), why wouldn't he
join?

H2 storage in carbon nanotubes

[[-]](../../2022/02/h2-carbon-nanotubes.html)

---

Energy & Sustainable World: "[T]here are innovations on the horizon
that will make large-scale production of hydrogen much more
feasible. One such innovation is called Nanotubes. These tiny tubes
can store large amounts of hydrogen gas at room temperature...

Another innovation involves attaching some nanoparticles (i.e., tiny
particles) to some plastics; this makes them hydrophobic, which means
they won't absorb any water or moisture. When these hydrophobic
plastics are in contact with water, they release their stored hydrogen
gas (H2) and then change back into their hydrophilic state"

The stock market is still overvalued, Wilshire above 190. Levels of
around 100 would be normal. High FED rates can help get there. Same
for housing prices. Housing is a huge part of CPI and PCE.
