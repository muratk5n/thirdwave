"Hydrofuel.. has now entered into an exclusive manufacturing and sales

Adani Groups's fundamentals are strong. My guess is the investors
behind Hind are "retarded ESG" types, pushing for bizarro green tech,
not the good kind, they are likely stuck with certain bad investments
and now using Hindenb to take out potential competitors.

---

There is something fishy about those guys.. Their Adani work looked
like a hit job with an ulterior motive.

"Marc Cohodes alleged that Hindenburg sources information from large
funds, serving as a front for their short trades"

---

Business Insider: "Marc Cohodes who famously predicted the collapse of
FTX and Silvergate Capital Corporation has more stocks to call
out.. The mainstream media is lazy and could be co-conspirators in the
Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX and Silvergate downfalls, the short seller
said"

*Gunfight at Rio Bravo* - a Western movie with a Russian guy as the
hero. Historicaly a Russki soldier, Ivan Turchin did exist, dude
emigrated to US and even fought in the Civil War. Lincoln made him a

place in Senegal between 2014 and 2017. Oil and gas reserves worth

"At par" is the key word, par is the original value of the asset when
it was bought, the market price is the latest price. At par SVB assets
were fine, in "mark to market" sense they were not. BTFP loans assume
original price, the loan still needs to paid back, but it's a way of
shifting around of risk.

FED: "[12/03] The additional funding will be made available through
the creation of a new Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP), offering loans
of up to one year in length to banks, savings associations, credit
unions, and other eligible depository institutions pledging
U.S. Treasuries, agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, and other
qualifying assets as collateral. These assets will be valued at par"

H2 Central: "Verde Hydrogen, a new US based Hydrogen Technology
company has announced that the VERDE-1000, a 5MW Single Stack
Containerized Hydrogen Production System has passed a 3rd party test
and certification to validate its best-in-class energy efficiency and

Focker's [best friend](ejagoffmaxwell2.jpg)'s family ran an

JL Haims: "One day I heard a rumor that [Peter Thiel] defended
apartheid (which was then still the law of the land in South Africa),
which I found morally repugnant.. I wanted to give Peter the benefit
of the doubt.. He said, with no facial affect, that apartheid was a
sound economic system working efficiently, and moral issues were
irrelevant"

"It’s curious to some that the bank run somehow started before SVB’s
public announcements on March 9. It’s almost as if a number of very
lucky folk knew a great deal about what was going on before Joe Public
did. And the same depositors who withdrew their funds had contractual
agreements, which required them to keep their deposits at the bank or
face severe penalties. Somehow, these depositors were so desperate to
yank their deposits that they willingly violated those agreements and
sustained the penalties. I am not sure what information these
depositors learned that caused them to act so hastily without regard
to their agreement and breach consequences. Call me cynical but I am
also guessing that a number of those in the know were probably selling
a boatload of SVB stock between February 28 and the evening of March 9."

The show had advanced AI but at that time that could be possible;
science would've moved beyond retarded neural nets by then (which is
the current fashion).

---

*Battlestar Galactica* was good scifi - it brought more realism to the
genre. It did away with "beam weapons", the ships were shooting
physical objects at eachother.. Ships were powered by a fuel,
something substantial, not "charged". The fuel, "tylium", had to be
mined (when they ran low attempting to get more was two-ep long
adventure).

A previous share on the movie *Cobra* made a paralel to the "Scorpion
Unit" of Memphis, to that special team, outsider, specialized cop
mentality, "the heroes who do what others cannot", so forth..
Not picking on Stallone or that particular work, others from that era
had similar movies, here's an Ahnuld one, tough guy [tearing it up](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1j6A1QsiCkng1TupKnVUaiFghrS1R8wmM),
there are drugged out people.. Very Reaganesque.

US pro wrestling resembles stunt work.. it's like bunch of stunt
actors wanting to be movie stars. The fighting is likely how stunt
actors fight except there are no camera tricks to gloss over the
make-play parts - punch that doesn't connect, fall that doesn't look
real.. Then wrestling is like theater form of Holywood movie action.

Docker software allows packaging of code that needs run together in a
neat package, all code, utilities, even the OS itself. From AWS: "
Similar to how a virtual machine virtualizes (removes the need to
directly manage) server hardware, containers virtualize the operating
system of a server"

OSS Programmer: "Docker is deleting Open Source organisations..
Yesterday, Docker sent an email to any Docker Hub user
who had created an "organisation", telling them their account will be
deleted including all images, if they do not upgrade to a paid team

makers, and now that they're turning over significant revenue, they
are only too ready to forget their roots"

Smitsonian Magazine: "[In Europe] Germany started testing the world’s
first hydrogen-powered passenger trains in 2018, going on to roll out
a fleet in 2022. The German Coradia iLint trains, also made by Alstom,
can reach speeds of 140 miles per hour. A single tank of hydrogen can
last for more that 600 miles. Germany’s trains are a 'model for the
rest of the world' and 'a milestone on the road to climate neutrality
in the transport sector,' said Stephan Weil, president of Lower
Saxony"

Smitsonian Magazine: "This summer, North America’s first zero-emission
train will start running in Canada. The hydrogen-powered Train de
Charlevoix will run a 90-minute route between ​​Parc de la
Chute-Montmorency, the site of an almost 300-foot waterfall located
just outside of Québec City"

PSG was bought in 2011 apparently when Qatar was feelin' good, on top
of the world, before it got bitchslapped back to its place, woke up to
reality started smelling coffee... Reality bites: you can't be a
leader with tiny-ass landmass, little population, and no symbolic
presence in the Islamic world to speak of (a "museum" designed by
I.M. Pei doesn't count).

---

Yo the French team was *on their ass*, even with all that dubious shit
they still could've taken the Cup.

---

Aah it makes even more sense now; Messi's pro team PSG is owned by
Qatar, that could be another reason why FIFA/Qatar cheated in the
final WC game to have Argentina win with Messi its captain.

Brzezinski as in Mika Brzezinski, yes, his daughter - who Trump called
"was bleeding from the facelift" during 2016 campaign. She is married
to "Psycho Joe" (also per Trump) Scarborough, they have a little
shitlib talk show on MSDNC. Both are of course ardent supporters of
endless war in Ukraine until the last Ukranian dies.  Mika's dad
would've been proud.

Carter is one tough son of a bitch.. he is still alive isn't he
(medically at least)?  Sturdy mother.

---

A quick glance at a Zybybgybdy Brzezinski book reveals three words
that are obviously key for US policymakers - Eurasia, Eurasia,
Eurasia. ZB is the architect of US help to Afghan mujaheddin against
the Soviets during the 80s, and was the NatSec advisor to Carter.

Energy & Sustainable World: "[T]here are innovations on the horizon
that will make large-scale production of hydrogen much more
feasible. One such innovation is called Nanotubes. These tiny tubes
can store large amounts of hydrogen gas at room temperature...

Another innovation involves attaching some nanoparticles (i.e., tiny
particles) to some plastics; this makes them hydrophobic, which means
they won't absorb any water or moisture. When these hydrophobic
plastics are in contact with water, they release their stored hydrogen
gas (H2) and then change back into their hydrophilic state"
