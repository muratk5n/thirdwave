That program would have to be funded of course with tax revenues which
likely is high enough for FN. But they have a wealth distr problem too,
not as bad as US, but getting worse. Assets hogged by top 10% will trigger
housing crisis.

If you grew up in the 1980s, you probably remember hearing about how
people in the Soviet Union couldn't buy necessities because of the
failures of central planning. It was used as proof capitalism was
superior to communism.

Welcome to the 2023 USA, where one drug company running behind central
production targets causes a shortage for everyone. Or where one food
plant having problems causes a baby formula shortage. The problem is a
lack of slack in the system--but slack is unprofitable"

Bad news for Ukranians but Russian army without the Wagner chief seems
to be fighting better than with him around. Guy was an "enterpreneur"
right, always marketing himself meaning unnecessarily talking out of
his ass that also broke discipline. Such acts do not work in high-risk
occupations like war. The free-market is fine for selling shoelaces
or candy and shit, but for anything more serious, the government has
to be involved.

The powers that be can try to criminalize it, but cannot criminalize
people simply *not* buying certain products.

BDS will work. Thats why they are scared of it.

Cannot deny what Houthis are doing is helpful for the Palestinian
cause.. they are hitting the muckers where it hurts, their money and
bidness. If the boycots expand as well together they can move the
dial.

F24: "World’s largest shipping firm Maersk suspends Red Sea traffic
after Houthi attacks.. A ballistic missile fired by Yemen's Houthi
rebels slammed into a cargo ship Friday in the Red Sea near the
strategic Bab el-Mandeb Strait, following another attack only hours
earlier that struck a separate vessel, authorities said"
