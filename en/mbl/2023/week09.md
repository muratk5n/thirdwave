All things considered, has the US been a "force for good" in the
world?

The report card is spotty. Just the other day I read about "Sam the
Banana Man" Zemurray, a US businessman, when his banana business was
threatened in Honduras, he personally organized a coup, created a
small civilian army put them on a ship sent them over to Honduras to
fight the government, contributed to the overthrow of a democratically
elected president (USG mostly stood by and in the end helped
him). That's not all, the newly installed president **paid him** for
the trouble using Honduras' taxpayer money. How is that for money well
spent?

"Each year, 119 billion pounds of food is wasted in the United
States. That equates to 130 billion meals and more than $408 billion
in food thrown away each year. Shockingly, nearly 40% of all food in
America is wasted"

"Can we produce enough food?" Much of the food production is currently
wasted.

Besides the GHG issue, farming takes up too much space and is likely
bad for the environment. A new system could discourage it all. Limit
ownership of land enough for shelter, non-farm production, the rest
becomes public land, only automated, vertical farming is encouraged,
meat production through lab-based methods.

While Biden was in Ukraine, Trump was in the disaster area in Ohio,
distributing food, listening to people. During the 1992 campaign the
slogan "America needs a president who cares as much about the 'Middle
West as the Middle East'" was a good seller; a variation of that can
be in effect for 2024.
