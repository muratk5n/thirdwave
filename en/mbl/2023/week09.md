"Each year, 119 billion pounds of food is wasted in the United
States. That equates to 130 billion meals and more than $408 billion

wasted.

becomes public land, only automated, vertical farming is encouraged,
meat production through lab-based methods.

Amendment freedom of the press and freedom of speech which most
countries don't have as a law.  [That clause] will be essentially
rescinded if Julian Assange is successfully prosecuted"

While Biden was in Ukraine, Trump was in the disaster area in Ohio,
distributing food, listening to people. During the 1992 campaign the
slogan "America needs a president who cares as much about the 'Middle
