Doctorow: "Tesla is having its own [Dieselgate scandal](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-batteries-range/).
A stunning investigation by Steve Stecklow and Norihiko Shirouzu for
Reuters reveals how Tesla was able to create its own demon-haunted
car, which systematically deceived drivers about its driving range,
and the increasingly desperate measures the company turned to as
customers discovered the ruse"

Zombie apocalypse art form seems mostly about a wish than a future
scare. Think about it, apoc. destroys modern life, no more traffic,
work, busy-busy pace.. People spread out into all corners of the
world, live closer to nature, less density. Zombies represent a
constant threat, kill-or-be-killed situation harks back to a
pre-agriculture hunter-gatherer state, when we had to protect against
predators. The world becomes more public, since the concept of most
private property would lose meaning.

If you have the power in the region, can stop shipments. Russia has
the power - have to negotiate with that. Some RU opponents are too
quick to use name-and-shame, procedure, rules of engagement, "rules
based order" arguments to dismiss opponent's position but, in their
case too, the niceties, formalities, rules had basis on actual power -
the military/econ power of the United States. It was US that provided
much of the military presence that allowed for the subsequent niceties
to exist, that we so quickly accuse Russia of breaking today.  But the
power structure is changing; RU was not happy with the status quo, its
warnings were ignored, so it started the latest engagement. And even
though support for Ukraine sounds "unwavering" today they are not
admitted to NATO, no rich country officially committed troops to the
teather, noone said "one for all all for one". The rest is
demagogueric bullshit.

Nature: "Over the past generation, scientific publishing has become a
monoculture. Every scientist now seeks to publish their work in a
peer-reviewed journal and journals seek to increase their impact
factors. Publishing papers is now synonymous with seeking status.

Monocultures are vulnerable to viruses and prone to collapse, and that
is exactly what is happening to science. Taxpayers fund our work but
journals paywall it and reap the revenue. The costs of universal
prepublication peer review are extraordinary but the benefits are
dubious: reviewers miss most of the errors in papers and fail to catch
even the most brazen fraud. Many of the findings that pass peer review
do not replicate and most of them may in fact be false. The artificial
scarcity of opportunities to publish causes publication bias, which
distorts our sense of what is true and what is not. Unsurprisingly,
scientific progress seems to have stalled.

In our hearts, all of us know how we would pursue truth if we did not
have to pursue status as well. The only question is: are we brave
enough to do it?"

Who's going to tell Mel Gibson?

"[2000, WaPo, There was an] ancient Catholic teaching that 'the Jews
killed Christ.' Since time immemorial, that accusation has been hauled
out as an excuse for discrimination, pogrom and Holocaust... In the
gospel story of Good Friday, Pontius Pilate is portrayed as a weak,
frightened leader. Poor powerless Pilate wants to set Jesus
free... It's a dramatic story. Biblical scholars say it probably
served a political purpose for the early Christians by steering blame
away from the Romans. But everything we know about the Roman
government of Judaea and about Pontius Pilate himself tells us that
this scenario is probably bunk"

Oliver Stone is a milquetoast critic, dabbles in conspiracies on JFK
implying gov had an hand in his death (untrue, JFK was an incompetent

like his movies, he is useful, so he is allowed to do what he
does. Maybe *Wall Street* could've made a difference, but Stone made
Gekko look cool - failed. Michael Douglas says he runs into finance
types all the time and they tell him "they loved that Gekko character
and want to be like him". GG was supposed to be the bad guy in that

The Matrix symbolizes government - it is "everywhere", defines the
rules, bureucratic, "opressive".  Then ragtag freedom fighters, rebel
simple humans, like early US adventerous settlers?, are idolized, when
they rebel with guns -the right loves that part- it is almost like an
mental orgasm for them, it is very cool. The cultural left is happy
too because it is, well, opressive government like in 1973, ew like
Nixon or something (who ended the Vietnam war but whatever).. It is
not just films, games that causes the shooting phenomena I want to
make that clear, the pro-market anti-gov ideology is everywhere (the
real Matrix?), which is funded, nurtured by private interests. This
ideology, on its fringes, will cause school shootings. Said interests
are squarely responsible for the deaths of those kids.

---

A public school is a government run institution, so gun violence there
is like a mini-attack against the government. Kids learn who the bad
guy is through their media, popular culture, or the political
discourse which seeps through to them through grown ups, some on the
extremes can apply it in real life. Parkland, Columbine were both
public high schools. The kids who did the shooting at Columbine maybe
were acting out the lobby scene from *The Matrix*.

The Economist: "[2011 A] sober view of globalisation deserves a wide
audience. But whether it will get it is another matter. This is partly
because 'World 3.0' is a much less exciting title than 'The World is
Flat' or 'Jihad vs. McWorld'. And it is partly because people seem to
have a natural tendency to overestimate the distance-destroying
quality of technology. Go back to the era of dictators and world wars
and you can find exactly the same addiction to globaloney. Henry Ford
said cars and planes were 'binding the world together'. Martin
Heidegger said that 'everything is equally far and equally
near'. George Orwell got so annoyed by all this that he wrote a
blistering attack on all the fashionable talk about the abolition of
distance and the disappearance of frontiers.. in 1944"

Hi, we're a tech startup run by libertarian Silicon Valley tech bros.

We're not a newspaper, we're a content portal.

We're not a taxi service, we're a ride sharing app.

We're not a pay TV service, we're a streaming platform.

We're not a department store, we're an e-commerce marketplace.

We're not a financial services firm, we're crypto.

We're not a space agency, we're a group of visionaries who are totally

We're not a copywriting and graphic design agency, we're a large

Oh sure, we compete against those established businesses. We basically
provide the same goods and services.

But we're totally not those things. At least from a legal and PR
standpoint.

And that means all the laws and regulations that have built up over
the decades around those industries don't apply to us.

Things like consumer protections, privacy protections, minimum wage
laws, local content requirements, safety regulations, environmental
protections... They totally don't apply to us.

Even copyright laws — as long as we're talking about everyone else's
intellectual property.

We're going to move fast and break things — and then externalise the
costs of the things we break.

We've also raised several billion in VC funding, and we'll sell our
products below cost — even give them away for free for a time — until
we run our competition out of the market.

Once we have a near monopoly, we'll enshitify the hell out of our
service and jack up prices.

You won't believe what you agreed to in our terms of service
agreement.

We may also be secretly hoarding your personal information. We know
who you are, we know where you work, we know where you live. But you
can trust us.

By the time the regulators and the general public catch on to what
we're doing, we will have well and truly moved on to our next grift.

People are in awe of some of the freedoms enjoyed by a US film writer,
director. How can you speak against the government, hell, even the
concept of government? That has nothing to do with the "strength of

structure in the country. Corporations won the war against all other
power centers in US, now through *their* movies they are rubbing
everyone else's noses in it. This is how heroes of a movie can enter a
government building with guns (lots of guns), shoot an innocent
employee (the guy wasn't overtaken by 'the Matrix' so he'd die in his

Miami Rice = Miami Vice

"Miami Rice Invades Haiti. In 1987, [new junta leader supported by US]
Namphy received IMF loans valued at $24.6 million in exchange for
agreeing to slash rice tariffs from 150% to 50%, the lowest in the
Caribbean. He opened all of Haiti’s ports to commercial activity and
agreed to stop what little support the government had offered Haitian
farmers. Meanwhile, Haiti’s military elite saw an opportunity to make
a profit smuggling American rice.. In the United States, the passage
of the 1985 Farm Bill significantly boosted subsidies to American rice
growers. By 1987, 40% of American rice growers' profits came from the
government. Heavily subsidized American rice could sell at prices far
below the market value of Haitian rice. Haitian farmers never stood a
chance against this unfair competition".. In Haiti, imported American
rice is called 'Miami rice' because it is shipped from Miami in sacks
stamped 'Miami, FLA.' By December 1987, Haiti’s rice production had
shrunk to 75% of Haitian needs"
