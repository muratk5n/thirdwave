sell bonds at a hurry had to sell sell them at a loss.</p>
<p>"One refrain we‚Äôve heard lately is that Silicon Valley Bank failed
because it took risks that turned sour. The specific kind of risk in
the limelight right now is what‚Äôs known in financial circles as
duration risk... The bank was flooded with deposits after the start of
the pandemic, and it invested a large chunk of them in long-term
government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which paid a higher
yield than short-term Treasuries. 'Had they invested in two years or
less, they would have taken a much smaller hit,' he said.. Worth
noting, SVB‚Äôs losses were only on paper ‚Äî that is, until the bank
needed to offload those bonds quickly as depositors rushed for the
exits"</p>

feeling good about himself.. Maybe there is another him out there in a
parallel world who is better off? Add little time travel future him
can time travel to his old (current) self and help him (creating "new
branches" in the MV too bro, but it's all good). So many
options... Intoxicating. Poor person does not know where to start.  I
guess with so many options his current sorry state is his fault, which
could be the main point of the exercise. Psyop.</p>

<p>NYT: "Inside the Global Race to Turn Water Into Fuel..</p>
<p>A consortium of energy companies led by BP plans to cover an expanse
of land eight times as large as New York City with as many as 1,743
wind turbines, each nearly as tall as the Empire State Building, along
with 10 million or so solar panels and more than a thousand miles of
access roads to connect them all. But none of the 26 gigawatts of
energy the site expects to produce, equivalent to a third of what
Australia‚Äôs grid currently requires, will go toward public
use. Instead, it will be used to manufacture a novel kind of
industrial fuel: green hydrogen. This patch of desert, more than 100
miles from the nearest town, sits next to the biggest problem that
green hydrogen could help solve: vast iron ore mines that are full of
machines powered by immense amounts of dirty fossil fuels. Three of
the world‚Äôs four biggest ore miners operate dozens of mines
here.Proponents hope green hydrogen will clean up not only mining but
other industries by replacing fossil fuel use in steel making,
shipping, cement and elsewhere..</p>
<p>Last year, government subsidies sped up action in the European Union,
India, Australia, the United States and elsewhere. The Inflation
Reduction Act, the Biden administration‚Äôs landmark climate
legislation, aims to drive the domestic cost of green hydrogen down to
a quarter of what it is now in less than a decade through tax
incentives and $9.5 billion in grants. 'We are about to jump from the
starting blocks,' said Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, who once led Germany‚Äôs
biggest renewable energy company and now runs BP‚Äôs gas and low-carbon
operations. 'I think hydrogen will grow even faster than wind and
solar have.'"</p>
