Under the name Mississippi Clean Hydrogen Hub (MCHH), the project
leverages Hy Storâ€™s underground salt formations for storing
hydrogen gas in bulk, produced only from renewable resources. Hydrogen
functions as an energy carrier, so the bulk storage angle would
effectively provide steel makers and other industrial users with

lab. The team had been exploring nickel as a catalytic replacement for

as quick and effective at breaking down water into hydrogen.</p>
<p>'Every day, I passed this same plant,' said Attarzadeh, a doctoral
student in environmental science and engineering. 'And I started
connecting it to our catalyst problem. What caught my attention was
how big the leaves and fruits were compared to other desert plants;
the prickly pear has an extraordinary surface area.'</p>
<p>That's when the Attarzadeh had an idea. What if they designed a 3D
nickel-based catalyst in the shape of the prickly pear cactus? The
larger surface area could accommodate more electrochemical
reactionsâ€”creating moreÂ hydrogenÂ than nickel typically can. The team
quickly designed the nano-scale structureâ€”invisible to the human
eyeâ€”and put it to the test. 'We tested the catalyst's ability to split
water repeatedly and had good results'"</p>
