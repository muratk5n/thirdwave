Phys.org: "New calcium material functions as an ammonia synthesis
catalyst.. Researchers find calcium outshines chromium in the
catalytic production of ammonia. Working together, a humble trio of
calcium atoms have defied expectations to break apart one of the
strongest chemical bonds known"

Weekend Reading: How survey-centric political reporting distracts and
distorts our understanding of American politics.. [On current
political reporting on polls, particularly around demographic
trends..W]hen it comes to specific demographic groups or subgroups,
the differences in partisanship we see from poll to poll are almost
entirely noise. By 'noise,' I mean the completely predictable static
that comes from pollingâ€™s inherent margins of error, as well as the
heavy weighting that is now standard given vanishingly low response
rates. This means that almost any time the media writes about
demographic trends in partisanship, itâ€™s not offering us important new
information; itâ€™s just narrating noise â€“ conflating inevitable
statistical and methodological variation with changes in votersâ€™
preferences. The mediaâ€™s amplification of this noise drowns out any
possibility of discussion or analysis that would help Americans
understand the actual dynamics of elections or the real stakes.

"The discount retailer [Walmart Chile] has opened a green hydrogen

partnership with generating company Engie... In its first stage, the
green hydrogen plant will allow the Quilicura distribution center to

energy cells, cutting 250 tons of toxic waste per year"

Nature: "LK-99 isnâ€™t a superconductor â€” how science sleuths solved the
mystery.. The conclusion dashes hopes that LK-99 â€” a compound of
copper, lead, phosphorus and oxygen â€” marked the discovery of the
first superconductor that works at room temperature and ambient
pressure. Instead, studies have shown that impurities in the material
â€” in particular, copper sulfide â€” were responsible for the sharp drops
in electrical resistivity and partial levitation over a magnet, which
looked similar to properties exhibited by superconductors"

The Guardian: "Scientists and academics say they have been warning for

'What triggered the fire', 'why was the response late' are almost

The Guardian: "Englandâ€™s water system: the last of the privatised
monopolies.. Selling Britainâ€™s state-owned water authorities seemed
like a good idea to Conservative ministers in the 1980s.. Why not let
the private sector inject some energy and much-needed cash into a
project that a tired public sector management was ill-equipped to
handle, they argued.

But since 1989, when 10 regional water authorities were sold, there
has been claim and counter claim about the benefits that can be
credited to the new private sector owners. To the industryâ€™s
detractors, one clear cost is the failure to upgrade a sewer system
that regularly overflows into watercourses, polluting rivers and
killing wildlife"

A theory goes since inflation has to do with circulation of money in
the economy among regular people, if mega corporations run the roost
all money would eventually end up in their coffers, out of the
circulation, so in essence they'd have an deflationary effect. See
Amazon's total assets,


```python
u.biz_balance("AMZN")['totalAssets'] / 1e9
```

```text

Fires, how they spread. Distance between homes is key, also house
regulation codes. Greenery between houses can help fires but more
deadly is the flammable leaves, needles they drop. With the right
wind, ever-present (and worsening) heat conditions, stuff catches fire
and spreads like, well, wildfire.

Doctorow: "*Bezzle (n): 'the magic interval when a confidence trickster

Uber was, is, and always will be a bezzle. There are just intrinsic
limitations to the profits available to operating a taxi fleet, even
if you can misclassify your employees as contractors and steal their
wages, even as you force them to bear the cost of buying and
maintaining your taxis.

The magic of early Uber â€“ when taxi rides were incredibly cheap, and
there were always cars available, and drivers made generous livings
behind the wheel â€“ wasn't magic at all. It was just predatory pricing"
