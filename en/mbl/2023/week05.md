# Week 5


According to Pompeo book Kim (NK) [said](https://www.arabnews.com/node/2238426/world) 
he needed the Americans in South Korea to protect him from the CCP,
and that the CCP needs the Americans out so they can turn NK into a
vassal state. Maybe Pomp is blowing smoke but interesting data
point anyway... We know so little of NK, CH-NK relation might be
rockier than previously thought.

"@spencerdailey@journa.host

If you had said 3 months ago that I'd be boosting posts about
decentralized protocol projects, I'd have channeled years of web3
skepticism into a categorical denial. But here we are in
blockchain-less Mastodon-land, which has totally rehabilitated the
brand of 'decentralized' and reminded us of the great successes of
email, internet, and torrent tech, and that we should want more"

BBC: "The race to make diesel engines run on hydrogen.. Engineers at
the University of New South Wales (UNSW) say they have successfully
modified a conventional diesel engine to use a mix of hydrogen and a
small amount of diesel, claiming their patented technology has cut
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by more than 85%. It's the work of
[researcher] and his team at the university's School of Mechanical and
Manufacturing Engineering. 'The interest in converting an existing
diesel engine into a clean-burning hydrogen engine is extremely high,'
[he] tells the BBC"

I've spent the last few months bringing my 23+ years of blog archives
up to date.. Tonight's fun discovery is Marc Andreessen affirmatively
citing my work as 'the smartest thing anyone has said' about the
inevitability of a federation of independent networks connected by an
open standard to win against Facebook and similar walled gardens. Six
months later in June 2008, he joined Facebook's board"

But employee compensation as part of corporate revenue is going
down. It's *been* going down since the 70s. Not good.

One merit point for the homie. The opposition is already talking to an
H2 expert, so now both major parties are involved with clean fuels.

H2 Insight: "Green hydrogen targets and incentives.. [TR] has unveiled
a new national Hydrogen Technology Strategy and Roadmap that contains
new targets for green H2 production, a plan to introduce an incentive
mechanism for the local production of equipment, and roles for blue
and turquoise H2 and hydrogen blending into the natural-gas grid"

"Scorpion Unit".. Apparently they roll up on people in unmarked cars,
yell and scream point guns on their heads etc. WTF? White police,
black police doesn't matter - the culture is key.

LA Times: "In early 2022, as violent crime rose in Memphis, Mayor Jim
Strickland set out his ideas for returning safety to the city.. At the
top of his plan: Increase funding to the Memphis Police Department,
give raises and bonuses to officers, and continue the usage of the
city’s newly formed 'SCORPION' unit, a specialized group of four
roving 10-person teams"
