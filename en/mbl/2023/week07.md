CNBC: "Amazon is the latest threat to Facebook as ad targeting
suffers.. Until a year ago, Amazon didn‚Äôt even disclose the size of
its advertising business, leaving analysts and investors to guess how
much the company was making in allowing sellers and brands to promote
their wares on the site and apps. Now, the company‚Äôs ad division is a
38 billion annual business, and last week reported 19% year-over-year
growth in the fourth quarter to $11.6 billion"

Chris Hedges: "Woke Imperialism.. The brutal murder of Tyre Nichols by
five Black Memphis, Tennessee, police officers should be enough to
implode the fantasy that identity politics and diversity will solve
the social, economic and political decay that besets the United
States. Not only are the former officers Black, but the city‚Äôs police
department is headed by Cerelyn Davis, a Black woman. None of this
helped Nichols, another victim of a modern-day police lynching.  ‚Äã

The militarists, corporatists, oligarchs, politicians, academics and
media conglomerates champion identity politics and diversity because
it does nothing to address the systemic injustices or the scourge of
permanent war that plague the U.S. It is an advertising gimmick, a
brand, used to mask mounting social inequality and imperial folly. It
busies liberals and the educated with a boutique activism, which is
not only ineffectual but exacerbates the divide between the privileged
and a working class in deep economic distress. The haves scold the
have-nots for their bad manners, racism, linguistic insensitivity and
garishness, while ignoring the root causes of their economic
distress. The oligarchs could not be happier...

If you stand with the oppressed, you will almost always end up being
treated like the oppressed. This is why the F.B.I., along with Chicago
police, murdered Fred Hampton and was almost certainly involved in the
murder of Malcolm X, who referred to impoverished urban neighborhoods
as 'internal colonies.'"

Paper: "[T]he high-temperature [solid-oxide direct-ammonia fuel-cell]

more suitable for the stationary energy system, instead of automotive
applications. Japan is a country intensively developing renewable
energy for its industrial and residential usage. Moreover the IHI, a
Japanese manufacturing firm, obtained 1-kW class power from a high
temperature DAFC, which could possibly replace those facilities using
natural gas in the future"

H2 Central: "The 1948 Chevrolet 3100 truck.. may look like a
traditional hot rod on the outside, but it hides something a bit
unconventional under the hood. While it draws juice from a
supercharged, 6.2-liter V8, the LS3 in question is not a
gas-guzzler. Instead of gulping gasoline to spin the wheels, the V8
unit feeds on hydrogen..

[Owner] says the hydrogen-powered V8 is capable of much more than
that. He will be able to demonstrate that once he gets his hands on a
set of bigger custom-made injectors.

Once installed, they will enable the V8 to deliver between 550 to 600
horsepower. All that with only water and steam coming out of the
exhaust pipe? Yup, it sounds like a great and efficient way to
keep¬†big-displacement V8 engines alive"

Raising the retirement age? It needs to be lowered, as in down to 18. 
Noone should work bcz they have to. There is plenty of f-ing money -
govs will find it when they have to. They happily sink over a trillion
into a lackluster fighter plane, they surely can find some of
it for regular people.

That's like saying you can free yourself from the burdens of life by

Borne: ‚ÄúHelping everyone to free themselves through work is a value of

Borne is supposedly "leftist" but sadly now turned into window
dressing for anti-left policies... The NYT piece is probably psyop
designed to generate symphathy for her so we forget about the recent
protests against the goverment trying to raise the retirement age..

It's not possible to be culturally Catholic in a Protestan majority
country and vica versa. Your codes will not allow it. If you try too
hard to be something else, you will become neurotic. This word is
associated with certain subgroup but there is Italian neuroticism too,
in quotes obviously "Italian" - same for Polish, and others. First
generation children and their descendants need to understand this
clearly - that fureign fuck talking shit with an accent (your elders)
is not similar to you. It's sad, but that is the truth.

---

Culture is transmitted at young age, subconciously, via osmosis -
through a land and its people, one on one, not through education,
stories, belief, or self-declaration.

---

All migrants are assimilated in one generation; the Turks in Anatolia
were no exception. Their initial culture is gone - almost nothing of
it remains. A form of language is around due to adminstrative,
military reasons, but that language is changed beyond recognition to
the extent that Anatolians today cannot understand "their cousins" in
Asia.
