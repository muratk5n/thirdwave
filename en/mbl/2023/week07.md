NL company - apparently they can do this at scale? Supercritical water
gasification - something to look out for.

SCW Systems: "[W]e also know water as a gas in the form of steam and
as a solid in the form of ice. But there is also a fourth state of
water: the supercritical state. Under extreme conditions (very high
pressure and temperature) water acquires very special properties. This
is the core of this technology.

If we mix water with organic wastes and bring it into the
supercritical state, something special happens. All organic matter in
the water, both recently formed organic matter and fossil-based,
breaks down into gases we can put to good use: methane and hydrogen"

This might actually be the paper that initiated the word 'stochastic parrot' 
\#ChatGPT \#DeepShit

"On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots.. [One] category of risk
involves bad actors taking advantage of the ability of large
[neural-net based language models -LM-]s to produce large quantities
of seemingly coherent texts on specific topics on demand in cases
where those deploying the LM have no investment in the truth of the
generated text. These include prosaic cases, such as services set up
to ‘automatically’ write term papers or interact on social media..

Yet another risk connected to seeming coherence and fluency involves
machine translation (MT) and the way that increased fluency of MT
output changes the perceived adequacy of that output.  This differs
somewhat from the cases above in that there was an initial human
communicative intent, by the author of the source language
text. However, MT systems can (and frequently do) produce output that
is inaccurate yet both fluent and (again, seemingly) coherent in its
own right to a consumer who either doesn’t see the source text or
cannot understand the source text on their own"

People will still work for extra pay. But in terms of the essentials,
we need to remember currently less than 2% of US labor is sufficient
to produce food - this is the percentage of labor in farming. That
means the labor of 98% is already not necessary for the most essential
item - sustenance.

Guy signed up right after 9/11 in that gung-ho atmosphere, deployed to
Afghanistan; But called the Iraqi invasion illegal, and was killed
afterwards?  Actually from a just war viewpoint, AFG was the place
9/11 originated, so attacking it at least initially may not
be.. unjust. I had not heard about the PT Iraqi crit, that's good, the
guy wasn't some blind overzealous nationalist dipshit. He was probably
killed for it, by the deep state, sorry "friendly fire" 🤔.

Chris Hedges: "Woke Imperialism.. The brutal murder of Tyre Nichols by
five Black Memphis, Tennessee, police officers should be enough to
implode the fantasy that identity politics and diversity will solve
the social, economic and political decay that besets the United
States. Not only are the former officers Black, but the city’s police
department is headed by Cerelyn Davis, a Black woman. None of this
helped Nichols, another victim of a modern-day police lynching.  ​

The militarists, corporatists, oligarchs, politicians, academics and
media conglomerates champion identity politics and diversity because
it does nothing to address the systemic injustices or the scourge of
permanent war that plague the U.S. It is an advertising gimmick, a
brand, used to mask mounting social inequality and imperial folly. It
busies liberals and the educated with a boutique activism, which is
not only ineffectual but exacerbates the divide between the privileged
and a working class in deep economic distress. The haves scold the
have-nots for their bad manners, racism, linguistic insensitivity and
garishness, while ignoring the root causes of their economic
distress. The oligarchs could not be happier...

If you stand with the oppressed, you will almost always end up being
treated like the oppressed. This is why the F.B.I., along with Chicago
police, murdered Fred Hampton and was almost certainly involved in the
murder of Malcolm X, who referred to impoverished urban neighborhoods
as 'internal colonies.'"

temperature DAFC, which could possibly replace those facilities using
natural gas in the future"

H2 Central: "The 1948 Chevrolet 3100 truck.. may look like a
traditional hot rod on the outside, but it hides something a bit
unconventional under the hood. While it draws juice from a
supercharged, 6.2-liter V8, the LS3 in question is not a
gas-guzzler. Instead of gulping gasoline to spin the wheels, the V8
unit feeds on hydrogen..

[Owner] says the hydrogen-powered V8 is capable of much more than
that. He will be able to demonstrate that once he gets his hands on a
set of bigger custom-made injectors.

Once installed, they will enable the V8 to deliver between 550 to 600
horsepower. All that with only water and steam coming out of the
exhaust pipe? Yup, it sounds like a great and efficient way to
keep big-displacement V8 engines alive"

Raising the retirement age? It needs to be lowered, as in down to 18. 
Noone should work bcz they have to. There is plenty of f-ing money -
govs will find it when they have to. They happily sink over a trillion
into a lackluster fighter plane, they surely can find some of
it for regular people.

That's like saying you can free yourself from the burdens of life by

Borne is supposedly "leftist" but sadly now turned into window
dressing for anti-left policies... The NYT piece is probably psyop
designed to generate symphathy for her so we forget about the recent
protests against the goverment trying to raise the retirement age..

It's not possible to be culturally Catholic in a Protestan majority
country and vica versa. Your codes will not allow it. If you try too
hard to be something else, you will become neurotic. This word is
associated with certain subgroup but there is Italian neuroticism too,
in quotes obviously "Italian" - same for Polish, and others. First
generation children and their descendants need to understand this
clearly - that fureign fuck talking shit with an accent (your elders)
is not similar to you. It's sad, but that is the truth.

---

Culture is transmitted at young age, subconciously, via osmosis -
through a land and its people, one on one, not through education,
stories, belief, or self-declaration.

---

All migrants are assimilated in one generation; the Turks in Anatolia
were no exception. Their initial culture is gone - almost nothing of
it remains. A form of language is around due to adminstrative,
military reasons, but that language is changed beyond recognition to
the extent that Anatolians today cannot understand "their cousins" in
Asia.
