H2 Central: "Martin Carolan, Provaris CEO said: '..This collaboration
will benefit from the synergies of Provaris and Gen2 Energyâ€™s approach
to using compression as an energy-efficient carrier for green
hydrogen.. to import pipeline-ready, gaseous green hydrogen to meet
the REPowerEU ambitions for 10 million tonnes by 2030'"

Upside Foods chief scientist was a reputable researcher before he was
at UF, made use of a lot of government grants I'm sure. If this
product takes off, hopefully their patent is made public by gov decree
shortly afterwards. Similar opening up of IP was applied to
[transistors](../../2020/03/appelbaum.html#transistor), that's why that
industry had energy, had lots of innovation.

ABC7: "For the first time, U.S. regulators on Wednesday approved the
sale of chicken made from animal cells, allowing two California
companies to offer "lab-grown" meat to the nation's restaurant tables
and eventually, supermarket shelves.

The Agriculture Department gave the green light to Upside Foods and
Good Meat, firms that had been racing to be the first in the U.S. to
sell meat that doesn't come from slaughtered animals - what's now
being referred to as 'cell-cultivated' or 'cultured' meat as it
emerges from the laboratory and arrives on dinner plates.

The move launches a new era of meat production aimed at eliminating
harm to animals and drastically reducing the environmental impacts of
grazing, growing feed for animals and animal waste.

'Instead of all of that land and all of that water that's used to feed
all of these animals that are slaughtered, we can do it in a different
way,' said Josh Tetrick, co-founder and chief executive of Eat Just,
which operates Good Meat"

France 24: "Polluted drinking water in France: Are pesticides the new
'forever' chemicals?  Water is a fundamental but fragile common
resource that's being increasingly depleted and polluted by human
activity. For several months now, traces of a pesticide called
chlorothalonil â€“ known as metabolites â€“ have been detected in drinking
water all over France, despite the pesticide being banned since
2020. How has France's most strictly controlled substance proven to be
so polluted?"

"China has implemented export controls on gallium, germanium, and
several other key compounds integral to semiconductor production. This
directive comes hot on the heels of the Netherlandsâ€™ decision to limit
Chinaâ€™s access to advanced chip manufacturing equipment [of ASML]"

---

The funny part is the sides create faux conflicts on those same issues
hiding near total agreement on their econ right-wing bent. Almost
anyone can find sustanance from the spectacle, on the fringes u could
even ask for comity / unity and manage to get attention, appear to
want to fix the faux problem but in actuality only addressing the
symptom... The existing bargain persists.. The viewers are left with
following this junk as if it is some kind of sane political discourse.

---

US is living its "peak [grand bargain](../../2023/06/evil-geniuses.html#thedeal)"
moment. The 70s deal btw the economic right and the cultural left
has reached its apex; both sides mistrusted, fought the government to
"gain freedom" for their own pet individuality goals and now are mired
either in gender-affirming care issues while the other side
routinely mows down others in mass killing sprees using their
individuality-affirming guns. Both sides, in a way, got what
they wanted. They created the current hellhole they are living in.

Informed Comment: "Taxpayers subsidize these more-than-ample [military
contractor] paychecks. Corporate giants like Boeing and Raytheon
depend on government contracts for about half the dollars they rake
in. For Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman, itâ€™s
at least 70 percent"

"The Warfare State: How Funding for Militarism Compromises Our
Welfare.. In FY 2023, out of a 1.8 trillion federal discretionary
budget, $1.1 trillion â€” or 62 percentâ€” was for militarized
programs.. Less than 2 out of every 5 dollar in federal discretionary
spending was available to fund investment in people and communities,
including primary and secondary public education, housing programs,
child care programs, federal disaster relief, environmental programs,
and scientific research"

Focus needs to be on the essentials, 2% generates 100% of the farm
products, similar advances are present in all essential sectors. Money
distribution within population cannot rely exclusively on "work"
something defined by employers who get almost all new money created
for them as credit. If the system forces this, as it does now, then we
get junk production, an econ mired in wage/inflation dilemma,
unchecked migration, and 85% of people hating their job. Most who
writes about and claims to know population dynamics do not understand
what the f--k is going on, especially as it relates to economics.

---

The comment is based on crooked accounting. Some look at tax revenue
coming in from (shit) work and money spent, there is mismatch, the
neophyte neolib goes "well we need more people to generate (shit)
products and services so we can tax them to fund government". ðŸ¤¨


"But we need to have more younger people to pay for older people"

NL Times: "Students from the Technical University of Delft established
a new world record last weekend. They succeeded in driving a hydrogen
car 2,488.4 kilometers in three days without refueling. Remarkably,
this feat was accomplished using just one kilogram of hydrogen. The
Guinness World Records officially recognized this achievement"

Changes of past 12 days - UA made some gains but so did RU. Heavy
losses reported for the Ukranian side and we know losses matter more
for Ukraine.

Without free open source software, most of the Big Tech would not
exist.

The Register: "[22/10, There are] universal problems that all
organizations face: resource allocation and opportunity cost. Meta is
going hell for leather for one big idea that is delusional
nonsense. Google's strategy of letting a thousand flowers bloom is a
recipe for a backyard filled with weeds. Both these things are
illnesses of the rich; you have the luxury of doing things badly for a
long time if the cash keeps flowing...

Linux, on the other hand, is anything but rich. Its ecosystem of
reward is enlightened self-interest, people and organizations that
commit time and minds. They understand the importance of making things
that matter and are very motivated to be a part of that. These
resources are limited.

There may seem to be no FOSS [free and open source software]
equivalent of Azure or AWS or Google Cloud Platform, but the
intellectual infrastructure that open source provides through the
ecosystem of libraries and frameworks is arguably as important to
modern IT as the cloud itself...

It's amazing how making money the motivator can break that down. One
cost of being rich is that you can ignore the outside world, or see it
as something to be bought. That shields against relevance to users"

True the concept's use is nebolous to the point that it is useless.

Wiki: "The word populism has been contested, mistranslated and used in
reference to a diverse variety of movements and beliefs. The political
scientist Will Brett characterised it as 'a classic example of a
stretched concept, pulled out of shape by overuse and misuse'"

A reminder 95% of new money is printed for businesses as credit by
private banks. If excessive "money printing" is a problem it is a
private sector problem.

Companies need to think ahead like BMW, when the BEV excitement dies
down they wont want to be stuck with servicing defunct technology,
should be able to quickly swap out the fire hazard battery with a
clean gas tank.

Auto Expres: "Hydrogen fuel-cell powertrains that can be refuelled in
minutes could be a zero-cost option across a range of BMW electric car
models by 2035.. Weâ€™re told that while BMWâ€™s latest FCEV prototype,
the iX5 Hydrogen, has two large gas tanks located centrally in the
vehicle, suppliers have worked hard to produce much smaller tanks
which can be sited in multiples within the chassis compartments
otherwise used for battery storage [for BEV models], while retaining
the same strength and overall capacity of 6kgs of hydrogen
gas. Innovations such as this, and the fact that itâ€™s much cheaper and
easier to recycle FCEVs at end of life compared to BEVs, will make it
possible for BMW to contemplate offering fuel cell power as a no-cost
option for customers"

*Severance* and *Silo* attracted some big names, and neither of them
do a good job of describing a dystopia, they seem to describe a
typical work day of some of the actors involved. In *Silo* people get
in and out of closed, cramped spaces, like in a movie set (?), in
*Severance* people arrive at work "leave their other self behind", in
the way an actor works. Both shows take a dive quickly.
