Taking this shit out of source codes will be FUN

Remember the scene in *Toy Story* where Buzz Lightyear jumps in air
wanting to fly, but with a succession of accidents stays in the air
for a while, and declares he is flying. Another toy says to him "you
are not flying, you are falling with style". That is precisely what's
going on with these neural net "AI" approaches, LLMs - they are
stupid, but they are stupid with style, their output sometimes looks
intelligent, either by chance (stochastically) or through a 
phenomenon known as [psychic's con](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist).

---

They are basically stupid

Melanie Mitchell: "Can Large Language Models Reason?.. [I]f LLMs rely
primarily on memorization and pattern-matching rather than true
reasoning, then they will not be generalizable—we can’t trust them to
perform well on 'out of distribution' tasks, those that are not
sufficiently similar to tasks they’ve seen in the training data...  If
LLMs Are Not Reasoning, What Are They Doing?..  Several researchers
have shown that LLMs are substantially better at solving problems that
involve terms or concepts that appear more frequently in their
training data, leading to the hypothesis that LLMs do not perform
robust abstract reasoning to solve problems, but instead solve
problems (at least in part) by identifying patterns in their training
data that match, or are similar to, or are otherwise related to the
text of the prompts they are given.

For example, a study by Razeghi et al. showed that some GPT-based LLMs
(pre-trained on a known corpus) were much better at arithmetic
problems that involved numbers that appeared frequently in the
pre-training corpus than those that appeared less frequently. These
models appear to lack a general ability for arithmetic, but instead
rely on a kind of “memorization”—matching patterns of text they have
seen in pre-training"

The Apple USB-c change will ultimately be beneficial for the
consumers.  But let's remember Apple was bitchslapped into it, by the
EU. Unfettered capitalism gives you walled gardens, lock-in. Only
regulation can shake things up, encourage corps to do the right thing.

When cloud co marketing uses the word "serverless" that's not exactly
true, they do have an app server. What they mean is co offers machines
with predefined services, preset APIs (could lead to lock-in,
careful), not blank hosts.

Many other read-only type services can be implemented in this static
site style.. without app server.

Schools clearly bet on the wrong technology - ed solutions need to be
based on true open architectures. DoEd can buy commodity hardware
(cheap as they will buying in bulk) and keep Ed software as "images"
on a DoEd server. Images are snapshots of a machine that has
everything kids need, you burn this image on each machine, give that
to students. A few visiting gov IT people for each school occasionally
can fix issues as they arise. Do not depend on some questionable
bidness "on the cloud".

"‘Chromebook Churn’ report highlights problems of short-lived laptops
in schools Chromebooks are not designed to last...Schools have piles
of working Chromebooks that have become e-waste because they’ve
expired...

Chromebooks have a built-in 'death date,' after which software support
ends. We expect milk to expire, but not laptops. Adding to customer
confusion, expiration dates are based on the certification of a given
model, not the purchase date. This means that consumers or schools can
buy a used or refurbished Chromebook thinking they’re getting a great
deal, only to be surprised when their new laptop expires after a year"

Browser side programs are usually in Javascript. But Imma test a new

A lot can be done via static files, even big ones. Some do not realize
but client can even read *parts* of a file on the web server, it's part
of the standard,

```python
from requests import get
url = "http://download.thinkbroadband.com/5MB.zip"
get(url, headers={"Range": "bytes=0-100"})
```

That gets only first 100 bytes. In theory one could even read parts of
a whole database if client knew how to seek/jump between the right
parts of the db file.. This is for read-only apps sure, still,
covers a lot of ground.

---

No need for a whole app server to offer search, static files can work
too (this blog's setup). IDEA: Create a search index offline, push the
index files on the the static site, client, with its code, can read
specific parts of the index, combine, sort them, and present results
on its end.

---

The hell with this "cloud".. Another dependency will be removed.. Time
to DIY

---

WTF happened to site search? Place search box on your page, connect to
ext search (Goog) showed search results for that site. Now bust.

potentially decrease to as low as 1.69 dollar/kg, making them highly
competitive when compared to gray hydrogen derived from fossil fuels,
known for its environmental impact"

at Stuttgart Airport next year. The Center, which is co-funded by the
regional ministry of transport will provide fuel cell aircraft
integration facilities and liquid hydrogen infrastructure.

H2FLY was founded by five engineers from the German Aerospace Center
in Stuttgart and the University of Ulm.. The company was acquired in
2021 by Joby Aviation, the California-based eVTOL aircraft developer"

Interesting Eng: "First liquid hydrogen-powered piloted plane soars
into sky.. H2FLY, the Stuttgart-based firm acquired by Joby Aviation
in 2021, completed four such flights in its HY4 demonstrator aircraft
fitted with a cutting-edge hydrogen-electric fuel cell propulsion
system and cryogenically stored liquid hydrogen..

Replacing gaseous hydrogen with liquid hydrogen effectively doubled
the maximum range of the HY4 aircraft from around 466 miles (750 km)
to approximately 932 miles (1,500 km), showing great promise for a
future with cleaner and more sustainable air travel"

The planes attacked the building on 9/11. Many died, both during and
after the terrible event.

<img width='340' src='allende-chile-911.jpg'/> 

We are talking about Chilean Air Force bombing the presidential
residence as part of a coup, photographed above. The date was
September 11, 1973, and the left-wing president Allende was
toppled. Pinochet would become president and usher in neo-liberal
reforms, jail opponents, opress political dissent. "Chicago Boys" were
asked to help, thanks to them, the new system would create inequality
and subsequently cause the 1982 monetary crisis.

September 11 for US was tragic too, but US reacted to it by telling
people "to shop more", and invaded a random country to benefit
Halliburton. Dare I say due to its actions US made its own 9/11 matter
less. From now on we will only commemorate the Chilean 9/11, not the
American one.

Trump: "We know collective action can be incredibly effective. In
July, UPS agreed to a deal with the Teamsters Union in which, on
average, the annual salary of full-time drivers will be raised to
$170,000, including healthcare and other benefits.

What the rich and the politicians they own have succeeded in doing
since the Reagan administration, is convincing white working-class
Americans that unions are the enemy of working people, and
trickle-down economics (essentially tax cuts for the very rich) will,
counterintuitively, lead to economic equality. These are lies"
