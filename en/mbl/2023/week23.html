<p>H2 Central: "Mercedes-Benz and H2 Green Steel announce agreements in
both Europe and North America"</p>
<hr />
<p>"@r000t@fosstodon.org</p>
<p>It's the ten year anniversary of the Snowden leaks.</p>
<p>But for some reason, some strange, strange reason.... No news about
it.</p>
<p>Plenty of articles about the super harvest wolf spider blood moon w/
cheese tho"</p>
<hr />
<p>"The Minister for Environment and Water Tanya Plibersek has vowed to
take action on sustainability in the fashion industry.. 'It's actually
a quarter of a million tonnes of clothing going into landfill every
year - it's pretty hard to conceptualize how big an amount that
is... And of course, there's the waste. There's the economic waste of
using something a few times and sticking it in the landfill. But
there's also the huge environmental impact of doing that'</p>
<p>Alongside waste, Plibersek said some clothes that break down release
microplastics into the soil, which end up in water streams. 'The
average Australians is ingesting a credit card's worth of
microplastics every week, through the food we consume as it gets into
our food cycle, through the water we drink'"</p>
<hr />
<p>First Post: "Even America's biggest bank [JP Morgan] says
de-dollarisation is a trend here to persist"</p>
<hr />
<p>"Electric cars are powered by gigantic batteries, and they are all fun
and games until it gets cold. Then many owners find that their range
can fall even with a full charge, similary when the weather gets too
hot. [BEVs] are at their peak performance at 21 C, anything above or
below that will result in performance loss.</p>
<p>But a far bigger problem is battery degradation. For example the Tesla
Model S has an annual degradation rate of 2.3% according to a Geotab
article, then around year 4 of ownership you are already down to 90%.
This is a big issue in terms of car's reusability and the second hand
market. If you buy a 10 year old used electric car you have to pay
both for the car and a new battery which costs thousands, potentially
tens of thousands dollars extra, not to mention who will process the
millions of discarded batteries each year should EVs get popular
enough?</p>
<p>But even a bigger problem is [BEV being a fire hazard]. Electric car
batteries are technically safe unless you keep them at suboptimum
conditions, meaning in areas where the temparature isn't at 21 C and
the roads aren't perfectly smooth - which tends to happen around the
globe. If you run an EV in, say, hot climate, on bumpy roads that
shake the battery around for years there is a higher chance that it
will spontaneously combust"</p>

<p>BH theory rests on presence of singularities.. But as the author
suggests whereever u look in the sky and take a measurement you always
get a number, never a "singularity measurement". It doesn't mean the
field equations are wrong, they are just incomplete.</p>
<p>Paper: "Naked singularities were disliked from the beginning of BH
history, in particular by Penrose.. So far, no spot in the sky has
ever looked to me like containing a naked singularity. With sufficient
care, all our maps have always allowed interpretations by nonsingular
condensations of matter, not too dissimilar from our solar system"</p>

<p>LeBlanc: "We emphasize again the totally inconsistent physical basis
of Black Hole Thermodynamics (BHTD) and its spinoff theories, the
Holographic Principle (HP) and Emergent Gravity (EG). A thermal
description simply does not exist for systems with negative heat
capacity. No such thermally equilibrated systems are to be found
anywhere in nature. As is universally known, positivity of the heat
capacity is the necessary mathematical requirement for the thermal
equilibrium ensemble description to exist. Claims to the contrary is
phony physics"</p>

<p>The Holographic Principle, 3D universe being a representation of a 2D

from "black holes", but none of this stuff including black holes are
exactly proven by measurements.</p>

route-planning and establishment of the new American Perimeter

massive thru hike established not just for recreation, but as a means
of conserving the land for generations to come. 'I’m not creating the
next great thru hike, I’m creating America’s next biggest volunteer

<p>The Conversation: "Why 40°C is bearable in a desert but lethal in the
tropics..  heatwaves of similar magnitudes can have very different
impacts depending on factors like humidity.. Our bodies gain heat from
the air around us, from the sun, or from our own internal processes
such as digestion and exercise. In response to this, our bodies must
lose some heat. Some of this we lose directly to the air around
us.. But most heat is lost through sweating,.. higher humidity means
that the rate of evaporation from our skin will decrease.. Underlying
health conditions and other personal circumstances can lead to some
people being more vulnerable to heat stress"</p>

<p>Forbes: "At the expo, Bosch showcased its industrial prowess by
demonstrating not only its ability to manufacture the fuel cell stack
itself but also a plethora of related components. This comprehensive
range includes pressure and safety hardware for hydrogen tanks,
hydrogen flow control systems, air compressors, cooling systems, power
control and inverters, electric motors, and one of the most
challenging elements—the control and interface software. Vehicle
developers could approach Bosch and virtually find everything they
need to transition to hydrogen.</p>
<p>According to Matt Thorington, 'The biggest thing for Bosch is we're
all in on hydrogen. It's not just a technology for the next 10 years;
we firmly believe that its time is now. We are industrializing the
components and systems for markets in Europe, the US, and China'"</p>
