<p>Weekend Reading: How survey-centric political reporting distracts and
distorts our understanding of American politics.. [On current
political reporting on polls, particularly around demographic
trends..W]hen it comes to specific demographic groups or subgroups,
the differences in partisanship we see from poll to poll are almost
entirely noise. By 'noise,' I mean the completely predictable static
that comes from pollingâ€™s inherent margins of error, as well as the
heavy weighting that is now standard given vanishingly low response
rates. This means that almost any time the media writes about
demographic trends in partisanship, itâ€™s not offering us important new
information; itâ€™s just narrating noise â€“ conflating inevitable
statistical and methodological variation with changes in votersâ€™
preferences. The mediaâ€™s amplification of this noise drowns out any
possibility of discussion or analysis that would help Americans
understand the actual dynamics of elections or the real stakes.</p>
