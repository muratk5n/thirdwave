<p>Why not Mini PC rather than SBC? Mini PCs can be compact, run fast,
have HDMI output.  But they are marketed as PC replacements (hence the
name) therefore have the power req to match. Tough to run them in a
completely mobile setting. SBC use less power, obviously there is a
tradeoff, latter may not be as responsive running all tasks as Mini
PCs can be. MPC attemps to match PCs even in gaming. </p>

<p>"@JessTheUnstill@infosec.exchange</p>
<p>Most of the time, no it doesn't make sense for businesses to run like
a government.</p>
<p>Part of government services is that in order to actually cover 100% of
people, it's going to require massively overbuilding the
infrastructure to ensure that there's enough resources to handle even
the edge cases - despite the fact that those edge cases oftentimes
aren't 'profitable' to serve.</p>
<p>Take, for example, USPS vs FedEx. The remit of USPS is to deliver mail
to EVERY SINGLE ADDRESS IN THE COUNTRY. Yes, even the ones that
require taking a sea plane 500 miles into rural Alaska to serve a
village of a dozen customers. FedEx, on the other hand, will only
serve the addresses that it finds profitable to do so.</p>
<p>When conservatives want to 'government like a business', part of
what they're saying is that they simply want to not serve the parts of
the population that aren't 'profitable'. But profit should never be
the point of government services. It's defining what services are
worth providing to every single citizen, and ensuring that they're
delivered to them - yes, even the ones that are far more difficult to
provide"</p>

<p>EU IR Rep Borell: "There is no hierarchy between horrors. One horror
does not justify another horror. And the pain that you inflict on
children of others, will not justify never, will not compensate the
pain your children have been suffering. On the contrary, it will
create a violent spiral that will come once again unless we got a
peace, a sustainable peace.</p>
<p>That is why the European Union has called for immediate humanitarian
pauses, and the United Nations Security Council.. adopted a very
important resolution asking for immediate, urgent and sustained
humanitarian pauses..</p>
<p>I want to remind that the decisions of UN Security Council are not
just words. They are compulsory, they have to be implemented.</p>
<p>But this resolution has not been implemented, not yet. To the
contrary, the bombing has continued. I have to recall that this
decision of the UN Security Council has to be implemented. Too many

<p>The Guardian: "The European Union has become the first international
body to criminalise wide-scale environmental damage 'comparable to
ecocide'. Late on Thursday, lawmakers agreed an update to the bloc’s
environmental crime directive punishing the most serious cases of
ecosystem destruction, including habitat loss and illegal logging,
with tougher penalties. Marie Toussaint, a French lawyer and MEP
heading EU efforts to criminalise ecocide, said the decision 'marks
the end of impunity for environmental criminals' and could usher in a
new age of environmental litigation in Europe"</p>

<p>Ravi: "[Al Jazeera] On the question of Palestine India's independence
leaders Mahatma Ghandi and Nehru were vocal in their support. In 1936
when Palestinians rose up against the British and their push for a
Jewish state, Nehru compared Palestine with India under colonial
rule. He talked about gross betrayal of Arabs by the British
imperialism. 'Palestine was not an empty land, it was well populated
with little room for large numbers of colonists. Is it any wonder that
the Arabs objected to this intrusion?' A little more than 10 years
later when the UN voted to create the state of Israel, there were only
three non-Arab countries that voted against that resolution. India was
one of them"</p>

Result of a lifetime of work.. But that's it! 🤨 That doesn't make

no evidence China can make those components 'at scale'"</p>
