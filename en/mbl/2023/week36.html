part of an intensifying campaign against the emissions-spewing
lifestyles of the ultrawealthy"</p>

<p>Andersen, <em>Evil Geniuses</em>: The spectacular rightward swerve of legal
thought starting in the 1980s had two freshly cast ideological
pillars, one focusing narrowly on the Constitution, the other on more
general criteria for determining proper legal outcomes... The one
concerning the Constitution became known in the 1980s as
<em>originalism</em>... Originalism‚Äôs most important hidden agenda was to
keep courts and judges completely out of the business of business, as
if what worked for the U.S. economy for its first century, before
modern corporations existed, was how things should work today...</p>
<p>As movements, originalism in the law and libertarianism in economics
were fraternal twins. Both were born of extreme nostalgia, fetishizing
and distorting bygone America, so both more easily achieved mass
appeal in the everything-old-is-new-again 1970s and ‚Äô80s. Both
purported to be based on objective principles that transcended mere
politics or special interests, even while both were vehicles for big
business and the right to recover, fortify, and expand their economic
and political power"</p>
