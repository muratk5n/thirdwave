Science: "(ARPA-E), the high-risk, high-reward arm of the Department
of Energy (DOE), announced it would fund $20 million in grants to
advance technologies for extracting clean-burning hydrogen from deep
rocks. At the moment, all of the world‚Äôs hydrogen is manufactured
industrially. But some researchers have concluded that, contrary to
conventional wisdom, Earth harbors vast deposits of the gas that could
be tapped like oil"

experimental hydrogen-powered Hilux truck fitted with Mirai-sourced

Partially funded by the British government, and built in the United

the drivetrain uses hydrogen..

The truck is expected to deliver over 365 miles of driving range,
which Toyota notes is "significantly further than might be achieved
using a battery-electric system." [another product] Ford's F-150

regulations.. There will be fines of up to 10 percent of a firm's
global revenues for breaking some of the most serious competition
rules, and even up to 20 percent for repeat offenders...

progression of smaller companies that threaten to become rivals by
gobbling them up through takeovers.

The EU believes past examples of this are Facebook's buyouts
of¬†Instagram¬†and WhatsApp as well as Google's purchase of YouTube and
Waze. One major change under the DMA is the rule that forces
interoperability between messaging apps, making it easier for users to

Big Data was a revolution - neural net based artificial parrot

Math changes with incremental processing; eg averaging bunch of
numbers, one could bring da whooole thing to memory sum up the whooole
thing then divide that number by a count. Incremental averaging is
different.. You are keeping a running average constantly which is
updated, one line at a time, so you always know the average up to that
point. There are incremental versions for almost every computing task,
clustering, linear algebra, u name it.

---

Some infra even split big files in multiple machines so processing
could be sent to indiv commodity machines close to data which could
then incremental process their pieces. That was Hadoop.

---

The data analysis revolution of 2010s actually was built on this
simple advancement, processing huge files one line at a time. We
changed a lot of our computational science approaches to fit this
mold, because along with it came much increased capability.

Add up changes of a function starting from $a$ on $f(a)$, you will reach

f(b) - f(a)$. But of course one needs such rigour too bcz it helps
down the line with other formulations.

Andersen, *Evil Geniuses*: The spectacular rightward swerve of legal
thought starting in the 1980s had two freshly cast ideological
pillars, one focusing narrowly on the Constitution, the other on more
general criteria for determining proper legal outcomes... The one
concerning the Constitution became known in the 1980s as
*originalism*... Originalism‚Äôs most important hidden agenda was to
keep courts and judges completely out of the business of business, as
if what worked for the U.S. economy for its first century, before
modern corporations existed, was how things should work today...

As movements, originalism in the law and libertarianism in economics
were fraternal twins. Both were born of extreme nostalgia, fetishizing
and distorting bygone America, so both more easily achieved mass
appeal in the everything-old-is-new-again 1970s and ‚Äô80s. Both
purported to be based on objective principles that transcended mere
politics or special interests, even while both were vehicles for big
business and the right to recover, fortify, and expand their economic
and political power"
