<p>üòÜ üòÜ üòÜ So <em>The West Wing</em>.. Constant drama. Were there aides,
passing papers to each other in the hallway?</p>
<p>WaPo: "[The honorary chairman of the U.S. bid for the 2022 tournament]
Bill Clinton reportedly smashed a mirror after hearing Qatar won the

<p>But Al Jazeera is a good channel, a good source for info most of the
time. Just saying these are some of the things that go through my mind
when docus like that show up.</p>
<hr />
<p>I guess FIFA/Qatar tried to make the best of it by trying to organize
a good Cup, and making sure (!) Argentina got the Prize (that penalty
in the last game.. shady).</p>
<hr />
<p>Aahh the 2010s.. Qatar was on the move, on the rise, helping "topple
dictators" Kaddafi, Mubarak, stirring shit up along with US all over
the globe.. Woo hooo! We have arrived baby! Winning the rights to host
the 2022 FIFA World Cup was part of that rise. We know the rest of the
story - the Arab Spring turned sour (along with Qatar's claim for the
top spot), the allegation of bribery of FIFA officials became so
rampant it destroyed the careers of all involved, including then chief
S. Blatter. </p>
<hr />

<hr />
<p>Hah. Al Jazeera docu defends their involvement in the Arab Spring as
siding with "democracy". That's not exactly true, especially thinking
AJ's money source, Qatar. Why would Qatar, an emirate care about
democracy?  They cared more about spreading their own influence in the
region, and to supplant Saudi Arabia as a power center.</p>
