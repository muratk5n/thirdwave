Reuters: "Saudi Arabia's NEOM Green Hydrogen Company (NGHC) has signed
financial documents with 23 local, regional and international banks
and investment firms on a green hydrogen production facility at a
total investment value of $8.4 billion.

NGHC, a joint venture between ACWA Power, Air Products and NEOM, will
produce 600 tonnes a day of carbon-free hydrogen by the end of 2026
using 4 GW of solar energy, the statement said"

If neoliberalism did not turn out to be the shitshow it is today and
actually worked for people, and they wanted to put up a statue to
honor it, the monument would have those three guys, Pinochet, Reagan
and Rupert. I would use [this picture](../mbl/0119/2016/murdoch.jpg) with
the newspaper headline engraved in stone for Rupert..

---

Pinochet's coup in Chile allowed the "Chicago boys" to practice their
mucky art unimpeded for a while in isolation. 'The revolution" was copied
to other countries later.

---

The three key events of neolib history, the Pinochet coup in Chile,
Reagan's firing of 11,000 striking air traffic controllers, and that
Murdoch thing with the print union workers. That is how Rupert got to
join the pantheon.

Lowe: "Why AlphaFold [NN in biology] won’t revolutionise drug
discovery.. DeepMind’s AlphaFold team has been having quite a run of
success in predicting protein structures. This has long been
considered one of the truly difficult problems in computational
biology..

[But] some of the headlines have betrayed real misunderstandings about
what’s been accomplished. First off, as I wrote here earlier this
year, we have not made sudden huge leaps in understanding why proteins
fold like they do. The AlphaFold people have made great progress in
recognising different known protein folding motifs and assembling them
into structures that are very often correct. Forming these coils,
loops, and sheets is what proteins generally do, but ‘why?’ doesn’t
enter into it...

It also needs to be emphasised that (as carefully worded above) what
we have are predictions and not real protein structures. They’re good
predictions and useful ones, but obtaining actual data (from x-ray,
NMR, or cryo-electron microscopy) is the only way to be sure how
correct they are.. That’s why press coverage about how this new
prediction database will revolutionise drug discovery are overblown"

Lerner: "To everyone who sees them, the new James Webb Space Telescope
(JWST) images of the cosmos are beautifully awe-inspiring. But to most
professional astronomers and cosmologists, they are also extremely
surprising—not at all what was predicted by theory. In the flood of
technical astronomical papers published online since July 12, the
authors report again and again that the images show surprisingly many
galaxies, galaxies that are surprisingly smooth, surprisingly small
and surprisingly old.  Lots of surprises, and not necessarily pleasant
ones. [One paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09428)’s title begins
with the candid exclamation: “Panic!”

Why do the JWST’s images inspire panic among cosmologists? And what
theory’s predictions are they contradicting? The papers don’t actually
say. The truth that these papers don’t report is that the hypothesis
that the JWST’s images are blatantly and repeatedly contradicting is
the Big Bang Hypothesis"

Same problem different country. Either unelected bureucrats run the
country, or elected politicians do. Make up your mind. Can't have
both.

CNBC: "Thailand’s Move Forward party swept up a majority of votes in a
historic election but the official result will only be delivered a
month from now... If the Move Forward party officially wins, its
controversial policies could threaten the military and the monarchy.
Ruling elites could ban Move Forward, just like its predecessor Future
Forward, but that raises the risk of more street protests"

Military talks too much. Stop meddling in politics. Go back to your

The Japan Times: "Uncertainty in Pakistan as military faces

charges earlier this month, which he says was at the behest of the
generals, led to violent nationwide protests, including attacks on
military buildings and on the homes of senior officers"

Murdoch.. This guy was there when it all started. A neolib legend.

Wiki: "The Wapping dispute was a lengthy failed strike by print
workers in London in 1986. Print unions tried to block distribution of
*The Sunday Times*, along with other newspapers in Rupert Murdoch's
News International group, after production was shifted to a new plant
in Wapping in January 1986... All of the workers were dismissed. The
failure of the strike was devastating for the print union workers, and
it led both to a general decline in trade union influence in the
UK... Along with the miners' strike of 1984–85, the Wapping dispute
was a significant defeat in the history of the British trade union
movement"

Politico: "[Matthew Desmond] makes a refreshing, brutally honest case
that poverty is pervasive in America by design, to enable the
lifestyles of affluent people. U.S. rates of poverty are substantially
higher and more extreme than those found in 25 other developed OECD
countries.. [His] greatest contribution is changing the lens from
individual behavior — the hoary focus of so many books about poverty —
to asking and answering the larger question, 'Who benefits from
practices that keep people poor?' Poverty, he argues, results from
three quintessentially American habits: exploitation of the poor;
subsidization of the rich; and the intentional segregation of the
affluent and the poor such that opportunity is hoarded and social
mobility is rare"

Lack of understanding will get you in harder problems. The real world

AlphaGo Zero was sadly another example of weak AI parroting; AG0
generated its own data, played against itself and learned from that,
meaning it compressed it and "made art" from it, a dataset of over 4
million datapoints. Its programmers did make some legit algorithmic
design improvements in a certain tree search approach (human coded,
not deepfaked by an parrot moron algo), but the rest is... simple
compression. Sample games are compressed into a neural net, for
subsequent games computer can make similar moves "inspired" by that
training data..  The machinery does not truly understand the game of Go.
