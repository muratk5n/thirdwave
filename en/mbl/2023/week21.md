# Week 21

Same problem different country. Either unelected bureucrats run the
country, or elected politicians do. Make up your mind. Can't have
both.

CNBC: "Thailand’s Move Forward party swept up a majority of votes in a
historic election but the official result will only be delivered a
month from now... If the Move Forward party officially wins, its
controversial policies could threaten the military and the monarchy.
Ruling elites could ban Move Forward, just like its predecessor Future
Forward, but that raises the risk of more street protests"

Military talks too much. Stop meddling in politics. Go back to your
barracks. Get a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up.

The Japan Times: "Uncertainty in Pakistan as military faces
unprecedented challenge to authority.. Khan’s arrest on corruption
charges earlier this month, which he says was at the behest of the
generals, led to violent nationwide protests, including attacks on
military buildings and on the homes of senior officers"

No wonder his Fox News had problems with Tucker, he was consorting
with the enemy, giving voice to too many leftists.

Murdoch.. This guy was there when it all started. A neolib legend.

Wiki: "The Wapping dispute was a lengthy failed strike by print
workers in London in 1986. Print unions tried to block distribution of
*The Sunday Times*, along with other newspapers in Rupert Murdoch's
News International group, after production was shifted to a new plant
in Wapping in January 1986... All of the workers were dismissed. The
failure of the strike was devastating for the print union workers, and
it led both to a general decline in trade union influence in the
UK... Along with the miners' strike of 1984–85, the Wapping dispute
was a significant defeat in the history of the British trade union
movement"

Politico: "[Matthew Desmond] makes a refreshing, brutally honest case
that poverty is pervasive in America by design, to enable the
lifestyles of affluent people. U.S. rates of poverty are substantially
higher and more extreme than those found in 25 other developed OECD
countries.. [His] greatest contribution is changing the lens from
individual behavior — the hoary focus of so many books about poverty —
to asking and answering the larger question, 'Who benefits from
practices that keep people poor?' Poverty, he argues, results from
three quintessentially American habits: exploitation of the poor;
subsidization of the rich; and the intentional segregation of the
affluent and the poor such that opportunity is hoarded and social
mobility is rare"

Others in the Gulf were involved in Syria conflict too, but Qatar took

Lack of understanding will get you in harder problems. The real world
is not a constrained, finite-space Go board. It is messy. That's why
neural net based cars still [cannot drive safely](https://futurism.com/experts-alarmed-tesla-fsd).

---

AlphaGo Zero was sadly another example of weak AI parroting; AG0
generated its own data, played against itself and learned from that,
meaning it compressed it and "made art" from it, a dataset of over 4
million datapoints. Its programmers did make some legit algorithmic
design improvements in a certain tree search approach (human coded,
not deepfaked by an parrot moron algo), but the rest is... simple
compression. Sample games are compressed into a neural net, for
subsequent games computer can make similar moves "inspired" by that
training data..  The machinery does not truly understand the game of Go.
