# Week 11


"@TimmermansEU@respublicae.eu

RT @EUClimateAction: Renewable #Hydrogen can help us meet our climate goals.  
 
Today, we have announced the European Hydrogen Bank, which will: 
 
- connect supply and demand across üá™üá∫ 

- boost domestic uptake  

- expand production internationally"

SVB was offering up to 4.5% yield on deposits before it collapsed.. Wow

2-Year does look little better than 10-year, but not by much.. if
bought in 2020, SVB would still be in trouble.

All bond yields went up, their prices went down, so if you had to
sell bonds at a hurry had to sell sell them at a loss.

"One refrain we‚Äôve heard lately is that Silicon Valley Bank failed
because it took risks that turned sour. The specific kind of risk in
the limelight right now is what‚Äôs known in financial circles as
duration risk... The bank was flooded with deposits after the start of
the pandemic, and it invested a large chunk of them in long-term
government bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which paid a higher
yield than short-term Treasuries. 'Had they invested in two years or
less, they would have taken a much smaller hit,' he said.. Worth
noting, SVB‚Äôs losses were only on paper ‚Äî that is, until the bank
needed to offload those bonds quickly as depositors rushed for the
exits"

The Atlantic: "Boycott Bans Are an Assault on Free Speech.. America
began with boycotts. Angry about Britain‚Äôs tax raises, the historian
T. H. Breen writes, American colonists saw their refusal to purchase
British goods as a 'reflexive response to taxation without
representation'..

I think what‚Äôs really offensive about the anti-BDS laws in particular
is the way that they single out not even boycotts generally, but on
this one specific issue for special penalties‚ÄîI think that really
gives the game away that the government is trying to suppress specific
viewpoints here,‚Äù Brian Hauss, an attorney for the ACLU, which
challenged the Arkansas law and several others like it, told me"

Holywood's obsession with the multiverse concept is likely for
gaslighting, distraction.. MV creates an illusion of a "multiplicity
of options", regular citizen might be suffering in real life, but then
goes to a movie theater watches a "multiverse movie" and starts
feeling good about himself.. Maybe there is another him out there in a
parallel world who is better off? Add little time travel future him
can time travel to his old (current) self and help him (creating "new
branches" in the MV too bro, but it's all good). So many
options... Intoxicating. Poor person does not know where to start.  I
guess with so many options his current sorry state is his fault, which
could be the main point of the exercise. Psyop.

NYT: "Inside the Global Race to Turn Water Into Fuel..

A consortium of energy companies led by BP plans to cover an expanse
of land eight times as large as New York City with as many as 1,743
wind turbines, each nearly as tall as the Empire State Building, along
with 10 million or so solar panels and more than a thousand miles of
access roads to connect them all. But none of the 26 gigawatts of
energy the site expects to produce, equivalent to a third of what
Australia‚Äôs grid currently requires, will go toward public
use. Instead, it will be used to manufacture a novel kind of
industrial fuel: green hydrogen. This patch of desert, more than 100
miles from the nearest town, sits next to the biggest problem that
green hydrogen could help solve: vast iron ore mines that are full of
machines powered by immense amounts of dirty fossil fuels. Three of
the world‚Äôs four biggest ore miners operate dozens of mines
here.Proponents hope green hydrogen will clean up not only mining but
other industries by replacing fossil fuel use in steel making,
shipping, cement and elsewhere..

Last year, government subsidies sped up action in the European Union,
India, Australia, the United States and elsewhere. The Inflation
Reduction Act, the Biden administration‚Äôs landmark climate
legislation, aims to drive the domestic cost of green hydrogen down to
a quarter of what it is now in less than a decade through tax
incentives and $9.5 billion in grants. 'We are about to jump from the
starting blocks,' said Anja-Isabel Dotzenrath, who once led Germany‚Äôs
biggest renewable energy company and now runs BP‚Äôs gas and low-carbon
operations. 'I think hydrogen will grow even faster than wind and
solar have.'"

For Prez elections the ultimate Hail Mary was from the Rep side during
the 2000 election. I don't mean to downplay the skills of other
campaigns who also won... Maybe they too had it in them to snatch a
win out of the lion's den, just snatching that shit, snatching it and
going home with the trophy.. Maybe. But we didn't see those campaigns,
we almost exclusively saw the ones who won with an advantage. I need to
base the take on data.

Previous share on AI+ethics debate is similar in spirit to AI+doomsday
debate. In both cases the underlying assumption / message is the tech
is *that good*. It's a good trick, sales-by-presumption. If A implies
B develop arguments as if B is already true, which telegrams A is a
done deal. These c--suckers are always selling...

Taxpayers are absolutely on the hook for SVIB bailout. Gov covered not
just some, but all depositors; and the bank's total deposits reach
over $170 billion - no pocket change.

But if gov works the books, spreads the damage forwards can reap some
if not all loss... it's possible.

Need to stress the approach can fail sometimes

Seeking Alpha: "1953 and 1957 [recessions], were not preceded by yield
curve inversions. So this concept is not perfect by any means"

"The curve" has indeed inverted (longer maturity treasuries have lower
yield than shorter ones) which some take as a signal of recession.

Some banks need to fail, it is a sign the system is punishing bad
management. See the plot below, \# of bank bankruptcies per year, data
from FDIC. Notice the two years when there were **zero** bank
closures.  2005, and 2006. What happened afterwards? ü§î

```python
url = 'https://www.fdic.gov/bank/historical/bank/bfb-data.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url,parse_dates=['Closing Date'])
df['year'] = df['Closing Date'].dt.year
dfg = pd.DataFrame(index=range(2001,2023))
dfg['closures'] = df.groupby('year').size()
dfg.fillna(0).plot(grid=True)
