# Week 13

Attempting to coexist with an existing fiat system invites undue
problems for both sides; new money's selling point will be freer,
easier exchange and that invites crime, money laundering. Over years
old fiat added all sorts of safeguards, which the Wild West of the new
threatens to run roughshod over burning big and small users, something
old fiat gov cannot ignore (ppl vote). When mildly integrated into the
old, the new is a speculation plaything, pushing it away from its
original mission. Lose-lose all around.

Money is inextricably tied to politics / governance. There is no
"politics free money". Unlike what some naive libertarians seem to
think even gold was tied to a system - [kings made it possible](0119/2011/11/debt-religions-money.html), 
without them there would be no gold currency. Therefore, hard to change
currency (ie to crypto) without changing governance, at a
fundamental level.

2011 was a good time to do it, they gave that success to the black

The left hand, and the right hand..  One does not know the other. But
sometimes, the right hand can leave bread crums for left hand to find,
to force action on a certain problem.. Through friends in Pakistani
ISI US deep state knew where Bin Laden was kept. It's all about
information. Once you know that location, you sit on it, and you own
his ass. Then, at the right time, the "invisible hand" will release
the info where it can be "discovered" by the other hand because it is
obvious what they will do with that information, attempt to kill Bin
Laden, which they did. As most know by now BL was killed at a
residence half a mile away from a Pak military training academy.

.. A typical EV contains more toxic electronic components than a
couple of desktop computers. A typical small EV is run by over 1000lb
of toxic and carcinogenic lithium battery which is very expensive to
recycle and hence will never be 100% recycled"

GreenBiz: "[T]he lithium-ion batteries used in BEVs are expected to
cause a serious environmental crisis when they reach the end of their
useful lives..  Several studies, including one by Argonne National

electricity to power battery EVs"

The inflation of faux ethnic "heritage" or PC identities help alienate
the common man from the rest; they want your being chopped up into
tiniest little pieces so it will be impossible for you to identify
with a fellow citizen, and especially with the plight of the common
man or woman. The further away the system makes one from the masses,
in mentality, in general feeling, the better off they are.  Fellow
citizen is one paycheck away from bankruptcy but shitlib looks at him
and thinks 'does he identify as non-binary, genderqueer, metrosexual?
Is he Estonian / Scottish, Scottish / Italian, she/him/they, Polish /
Eskimo / Whateverfuck?' All these labels create artificial obstacles
for relating.. which likely is the aim.

Formulation, theory requires more than "functions". In materials
science a steel beam under stress has the displacement formula
$E I \frac{d^4 y}{d X_1^4} = q$ , a fourth order dif eq, that ain't a
function. When solved w given cond result is one, and a different
one for each condition; all from the same base formula. AI has a
long way to go.

---

There has been some clumsy attempts to create "theoretical basis of
AI" I remember one proof that equated learning with compression - if
one cld compress certain data one can learn that data. But, the way
they defined learning (they called "PAC learning") was such that
naturally compression would be the obvious answer, which isn't that
interesting at all. You assume inputs, outputs and a "function" in
between, what the flack else could be the outcome? A smaller
representation in terms of a function, which is, compression.

"[Workers at a] construction company noticed something odd about their
Xerox photocopier: when they made a copy of the floor plan of a house,
the copy differed from the original in a subtle but significant
way... a modern Xerox photocopier.. scans the document digitally, and
then prints the resulting image file. Combine that with the fact that
virtually every digital image file is compressed to save space, and a
solution to the mystery begins to suggest itself...  Lossy compression
is often used for photos, audio, and video in situations in which
absolute accuracy isn’t essential...

Think of ChatGPT as a blurry jpeg of all the text on the Web. It
retains much of the information on the Web, in the same way that a
jpeg retains much of the information of a higher-resolution image,
but, if you’re looking for an exact sequence of bits, you won’t find
it; all you will ever get is an approximation"

material for hydrogen energy devices. The new material has high proton
conductivity and unusual properties (depending on the degree of
doping). It can be used as an electrolyte (at high doping levels) and
as an electrode (at low doping levels) in solid oxide fuel cells and
electrolyzers.. This allows these materials to be used as electrodes
for.. both solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) and electrolyzers"

"Ben" has some interesting observations on crypto land..

Prospect: "Signature Bank had reinvented itself as one of the
crypto-friendliest banks in America, possibly to offset an unusual
slump in its previous client base, the New York City landlord
class. But while the big bet had shrunk its stock price, Signature
seemed to have weathered Crypto Winter all right until a hysterical
billionaire bank run took out Silicon Valley Bank on March 10...

[I]t’s a uniquely American feature of political and
financial crises that the characters our systems hold accountable for
their bottomless supply of elaborate malfeasance seem always to lean
toward the implausibly clownish. A conspicuously impaired 22-year-old
named Lynndie England bore responsibility for a sprawling assembly
line of physical and psychological torture at Abu Ghraib while her
higher-ups skated; a 30-year-old Goldman Sachs trader nicknamed
“Fabulous Fab” was the most senior bulge bracket bank executive
indicted in the multitrillion subprime CDO racket while his hedge fund
clients walked away billionaires.

So it goes with the gargantuan phalanx of flimflammers and rug-pullers
who sold America’s debt-enslaved youth on the fever dream of the
blockchain. Yes, SBF is behind bars, but.. billionaires who
shamelessly shilled for so many other interconnected
cash-for-counterfeit schemes just orchestrated a $42 billion bank run
and were instantly rewarded with an unprecedented bailout"

This word became prevalent with the US deep state project ISIS who
called themselves "a worldwide caliphate" which tells you what the
shadowy figures in the dark corners of US policy want to happen in the
Islamic world. They would like to have a Caliphate which they could
influence, the label could be used as a wrecking ball, hit one
goverment or the other when they disagree, manufacture managed chaos
which then could further be utilized as a pretext for operations "to
bring democracy" there.

---

An official Caliph no longer exists; the title was abolished when the
last Ottoman mucker holding it was stripped of it, and later the royal
family fled from Stanpoli to UK en masse anyway (to UK, interesting
isn't it?). Saudi Arabia is not a caliphate, they are the keepers of
the holy sites, but SA ruler is not a caliph. Neither is the Egyptian
head of gov, or UAE, or even Jordan (where the current king is a
descendant of Mohammad).

American complains "women cannot go to school in Afghanistan". You
lost your chance to improve that country when u failed to switch AFG
agro from [ophium to cotton](../../2023/01/little-america-chandrasekaran.html).
Livelihood trumps school. Improvement in livelihood could pave the way
for more changes. Now you are out, and oppo kicked your ass on the way out.
Why constantly whine about it?

---

That whole "Taiwan is so close to China" observation (suggesting they
can invade easily) was probably to argue that he didn't want to defend
Taiwan, strategically speaking. Factually, US *could* help defend
China even with the proximity problem. People in politics can change
facts to argue an opinion sometimes, DJT more than others.

---

Trump changed some aspects of CH rel but he wasn't too anti-China.
There are Reps 10 times more hawkish.
