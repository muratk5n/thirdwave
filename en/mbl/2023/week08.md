# Week 8


Science.org: "The Malian discovery was vivid evidence for what a small
group of scientists, studying hints from seeps, mines, and abandoned
wells, had been saying for years: Contrary to conventional wisdom,
large stores of natural hydrogen may exist all over the world, like
oil and gasâ€”but not in the same places. These researchers say
water-rock reactions deep within the Earth continuously generate
hydrogen, which percolates up through the crust and sometimes
accumulates in underground traps. There might be enough natural
hydrogen to meet burgeoning global demand for thousands of years,
according to a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) model that was presented
in October 2022 at a meeting of the Geological Society of America"

But there might be more to mull over here.. A theologian once said
'every prophet worked as a shephard at least once in their
lives'.. I'd made a connection back then with them gaining people
management skills through the work (people are sheep), but this
pastoral people business brings in a new angle; were prophets
temperamentally pastoral but peaceful who wanted to be left alone by
the plundering farmer-slave state, then created a space for themselves
and like-minded others through a religious ideology?

---

There has been warrior monks in history so warrior shephard is not too
surprising.  I've seen a few of those guys I always thought they could
kick some ass.

If wages/inf is problematic, within this system there isn't much else
that can be done about it... For better results, need a better system.

---

Businesses work on credit, and credit is newly printed money which pay
salaries.. Only money in general circulaton can be inflationary. Ergo
reducing inf means reducing that circulation.
