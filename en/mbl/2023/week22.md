an Mou on Accelerating Development of Advanced Technologies and
Merging Mitsubishi Fuso and Hino Motors"

You dont need `cdist` from Sigh Pie; that code is a one-liner, works
even for vector -> matrix distances.

---

There; 3D interpolation via Quad Trees. It only depends on "Num Pie".

---

Interesting take from Al Monitor. They paint Burhan not in a strong
position, but Hemeti with access to resources he can buy loyalty with.

WSJ: "Company Insiders Made Billions Before SPAC Bust. Executives and
early investors sold shares worth $22 billion.. At their peak, SPACs
accounted for 70% of all IPOs. But now, the market has dried up and
shares of companies that did SPAC deals have crashed"

---

*Pompeii* was ok.. rivalry between Rome and Pompeii..? It was tough to
sell Keifer Sutherland as a goombah, but I think overall it
worked. Good guys - Celts, slave gladiators, citizens of Pompeii. Bad
guys - Romans. Lovely.

---

Simple algo; find closest points to new point in existing data,
compute distances to each, use that as weights to average their z
values.

---

"Sigh Pie" dependencies... Not usable on every platform. Major pain in
the neck. 3D interpolation should not require this much external code.

---

It wouldn't be as punishment for Darfur, or even the current crisis
that is displacing many.. Sudan is looking like a failed state but US
wld be more worried about a Red Sea Russian base.

---

Uh-oh.. George Clooney news segments are back in circulation, when he
was trying to "raise awareness on Darfur". Psyop in the works laying
the groundwork for a Sudan intervention?

---

South China Morning Post: "G7 countries have 'failed' to address
worldwide hunger, aid .. They can find untold billions to fight the
war [in Ukraine] but can't even provide half of what is needed by the
UN for the most critical humanitarian crises"

---

"England has the only privatised Water in Europe and the most water
pollution and most expensive water.

The UK has the only fully privatised energy, and the most expensive:

The UK has privatised rail, the slowest, least reliable and of course
most expensive in Europe"

---

A new inventive scheme could involve the government more, guiding the
printing towards more investments, and with a portion diverted to
direct payment to citizens.

---

Good points in the documentary *Debt Machine*; money is created out of
thin air for credit, it can be created for useful production instead
of speculation.

---

They cld probably design the engines as well, aren't the J-20 engines
built in-house? R&D cost must not have made economic sense.

Al Jazeera: "China’s first home-built passenger jet makes inaugural
flight.. The C919 commercial plane flew from Shanghai to Beijing as
China seeks to compete with Airbus and Boeing... C919 [..has] Western
components, including engines and avionics from firms such as General
Electric Co, Safran SA and Honeywell International Inc"

Xinhua: "[Iranian official] said images taken by Iranian satellites
have shown that the Taliban is storing the river's water behind its
dams, such as the Kamal Khan Dam, when Iran's southeastern Sistan and
Baluchestan province bordering Afghanistan was hit by drought.. He
urged the Taliban to respect Iran's water rights from the Helmand
River under a 1973 treaty between the two countries, which entitles
Iran to receive 820 million cubic meters of water from the river per
year.

He added that in addition to the dams built along the Helmand River in
the past, the Taliban has constructed new ones to 'prevent the river's
water from running into Iran.'. The Iranian Space Agency spokesman
said last week satellite photos showed that the Taliban have altered
the river's route in order to prevent it from reaching Iran"

---

WION: "Taliban, Iran exchange heavy gunfire on Afghan border; water
rights issue escalates"

---

Politico: "The White House has a simple message to Democrats skeptical
of the debt ceiling agreement the president cut with Speaker Kevin
McCarthy: Don’t judge us by what’s included but what we kept out...

Progressives have expressed frustration over new work requirements in
two government assistance programs — TANF and SNAP — along with the
spending caps"

---

WSJ: "Finally, Can We Ask Who Really Colluded With Russia? If the
crime is promoting distrust in institutions, the evidence is strongest
against the FBI and media"

---

Reuters: "Singapore’s Keppel Signs Deals to Ramp up Green Hydrogen,
Ammonia Output"

---

Doesn't automatically mean the movie is bad (as in Woke). If the
script is written well, it can work out \#TheFlash

---

*Meg 2*, *The Creator*, *Dune 2* trailers look great. Curious about
*The Flash*. They have a Superchica?

---

First Post: "Netflix' plan backfires, users start cancelling
subscriptions after password-sharing crackdown"

---

"Freedom of the Press Foundation will soon launch the “Daniel Ellsberg
Chair on Government Secrecy.” This full-time staff position will be
dedicated to what Ellsberg has spent a large portion of his life
highlighting the need for: massive reform of the secrecy
infrastructure in the United States. In the coming months, we’ll seek
funds to fully endow this chair position so that it can live in
perpetuity, and be free from changes in any fiscal or political
climate"

In the end, the vote is a referandum on the incumbent; voters
primarily vote on their well-being, pocketbook, and tend to reelect
the incumbent. The incumbency advantage should wear off as time goes
on but in tigger case IMO frequent "outside interventions" constantly
renewed the incumbency advantage for Tayyeap, the last one being in
2016 (likely attempted by fools partly egged on by gov itself but
anyway). Polls suggest the undecideds overwhelmingly went for the
incumbent in the eleventh hour, that suggest the incumbency advantage
persists.

---

Candidate-wise; the current Stanpoli mayor from the opposition could
fare a little better, but he made an ass of himself by associating
with elitist/neolib scum types near election prep, leaving himself
open to attacks - one came in the form of a court case that put his
candidacy in question.

---

TR opposition loses again but their PR work was better this time
around. Assuming the election was legit (some claim there is 2-3%
potential for gov to 'create' votes), they likely fell short on
immigration, and in the last stretch leaned on too heavily on
nationalism judging the third guy with 5% took that share because of
nat rhetoric. That was a mistake. Plus the anti-Russki narrative was
unnecessary, RU was already supportive of current gov, but the added
antagonism would not help, made opposition look like a undiplomatic
neophytes.

It looks like Putin provided direct aid in the form of natgas payments
for the election (residential natgas bill for entire month of May was
zero), and the grain deal renewal gave a PR win for the gov, announced
right after the first round.

---

Politico: "There is little to no accurate information about exactly
what chemicals are used in fracking, or how harmful they may be to
humans or the planet.. The heavy explosives used to create the holes
and fissures also create instability in the earth, leading to erosion
and even earthquakes, like the twelve 2011 earthquakes that rocked the
area around a fracking site in Youngstown, Ohio - a region that had
not ever experienced a quake since such activity was observed and
recorded, beginning in 1776"

---

The *real* Moby Dick story eh?

"The plot of *In the Heart of the Sea* is very reminiscent of *Moby
Dick*.. That said [the movie] is not officially inspired by or adapted
from Melville's *Moby Dick*. It is, however, adapted from another
book, Nathaniel Philbrick's *In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of
the Whaleship Essex*, originally published in 2000, which recounts the
true story of the Essex"

---

*In the Heart of the Sea* was a good movie. I hate to say it I found myself
rooting for the whale.

---

Likely due to us shitting into their environment, they are getting angry

NBC News: "Killer whale attacks on the rise, baffling researchers"

---

H2 Central: "While many carbon capture technologies target a 90-96%
capture rate, the 8RH2 oxy-combustion process will eliminate virtually
all direct CO2 emissions. Unlike standard hydrogen production, 8RH2
uses natural gas and pure oxygen and then utilizes the CO2 produced in
the combustion process as a heat transfer medium in a proprietary
reformer before sequestering the CO2. 8RH2‘s advanced process
eliminates the need for costly amine or cryogenic-based CO2 separation
processes that are normally required to capture CO2, as carbon
separation is inherent to the process itself"

---

"Work requirement" for federal help - sounds like more wage supression.

---

Another case of that population - growth bullshit; it is all about
letting more people in so they create competition for wages which
fall, bosses are happy, they contribute money to politicians who made
it happen.

---

On migration most in the US right-wing are two-faced; they say they
are against it, but actually want the cheap labor it provides for the
bosses who pay for them, so they secretly aim to allow it.

---

The Ethiopian dam GERD final capacity will be >6 GW. It's six nuclear
power plant equivalent. Not bad. 

---

South Sudan border, and the oil fields, the big ones were in the
south.

I remember one year '13 they finished a month early. like had so many
consecutive wins and enough points that even if they played no games
for weeks they'd still be the champion.
