CCJ: "Hitting the market in 2025, the recently announced Kenworth T680
FCEV is the culmination of seven years that Kenworth has been
collaborating with Toyota on prototype vehicles. It combines Toyota's
second generation hydrogen fuel cell stack with the T680 Next Gen. The
T680 FCEV is a Class 8 tractor rated up to 82,000 pounds and stores 60
kilograms of hydrogen on board that powers a 310 kilowatt motor and
it's 415 horsepower gives you all the power you need to do your
regional or long haul driving. The range is 450 miles and can refuel
it in 20 to 30 minutes.

Informed Comment: "[T]his country can no longer boast of having
anything like the world‚Äôs best educational outcomes, or healthcare
system, or the most advanced and safest infrastructure, or the best
democratic politics.. [but] Americans could certainly brag about one
thing this country has beyond compare: the most expensive military
around and possibly ever. No country even comes close to our
commitment of funds to wars, weapons.. and global dominance. Indeed,
the Pentagon‚Äôs budget for ‚Äúdefense‚Äù in 2023 exceeds that of the next
10 countries (mostly allies!) combined.

Illich: "Beyond a certain speed, motorized vehicles create remoteness
which they alone can shrink. They create distances for all and shrink
them for only a few. A new dirt road through the wilderness brings the

are well-wheeled away from a downtown that decays into a ghetto"

Firstpost: "NASA had initially planned to launch the Artemis 3 mission

pole. However, now, NASA believes that they may not be able to launch
the mission, essentially because of SpaceX..

SpaceX.. has secured the contract for the landing system, which is
based on a version of its Starship rocket prototype. This Starship
rocket, however, remains significantly distant from being fully
prepared. An orbital test flight of the Starship resulted in a
dramatic explosion in April... Jim Free.. expressed apprehension due
to the absence of actual launches. He emphasized that multiple
successful launches are required before the rocket can be considered
ready"

I bet on US side Dubya spurred that shit talked LatAm countries into
it, to "fight drugs". What a dildo.

cartels fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United

[[-]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_drug_war)

---

South of the US border when governments wanted to fight drug cartels,
they probably picked off the largest visible players, trying to end
oligapolies, monopolies.  But this is an area where you do **not**
want competition, a lively market, "better prices", "satisfied
customers" - you want an oligarchy, preferably a monopoly in the drug
business. Government then could reach a modus vivendi with that
player, one cartel supplies the much demanded product (no way around
that), hopefully keeping the price high, small fish do not fight
eachother for access, drug related crimes reduce.

bizarre, military is not officially in control but tries to manipulate

their shoulders constantly which makes them less of a politician. Same
for Thailand.. Even Egypt is better off.. Their military makes a coup,

The Walrus: "There Is No Housing Crisis.. Supply alone will not solve
a problem that large sections of the population don‚Äôt want to
fix.. Canada‚Äôs 'housing crisis' is a permanent state of affairs that
harms people in, or in need of, rental housing; roughly one-third of
the country‚Äôs households... Even 2020... was a good year for the
industry. Banks and other mortgage providers create money, lend it,
and charge interest on it. If that wasn‚Äôt already a sweet deal, the
federal government assumes a share of the risk of these mortgages..

A housing system that serves all but one group is not in a state of
crisis; it is one based on structural inequality and economic
exploitation... Why, then, are 'housing crisis' and 'supply-side'
arguments so prevalent?.. If we believe lack of supply is the cause of
lack of housing affordability, the solution is building
more... The.. argument serves a clear purpose: to sweeten the deal for
developers and landlords... 

There are many reasons for not treating housing as a market that
arrives at an optimal balance. The most important is that land, on
which housing is built, is a fixed resource. We cannot produce more of
it"

US individualism seems to be a carefully managed endeavor - you are
either guided towards a consumption domain where you "express" your
individuality, identity through the things you buy, or sometimes
-oddly enough- towards sects that are actually non-existent
sub-cultures, ethnic or otherwise, where you could be further
divided-and-ruled by the apparatus. A first generation
"Lithuanian-American" could say he is proudly Lithuanian, expressing a
differentiating factor about himself, an individuality when in fact
[culture code](../../0119/2014/06/the-culture-code.html#imprint) would suggest he
is no different from anyone else, heritage being meaningless.

Informed Comment: "Progressives Unveil OLIGARCH Act to Combat
‚ÄòExistential Threat‚Äô of Extreme Wealth Inequality.. A group of
progressive U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday proposed a wealth tax that
would automatically rise during periods of surging inequality and fall
once inequality moderates. The tax is at the heart of new legislation
called the Oppose Limitless Inequality Growth and Reverse Community
Harms (OLIGARCH) Act, which was introduced by Reps. Barbara Lee
(D-Calif.), Summer Lee (D-Pa.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Jamaal
Bowman (D-N.Y.)...

'Inequality in the United States is worse in 2023 than it was during
the Gilded Age,' Lee of California said in a statement. 'It is
unacceptable that millions of hardworking people remain impoverished,
while the top 0.1% hold over 20% of the nation‚Äôs wealth. The OLIGARCH
Act is the solution we need to close the exorbitant wealth gap in
America and create a tax system where everyone pays their fair share,'
she added. 'This level of wealth is not just a source of economic
injustice, but a major threat to democracy.'"
