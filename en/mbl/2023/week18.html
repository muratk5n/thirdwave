<p>Physics Today: "A water-splitting reactor, located in the parabolic
dish at its focal spot.. is solar powered and also.. generates
heat... The system collects and concentrates solar light with a
7-m-diameter parabolic dish (shown above and in a simplified schematic
below). Installed on the EPFL’s main campus, it tracks the Sun’s
movement across the sky. A steady stream of tap water is then sent to
the reactor’s electrolyzer subsystem, where it’s split with solar
energy to generate hydrogen. Before reaching the electrolyzer, the
water is heated as it passes through the solar reactor—specifically, a
light homogenizer, photovoltaic module, and light shield. The
researchers intentionally designed the system to generate heat, which
not only accelerates the water-splitting reaction but also can be used
for warming water and other elements.</p>

<p>Reddit User: "[Answering question 'Why is water see through?'] It's a
little bit backwards. Life needed to be able to see through water, so
it created eyes that could see the light that water was clear to.</p>
<p>That might need some explanation. All things are "clear" to some kinds
of light and "opaque" to other light. Like how an X ray can go right
through your skin and see your bones. It's that way for all light,
including visible light.</p>
<p>So there was always some wavelength of light that made water
"clear". And some of those wavelengths are the visible light spectrum.</p>
<p>So when life evolved in the ocean, and eyes developed, it was very
useful to be able to see the light that could pass through the
water. And so you get eyes that can see in the ocean"</p>

their parrot capabilities. That's it. The tech is as parroty as it
was, but now, it can generate better spam. It still can't drive a car
or summarize a text. And it won't get there as long as maintream
remains on this misguided path. They will try bigger "better" neural
nets that will go nowhere just like some physicists want to keep
building bigger and better colliders instead of going back to the
