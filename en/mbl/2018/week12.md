# Week 12

Should there be no privatization?

I did not say that

I am not for government running companies. But u have to draw a line somewhere, protect the public from excessive privatization. Ever since 1989 things got out of hand.

Question

Why would a farmer like capitalism?

They want a good price for their crops

But then when things go wrong, they also want to be bailed out (we are needed to feed people, we are too important to fail). I guess their bad habits still persist in the financial class today.

Question

Is finance related to farming?

Yes

First futures contract was for rice trading in the Far East.

Question

Worst examples of trampling of public sphere in any country?

Go to Goatfucker HQ

Farming started around Hilly Flanks, so this region even today suffers
from an absence of public sphere. Go to the "richest" area in
Istanbul, and look at the sidewalks, how narrow they are. This only
happens when property owners extends their sphere by any means, at the
expense of the public.

The Gezi protest in TR, BTW, were not primarly about protecting the
greenery. It was about protecting one of the few remaining public
spaces in that area.

Question

But isn't the Jesus myth still weird?... Having no father all that...?

No

Farmers, villagers at the time were praying to bones, let's not
forget, to their "ancient ones" (bcz inheriting land is
all-important). "The man without a father" in this age is great sales
pitch - whether created by divine intervention, or a smart politician.
