<p>That is absolutely true.. An incremental change in a largely useless
direction. Perfect example of 'getting stuck at local maxima'. The
one-step change marketed to office-dwelling limpdicks who "like"
electricity (they can see the wall plug at home/work, it looks
sterile, 'clean', 'magical' unlike fuels which are mostly, like, ew).
The sale was done on the basis of "we'll make that magical thing
'green' for you by taking your cool laptop's battery and put it on the
car".  Despite appearances office dwelling limpdicks were too
uninformed or too fucking dumb to realize such approach could not
scale. That behind the magic there would be even <a href="../../2021/10/the-rare-metals-war.html">more
pollution</a>.</p>
<p>"Battery-electric tech is the Obamacare of green energy"</p>
<hr />
<p>Obviously the implication below is people are half idiots, and that is
mostly true. But more than that, they are just busy. They have other
things to worry about, jobs, family, which take time. Politics,
statecraft is a profession. Just like we cant form an in-depth opinion
on a root canal and replace the dentist by 'media', cant do the same
for statecraft. People vote on their well-being, on the incumbent,
based on a few (three) general parameters which is enough for
democracy. The rest is rationalizations to sound cool around the
water-cooler for a decision that was already made on a much baser
level. This analysis is offputting for some, further away than a
Renaissance society they might have dreamt about but it's life. The
sights and people we saw on Jaywalking are not the exception, or even
an American phenomenon, they are the rule.</p>

<p>Issue polls don't matter much.. People voting for representatives who

be fixed among representatives themselves (if changed they'll sell the
new position to the public who will follow, repeat the justifications
fed to them by the media), and that can only happen if the issue is
hot-button issue no more. Dems messed this up, they need to fix it.</p>

<p>Israel and the Arab states were establishing relations, the killing of
the journalist complicates that, which could be the reason why it was
done. Thawing of relations could help the Palestine cause, maybe at
some point 'the new neighbors' would push for a Palestian state?  We
can't have that!</p>
<hr />
<p>That's the other thing; people are locked up in a prison-like system
behind walls, <em>but</em> Israel needs workers, so people go through
checkpoints daily to work in Israel. Got walls, but we need workers,
and oh, also, we want to settle behind that wall, inside settlements
which themselves need their own walls. The situation is obnoxiously
stupid. I think deep down Israelis believe Palestenians will just
disappear somehow and they'll have the land all for themselves.</p>
<p>If Palestine had a stand-up comedy culture, its comedians would never
go without work. There is a wealth of material out there.</p>
<hr />
<p>Jenin, the place where that poor female journalist was killed
recently, is in northern West Bank. Jenin is obviously behind the
wall, but still under military occupation. Extremely low income,
workers from there have to pass through checkpoints, with permits, to
enter Israel to work.</p>
<hr />
<p>Gaza and the West Bank are both surrounded by walls, yet there is a
military occupation in the West Bank. One would think the walls would
create a de-facto Palestian state already. Egypt takes Gaza, West Bank
could declare statehood, w East Jerusalem as the capital. But the
settlements make that route impossible. Israel wants to have its cake
and eat it too. Isolate people behind walls, but then settle in their
land, that's where the need for 'extra protection' comes from.</p>

<p>This is not some Zen koan or ancient parable. It comes from
mathematical optimization. Optimizing algorithms look for global
minima (or maxima) all the time, and they always try not to get stuck
at "local solutions". </p>
<hr />
<p>In that case climb down, apply same technique in a different
direction, or try to see two steps ahead if possible; that means have a
two-step plan instead of just one.</p>
<hr />
<p>The one-step vs two-step solution issue is related to small,
incremental wins. Imagine being outside, during a fog, night time, how
to reach the top of a highest near hill? Simple solution - always move
in the uphill direction. Works remarkably well. Even if we lose long
distance vision, improving the current situation builds up in the
long-run, leads to global solution.</p>
<p>But, one can still get stuck on a "local minima". Because we didn't
look ahead, could have climbed the nearest <em>shorter</em> hill. The fog clears

<p>Business Insider: "[2/2022] At the tactical level, Russia's
non-contact warfare doctrine seeks to leverage drone spotters and
electronic warfare to locate enemy forces for destruction at standoff
distances using artillery without exposing tanks and infantry to
direct fire until the opposition is shattered"</p>

<p>"Kidnappings. Outbreaks. Earthquakes. The president assassinated —
this time in his bedroom. How is it possible, many ask, that Haiti
shares an island with the Dominican Republic, with its underground
subway system, health care coverage, public schools, teeming resorts
and impressive stretches of economic growth? Corruption is the usual
explanation..</p>
<p>[I]f Haiti had not been forced to pay its former slave masters, one
team of international scholars recently estimated, the country’s per
capita income in 2018 could have been almost six times as large —
about the same as in its next-door neighbor, the Dominican
Republic.They called the burden imposed on Haiti “perhaps the single
most odious sovereign debt in history.'"</p>

<p>The 'gun problem' cannot be fixed by simply harping about gun control.
'Guns are killing people, fix guns'. Nope. Centrist Dems starting
during the 90s created a culture war around this issue, so one-step
solution will meet intense objection. But if all parties are
ideologically distinct, seperate and secure in their seperation
(dividers not uniters) then 5G issues will find easier agreement. We
know this can happen because it happened before; Reagan was for gun
control. Nixon founded the EPA. Two steps; fix ideology first, gun
agreement later.</p>
<hr />
<p>The world is sufficiently fucked that one-step solution are no more
enough to fix problems. We cant fix the 'green energy problem' by
simply producing 'green electricity'. What will come after? How do you
transmit the energy? 'Well we just extend existing transmission lines'
(suboptimal). So the one step taken to make electricity 'green'
fails. Two-steps was needed not just one. First step; the energy
transmission mechanism changes, becomes gas based. Second step; Green
energy is produced, converted into green gas, using the new
transmission.</p>

<p>Paper: "The performance of high-yield bonds in the US domestic market
mirrors economic performance in the US overall. The yield spread of
high-yield debt over investment grade corporate bonds is more of a
function of the general outlook of the economy than of the health of
the issuing companies themselves, although the latter is obviously
important"</p>

<p>"Luna and UST had a combined market value of almost 60 billion

<p>"Norway and Finland have similar levels of gun ownership, but far less
gun crime"</p>

<p>Sure this whole thing will be solved in a jif by skillful Twitter
put-downs. #Guns</p>

<p>That won't happen; at worst their military takes over, as they've done
many times before, and they run the country along with its nukes.
Obviously a coup would be bad.</p>
