<p>Further good news from the parliament today is the return of the
additionality principle to legal regulation, rather than delegating
this to the European Commission via the Delegated Act of RED II. This
will ease the implementation of the additionality principle for
renewable hydrogen. MEPs have listened to the sector‚Äôs concerns that
overly strict regulations would hinder the development of this crucial
market. Hydrogen Europe fully recognises the importance, and supports,
the principle of additionality but has expressed concerns regarding
the practical implementation of the proposed criteria, not the
principle itself. The task at hand is to find a balance between
ensuring green hydrogen is produced from new renewable energy capacity
and avoiding excessive constraints on a nascent market"</p>

<p>"First hydrogen trains in India to be powered by Ballard fuel cell
modules.. Indian Railways has contracted a leading rail system
integrator for the development of Hydrogen trains"</p>
<hr />
<p>But people like Feinst supported Iraq War at first (which partly gave
rise to torture, or more torture), some found new religion later on
admitting they were duped, would've been better not to have gone in in
the first place.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>The Report</em>, movie abt the systemic US torture post 9/11. Lays out
the events without being boring.. A. Driver, Hamm, Benning were good
in it. D. Feinstein in real life did something positive after all...</p>
<hr />
<p>It is baller Abramovic getting salty with a journo, he asks "are you
cameraman or journalist", guy says "journalist", then Abram says "then
why are you holding the camera?". Boom. Thug life.</p>
<hr />
<p>That's it, that's the one. </p>

<p>A meme is called for here: thug life. After a take down, people would
create animations dropping shades, hat, and a cig on someone's head
and it would say "thug life" if we remember. Perfect fit here. The
crown is already gangsta no need for hat (stolen property, by an
empire responsible for millions of deaths), just drop shades and a
cig.</p>
<hr />
<p>With Koh-i-Noor Camilla will be like "it took me over 30 years but I
got here, I got jewels". Total gangsta. Imma get that crown with the
mammoth rock on it... Hell yea</p>

<p>NYT: "[2016] The Indian government has begun a campaign for the return
of a historic 105.6-carat diamond.. For many Indians, the Koh-i-Noor ‚Äî
or Mountain of Light ‚Äî is a symbol of colonial subjugation and three
centuries of exploitation that began with the East India Company in
the early 17th century"</p>
