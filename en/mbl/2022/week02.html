<p>Li battery tech is shockingly bad for the needs of a green
future. Lithium reserves are limited, can only handle 5% of world
storage needs. Fast charging on par with chemically refueling is a
pipe dream, the best they can do is half an hour, which, when applied
degrades the battery increasing the chance of a blowup (when these
f-ing things burn BTW, fire fighters cannot put out the fire with
regular methods). Batteries degrade even with regular charging (see
below) after 3500 cycles they go down to 70% capacity (imagine the
effects of that on a second-hand market for BEVs). Batteries are
heavy, impractical for transportation of energy.  Batteries rely on
rare-earth materials, for which we need to destroy Chile, Bolivia to
get. From a systemic, TCO viewpoint the tech is a complete junk.</p>

individuals and businesses... The proposal, now laid out in separate
pieces of legislation, faces significant hurdles in the coming
months.. “There are countless studies that tell us a single-payer
healthcare system is the fiscally sound thing to do, the smarter
healthcare policy to follow, and a moral imperative if we care about
human life,” Assemblyman Ash Kalra (D-San Jose), the proposal’s
author, said Thursday"</p>

<p>Yann is so full of shit. With his approach, deep neural networks what
came to be called "AI" today, that is <em>exactly</em> what they are
doing. If not in the tiniest detail, certainly in spirit, in the
overall approach to the problem. Implicitly they believe what's known
about the human brain so far is final, X number of neurons are there,
they somehow "connect" and do stuff together, so if we start from tiny
particles (software neurons) and build up in code, we will reach human
level intelligence. This is the belief -- yet no cigar. A decade ago
they could be forgiven bcz the hardware "wasn't there yet". Now it
is. Where is Artif. General Intelligence?</p>
<p>NN Expert Yann LeCun: "The cargo cult approach to aeronautics—for
actually building airplanes—would be to copy birds very, very closely;
feathers, flapping wings, and all the rest. And people did this back

in AI is to try to copy every detail that we know of about how neurons
and synapses work, and then turn on a gigantic simulation of a large
neural network inside a supercomputer, and hope that AI will
emerge. That’s cargo cult AI"</p>

<p>Obviously LPG needs to go (away). Use natgas -&gt; H2 and produce "blue
H2". Use that in cars. If CCS at the source is done well (easy to
regulate) then the car can have no emissions. Use of renewable fuel at
the endpoint assures noone can cheat the way Volkswagen cheated with
diesel.</p>
<p>US EPA: "Nearly all of the fuel carbon (99.5 percent) in LPG is
converted to CO2 during the combustion process. This conversion is
relatively independent of firing configuration"</p>

<hr />
<p>LPG is part buthane, part propane, both are products of natural gas.
As natgas became more prevalent such use of LPG must have become
feasible back when. I vaguely remember that transition, first noone
had natgas, then some for heating, then it was everywhere. It probably
helped to be the next door neighbor to the natgas export behemoth,
Russia, for TR. Import graph below.</p>

<p>Hah they use LPG in their cars too, same with many cars, esp cabbies
in Asia Minor. They used to put a freaking kitchen gas canister in
there, in the trunk during the 90s and jury-rig the engine to combust
LPG instead of petroleum (cheaper that way). To refuel, take old
canister, put another in. But the tech has developed now, cars can go
to a station and pump the gas in just like one does with petroleum.</p>
<p>"[Kazakhtan protests] began with something very concrete: the price of
liquified petroleum gas, or LPG, the fuel that many use to power their
cars. What caused the spike in LPG prices? It all began with the
phased transition to ..  allow the market to dictate prices instead
[of subsidies]... This policy has, predictably enough, led to a
particularly precipitous rise in costs where demand for this fuel is
high"</p>

<p>"Macron has provoked outcries ..  by using .. the French word
'emmerder,' rooted in the French word for 'crap' and meaning to rile
or to bug [the unvaccinated]"</p>
<hr />
<p>Macron is trending with over 300K tweets, wow</p>

<p>Ranked choice voting vs two-round system: With TRS candidates in the
1st round would only be interested in getting more votes than the next
guy. If 10 people are running and 8 ppl get less than 10%, but one
person gets 12%, and the next best gets 11%, they are both in the next
round.</p>
<p>In such a setting candidates can choose appeal to very narrow
constituencies, and still win, then of course in the next round they'd
have to change their tune to appeal to more..  With RCV they'd have to
appeal to the broadest possible electorate from get-go, imo that is a
good thing. Plus rcv is a money saver.</p>

<p>The <em>Foundation</em> series.. It was excellent. The arc for the Cleons was
something to watch.. Brilliant! Seldon actor choice was perfect.</p>

<p>Median is used instead of arithmetic mean precisely to ward off the
effect of extremes. It is used for wealth averages for the same
reason; otherwise people like Bezos would throw everything off. Joe,
Bob are in a room, they have 100,102 dollars, Bezos walks in to the
room, everyone there is now a billionaire, on average. Median sorts
the list and literally picks the person in the middle, in this case
the median wealth is $102. For home prices, that median is almost half
a <em>f-ing</em> million dollars.</p>
<hr />
<p>The median home price itself is nearly half a million dollars
BTW.. For four walls and a roof.. There are amenities in it sure,
but nearly <em>half a million dollars worth</em>?</p>

<p>I remember some "boomer comedy" a while back complaining their kid
still has not left the house, still lives with them. Why not? Well
maybe bcz housing prices are too high. Prev generation outsourced,
killed wage growth, killed rates, and stock and real-estate prices
became inflated.. Now their kids dont believe in capitalism, who can
blame them?</p>
<hr />
<p>0% instead of 2% mortage can offset a 30% rise of cost of a home in 15
years. But the price rise we see for homes for that period is over
60%, due to speculation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Low rates can help mortgage rates be lower, but low irates also create
a speculative environment whereby investors rush to real estate assets
inflating prices there, which wld erase any gains home buyers might
have enjoyed due to low rates. Wasn't this at the root of the 2007/8
crisis? They were giving mortages to dead people for effs sake.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reverse correlation is visible. We see the brief 2018 rise in rates,
and housing prices falling.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another reason why low interest rates are bad, it inflates house prices.
