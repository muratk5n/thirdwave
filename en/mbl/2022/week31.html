plans.. [for] an industrial-scale biomass to green ammonia
facility. The global production capacity of grey ammonia is expected
to expand from around 235 million metric tons in 2019, to nearly 290

ammonia production will need to transition to a low-carbon ‘green’

starting capacity of 100,000 tonnes of green ammonia positioning
itself as a leader in the burgeoning low-carbon ammonia sector."</p>

can be made from sand, or from crushed-up recycled solar panels and
electronics. EAT's process results in a porous silicon powder that's
completely safe and easy to transport...</p>
<p>When you need the hydrogen, you dump the Si+ powder into water, mix it
around a bit, and ... that's pretty much it. At a wide range of
ambient temperatures between 0-80 °C (32-176 °F), hydrogen gas will
start bubbling out. The chemical equation, says EAT, looks like this:
Si + 2H2O -&gt; SiO2 + 2H2. Thus, apart from the hydrogen gas, all that's
left over is silicon dioxide, also known as silica, or the major
constituent of sand"</p>

<p>The Lighthouse: "Designer bacteria could fuel the future with cheap
hydrogen.. Macquarie synthetic biologists have made a breakthrough in
renewable energy production by creating genetically-engineered
sugar-loving bacteria that can produce on-demand, zero-emission
hydrogen fuel..</p>
<p>The genetic engineering of the microbes is partly funded by a $1.1
million grant from the Australian Government’s Renewable Energy Agency
(ARENA) and supported by industry partners BOC Australia and
Bioplatforms Australia.</p>
<p>'This is renewable energy that uses a two-part system; first, the
bacteria consume the sugar and as it digests the sugar it produces the
hydrogen gas,' [researcher] explains...</p>
<p>Farming bacteria to produce hydrogen also has economic and
environmental advantages – in the right setting, bacteria rapidly
multiply, they are cheap to create and don’t need much space...</p>
<p>The University team has used genetic engineering approaches to change
the DNA of certain strains of E. coli bacteria to produce hydrogen
from sugars.</p>
<p>By accelerating the metabolism of the bacteria and finding the optimum
conditions for production, they have produced a strain that makes
hydrogen at rates higher than any previous published rates of
bacterial bio-hydrogen.</p>
<p>Many bio-hydrogen developers are using algae to produce hydrogen but
Willows says that bacteria have the advantage of much faster
production and lower inputs – they also don’t require big ponds for
cultivation.</p>
<p>The strain that the team has developed is also very stable, he
adds. 'We have bacteria that we made more than four months ago that
are still producing hydrogen at the same rate,” he says. “They are not
growing or dividing – this is exciting as all of the enzymes that are
required within the bacterial cell seem to be stable for about three
or four months, or possibly longer.'</p>

Macquarie’s bacterial hydrogen producers can keep brewing gas without

<p>CNBC: "Air travel chaos.. [We] spoke to several pilots flying for
major airlines, all of whom described fatigue due to long hours and
what they said was opportunism and a desire to cut costs as part of a
toxic 'race to the bottom' culture pervading the industry and
worsening the messy situation that travelers are facing today...</p>
<p>'Leading into the summer, it was absolute carnage because airlines
didn’t know what they were doing. They didn’t have a proper plan in
place. All they knew they wanted to do was try and fly as much as
humanly possible – almost as if the pandemic had never happened,' [a]
pilot said.</p>
<p>'But they forgot that they’d cut all of their resources.'"</p>

<p>Peter Voit (Not Even Wrong Blog): "There’s a new book out this month,
'Before the Big Bang: The Origin off the Universe from the Multiverse'..</p>
<p>I spent a few minutes today looking through the book in the bookstore,
trying to figure out where to find the details of the 'spectacularly
vindicated with observational evidence.' I didn’t see any references
in the book..  For many years I’ve spent a significant amount of time
reading books and papers purporting to offer scientific evidence for a
multiverse, trying to carefully understand the author’s arguments and
write about them here.. Few physicists though seem to care that bogus
claims and pseudo-science about the multiverse have overrun their
field and become its public face. I’ve come to the conclusion that
best to not waste more time on this"</p>

<p>RU reorg of its mil worked for them.. they saw major US air power in
display in Desert Storm, and in later conflicts, saw units that can
communicate effectively, be deployed anywhere... How do you fight
that? Disrupt communications through major jamming capab, develop
strong air defense, and center it around the type of war <em>they</em> would
fight - against a neighbor, mostly on land. Tactics feed into tanks
and artillery, even snipers pass intel to them, air defense protects
them, and they attack with overwhelming force, not with the precision
of US military, but still through sheer numbers it is effective.</p>

<p>It wont; RU can still hit transport with anti-ship missiles in Crimea,
and Kherson. See <a href="twimg/FY5ZWQKWIAE2LD_.jpg">here</a>.</p>

<p>Davis: "Ukraine’s Big ‘Million Man’ Offensive Against Russia Is A
Mistake... As someone who has fought in large tank battles and spent
years participating in large-scale mechanized war games in Europe, I
cannot stress how difficult a task it is for an army to mount an
offensive operation when it has lost a sizeable portion of its
experienced leaders, is filled with large numbers of raw recruits, and
have a patchwork of limited armored vehicles and ammunition...</p>
<p>The danger in shooting for a miracle and trying the offensive anyway
is that Ukraine would risk suffering even more casualties, losing more
irreplaceable equipment, and in the end potentially suffering the loss
of even more territory than they had at the beginning of the
battle. All Russia would have to do is absorb the blows, yield only
when required to avoid encirclement, and then when the Ukrainian side
had expended its striking power, launch a counter-offensive to drive
the weakened troops further west"</p>
