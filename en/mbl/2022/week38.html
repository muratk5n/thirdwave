<p>There - we see a turbulent area but it is localized and there is a

<hr />
<p>Turbulence, randomness.. how was randomness used? Calculating detailed
aero (to see all details of turbulence) is costly. With usual methods
one represents turbulence statistically, allowing controlled
randomness in the model, eg one says "I'll treat turbulent parts as a
blob, I dont care about the internal details of that blob but I'll
keep track of its location, maybe its size"... That could improve
calculations, turb is roughly accounted for, no need to process it in
detail, the rest of the computation in non-turbulent areas benefit
too.</p>
