<p>Davis: "Ukraine Got Its Miracle In Taking Kherson Without A Fight (But
Winter Is Coming).. By surrendering Kherson city without a fight and
blowing the bridges over the Dnipro, [RU General] Surovikin has
preserved 30,000 of his best-trained and experienced troops for use in
the coming offensive, sealed off the southern front from a risk of a
Ukrainian flanking action and will soon have a massive new force to
employ...</p>
<p>Once this force is ready to launch Putin’s winter offensive (likely in
late December/early January when the ground has sufficiently frozen),
it will likely be preceded by a massive new attack on the Ukrainian
energy infrastructure to plunge the country into darkness, cripple the
remainder of its electrified rail system, and significantly hamper the
government’s ability to supply its troops with basic needs"</p>

the first edition of this book was completed in late 1990... In the
year and a half since this book was written, the evidence against the
Big Bang has grown stronger, and the COBE results, far from 'proving'
the theory, have not in any way resolved the problems raised by other
discoveries. The key problem.. is that there are objects in the
universe— huge conglomerations of galaxies—that are simply too big to
have formed in the time since the Big Bang, objects whose age is
greater than the age Big Bang cosmologists assign to the universe
itself"</p>
