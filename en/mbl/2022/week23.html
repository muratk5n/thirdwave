<hr />
<p>VW now likes battery-electric cars, these people clearly alternate
between being a crook and a moron; but the energy infra should not
give them a chance to be either. Clean molecules in storage,
tranmission, and consumption can achieve that.</p>
<hr />
<p>The longer fossil stays in the system, stored, transmitted, the more
the chances are for "leaking or cheating". If oil pipeline breaks it
causes environmental damage. If dirty fuels are allowed in cars with
'emission control' instituted, it will lead to cheating as in
Volkswagen's case.</p>
<hr />
<p>They can have their cake and eat it. Generate 'blue' H2 and pipeline
it to customers. Clean, after CCS at the source can have no emissions
down the line, including the end-user. </p>

countries should be able to exploit their vast natural gas reserves

former UN climate envoy Mary Robinson has said"</p>

<p>Blue steel was the other thing 🤣 #zoolander</p>
<hr />
<p>I like the name; GREEN STEEL</p>
<p>H2 Green Steel: "Steel production accounts for 25 percent of Europe’s
industrial CO2 emissions, which is more than the Nordics’ total CO2
emissions, or more than all flights departing from the
EU. Decarbonization is a must for the industry and disruptive
technology will be a key enabler..</p>
<p>So, how does it all work? In traditional steel making, reduction of
iron ore is done by heating it together with coal, utilizing a
chemical reaction that separates the oxygen from the iron, forming and
emitting CO2. In our production, green hydrogen reacts with iron ore
similarly to carbon, resulting in the extraction of oxygen. But
instead of creating CO2, the main by-product is H2O.</p>
<p>Large-scale green hydrogen production will enable the transition of
hard-to-abate industries towards sustainable operations. And as a
front-runner, H2 Green Steel will play an important part in
accelerating decarbonization"</p>

<p>Couldn't Ukraine/West cut them in? Russia I mean; somehow make them
part of the process, so they would have less of an incentive to
invade?</p>

<p>That translates to approx 12 gboe (gigabarrels of oil equivalent),
about one tenth of largest known oil field. Not bad. That'll push a
man to invade combined with all other insecurities building up at
those borders.</p>
<p>Wiki: "The Yuzivska gas field is a Ukrainian natural gas field that
was discovered in 2010. It was expected to begin production in 2017,
but development was halted because of the outbreak of the 2014 war in
the Donbas region. The total proven reserves of the Yuzivska gas field
are around 70.8 trillion cubic feet"</p>

<p>"The Russian sniper is a specially selected and skilled soldier
who.. is part of the target acquisition system... Objectives of a
sniper team during en masse employments are to hinder or channelize
movement of tactical formations and then direct artillery fire on
prioritized targets...</p>
<p>In Russian Military culture, artillery is called the 'God of War.'
Whereas U.S. forces rely on artillery to support maneuver, the
Russians take the opposite approach: maneuver supports artillery.
Artillery is the decisive finishing arm for the Russian Army..</p>
<p>The employment of UAS by Russian Forces adds another dimension to
their fires capability.  In Eastern Ukraine, Russian Forces have
demonstrated their ability to direct and adjust fires with their
drones. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly seen a systematic approach by
the Russians to acquire a target with a UAS. A high level UAS will
identify a Ukrainian target. It will then pass off that target to
another lower level UAS to determine the target coordinates. Then the
Russians will adjust their fire with the UAS based on the initial
artillery strikes. The total time for this process can be as little as
10-15 minutes...</p>
<p>One thing noticeably absent from Russian UAS employment is the kind of
surgical drone strike that the U.S. has used to great effect in the
past 15 years. Russia does not currently possess a weaponized UAS
similar to a Predator"</p>

<p>"NATO-trained" (as opposed to being NATO) actually might have worked
against Ukraine. NATO likely trained them as it trains itself, to be
able to integrate indiv country's forces so they can fight
together. That can make u lax; They did not think an integrated mil
solution. Per execution, everyday dynamics UKR is on its own in the
war against Russia, not part of any other organization.</p>
