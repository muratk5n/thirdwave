<p>Electrification goal: another dumb try. There isn't enough lithium in
the world. The electric grid is inefficient and will always be so; the

<hr />
<p>A lot about US is about "dumb tries". You win by trying a lot, and
hopefully 'striking gold'. That approach might be reaching the end of
its usefulness. The culture likely formed while exploring the "new
lands", all you needed was courage, a push, enough for you to start
the journey, the rest would be adventure and hopefully a lot of gains.</p>
<p>But tinkering with a dangerous virus gave us covid. Stupid courage can
push you to Mars, but will also kill you there. Crossing the Atlantic
to reach new lands was different type of experimentation.. There was
still land, air, the downside for failure actually wasn't too high.</p>

<p>Nationalists gaslight. Asia Minor relation to the seas could simply be
explained by looking at the other nations in the area, but no...  We
have to come up with some bed time story about a "migrant" who is
"new" and "different" to the area because such narrative -at one
point- was useful (it isn't even useful anymore, on top of being a
blatant lie).</p>
<hr />
<p>Romans were always a land-centric force, they saw the sea as a way to
transport land troops for subsequent land invasion. When they used the
sea they tried to invent mechanisms to merely complement their land
strength, sometimes in bizarre ways. One invention was a huge landing
platform bolted in the middle of the ship, plan was to pull it down
during ship-to-ship conflict on top of the other ship so regular
legionaires can rush over there and do legionaire shit.. But the
mechanism wasn't designed well it screwed up the balance of the ships,
they routinely sank.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was one Greek ship in the 1900s Georgios Averof that caused huge
damage on the entire Otto navy, allowing Greeks to take more Aegean
islands. That wasn't because Greeks "like the sea more", that ship
used British guns and French boilers. Ship was made in Italy but Italy
too had fallen behind in its sea control comparatively speaking. So
much so that when Hitler made an alliance with fascist Italy the
alliance wasn't seen to have brought more reach for either of them; a
land power allied with another land power.</p>

<p>Politico: "Germany gets tough on Brexit.. New German Chancellor Olaf
Scholz has Boris Johnson firmly in his sights.. German officials say
there is cross-party consensus in Germany on the need to protect the
EU single market — the destination of about 70 percent of German
exports — but acknowledged Berlin has dialled up the rhetoric in
recent weeks.. Berlin has also judged this is the appropriate time to
send a 'blunter' message that the U.K. must abandon any ambitions to
rewrite the protocol, they added. Germany also wants to dispel any
suggestion that the row is merely an issue between the U.K. and
Ireland only"</p>

<p>There is also that pile of cash the US froze; bondholders can ask US
to be paid from that stash.</p>
<p>CNBC: "Russia has entered its first major foreign debt default for
over a century, after a grace period on two international bond
payments lapsed on Sunday night... The Kremlin has rejected the claim
that Russia is in default..  telling a press call this morning that
Russia made the bond payments due in May but they have been blocked by
Euroclear due to Western sanctions, rendering the non-delivery of
payments 'not [Russia’s] problem.'"</p>

<p>UKR did not implement Minsk agreements, and sent bombing sorties
toward Russian seperatists with those little toy planes from
"Britain's other bitch" assuming an offensive posture.. All with the
support of US/UK. You poked the bear and now the bear is coming for
you. What were they thinking?</p>
<hr />
<p>"Support Ukraine" rhetoric is also partly there to cover up previous
fuck ups of the West, especially of Britain and US. If we treat UKR
gov as good capable leaders only lacking some weapons under the attack
of a mean Russia, then their mistakes get erased, forgotten</p>

Russia's invasion have been shocked by the brutality of the war and

<p>The Guardian: "Even today, there is some dissension in the west about
what the objectives in Ukraine should be. In contrast to the leaders
of the Baltic states, Poland, and the United Kingdom, the French
president, Emmanuel Macron, and German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, are
not committed to ensuring that Russia is defeated militarily, and the
Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has proposed a peace framework,
with an immediate ceasefire at the top of the agenda"</p>

<hr />
<p>Foreign Policy: "[Gabbard, Davis] As much as Ukraine welcomes every
piece of equipment, however, the deliveries have been a clunky mixture
of modern and antiquated, Western and Soviet. Numerous systems require
specialized training, specific maintenance systems, and ammunition of
various calibers that are often mutually exclusive to each weapon
system. All of this requires a massive and complicated logistics
system to keep the weapons supplied and functioning—one that doesn’t
currently exist in Ukraine and continues to be improvised...</p>
<p>Policies in Kyiv and Washington seem to ignore these battlefield
realities... While there is still time, and Kyiv still controls 80
percent of its territory, a change in U.S. policy would provide a
chance to save Ukrainian lives and prevent further territorial
losses. At minimum, the Biden administration should de-emphasize
its goals of weakening Russia and instead prioritize diplomacy,
helping Kyiv and Moscow find a negotiated end to the war"</p>

hydrogen roadmap, outlining a set of recommendations for government

of green hydrogen from Australia to Germany.</p>

<p>TDB: "And yet, even with the challenge of pandemic recovery, we are
not facing 'stagflation,' a word that ruled our economic lives 40
years ago and now is a term that I have to explain to my younger
students. Stagflation was something that once seemed impossible: high
inflation, low growth, and high unemployment all at the same
time. This happened in the 1970s, but it isn’t happening now—or at
least, it isn’t happening yet—and it’s one reason treating 2022 as if
it’s 1979 doesn’t make much sense.Let’s also admit an obvious
political reality about the expectations of the American voter: Many
of the people who are fed up with inflation in 2022 are angry mostly
because until about a year ago, they’d never actually experienced
it. Yes, it’s been a rough year, but in 1979 Americans were despairing
because high inflation had already been around for several
years. Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Carter all tussled with it. We
tried everything from wage and price controls to 'Whip inflation now'
sloganeering—as if consumers could join the fight by wearing
buttons.The same is true of interest rates. Today’s younger consumers
may be shocked that mortgages are breaking 6 percent—but again, this
is because they have become accustomed to ridiculously low rates. Even
50 years ago, the average rates were about 7 percent; they’ve been
lower than that for two decades now"</p>

<p>German libertarians supported ending the ban - because of, you know,
liberty.</p>
<p>NYT: "Germany Ends Ban on Abortion Advertisement.. The vote to scrap
the law came on the same day that Roe v. Wade was overturned by the
U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Lawmakers voted on Friday to end a Nazi-era ban on the advertisement
of abortion services, a measure that had effectively criminalized
doctors who provided information about the procedure.The law, though
ignored for years, had recently prompted several high-profile legal
cases against doctors. That, in turn, led to a sustained campaign by
abortion-rights activists for repeal of the advertising ban, which
Germany’s relatively new government had made a goal"</p>

<p>Washington Examier: "After a month of holding out, the Ukrainian high
command ordered the remaining defenders in Severodonetsk, the
administrative capital of Luhansk, to beat a tactical retreat out of
the city and fortify their defenses in Lysychansk, the sister city to
the west of the Seversky Donets River. 'Remaining in positions smashed
to pieces over many months just for the sake of staying there does not
make sense,' Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said...</p>
<p>Russian forces were making slow progress in the Severodonetsk pocket
for weeks, using their advantage in artillery to pummel everything in
their path before sending ground forces into the area. Russia’s war
plan, to put it in the most unsophisticated way possible, was to
overwhelm the Ukrainian defenders with constant bombardment until they
relented. For Ukraine, the only other alternative would have been to
stick around and risk total encirclement — a strategy that would have
been indefensible, if not insane, when the Ukrainian military is
already losing perhaps 200 soldiers a day"</p>
