would quickly find themselves going from very deep to shallow water.
'They rely on their echolocation and yet it doesn't tell them that
they are running out of water.. They come closer and closer to shore
and become disoriented. The tide can then drop from below them and
before they know it, they're stranded on the beach.'"</p>

<p>Economist Steve Keen: "[In his research] Bernanke was relying on the
mainstream theory that banks simply act as intermediaries between
savers and borrowers—the ideas for which his.. Prize companions
Diamond and Dybvig received their share of the Bank of Sweden's loot
this year (the prize was created by and funded by the Central Bank of
Sweden, not the Nobel Foundation)...</p>
<p>[Bernanke said after GFC] 'And although there are a lot of Americans
who understandably think that government money would be better spent
going directly to families and businesses instead of banks – "where's
our bailout?," they ask – the truth is that a dollar of capital in a
bank can actually result in eight or ten dollars of loans to families
and businesses, a multiplier effect that can ultimately lead to a
faster pace of economic growth.'</p>
<p>That is the mythical 'money multiplier' model of money creation that
the Bank of England said was rubbish in 2014. But because Bernanke
believed that myth, and Obama followed his advice, the recovery from
the Global Financial Crisis was the slowest recovery from a recession
in the history of the United States. By comparison, the recovery from
the Covid recession was the fastest—and then the money went straight
to the public, rather than to the banks.</p>
<p>For these failures, Bernanke gets the Economics Nobel"</p>

<p>Companies are required to provide certain benefits and protections to

overtime, a portion of a worker’s Social Security taxes and
contributions to unemployment insurance.</p>
<p>The proposed rule is essentially a test that the Labor Department will
apply to determine whether workers are contractors or employees for
companies. The test considers factors such as how much control workers
have over how they do their jobs and how much opportunity they have to
increase their earnings by doing things like offering new
services. Workers who have little of either are often considered

power plant. That funding would tackle the design of the
heat-extraction infrastructure needed use high-temperature steam from
existing LWRs to produce hydrogen using high-temperature electrolysis
'in preparation for future scale-up of industrial use of nuclear

<p>One method "perturbs" initial point and see how widely it changes the
future, does that many times, if outcome lands on certain prediction
over and over again, that increases confidence. Can also construct a
likelihood range around the prediction from many runs.</p>
<hr />
<p>As in life, some outcomes are more likely than others, there are ways
to compute those and report likely events.</p>
<p>"If weather systems are chaotic, ie later outcome depends on minor
changes today (which can never be accurately measured) how can we make
accurate weather predictions?"</p>
