Fortune: "Before ‚Äòquiet quitting‚Äô in the U.S., there was ‚Äòlying flat‚Äô
in China. How the anti-work movement swept the world‚Äôs two largest
economies..

A world apart, 'lying flat' and 'quiet quitting' have sprouted
parallel passive resistance movements among young people in the
world‚Äôs top two economies, flouting assumptions that Gen Z will work
just as hard as previous generations.

Individual followers of the movements have their own motivations‚Äîfrom
pandemic-era burnout to existential dread‚Äîbut a shared sense economic
defeatism is binding them together as they confront critics and defy
workaholic cultures in China and the U.S."

CNN: "Zuck is betting the future of his half-a-trillion-dollar
company, Meta, on a vision of the future in which all of us spend more
time in a virtual space known as the metaverse.. The trouble is,
everything we've seen of that future so far looks lame as hell. 'It's
genuinely puzzling that Meta spent more than $10 billion on VR last
year and the graphics in its flagship app still look worse than a 2008
Wii game,' tweeted New York Times tech columnist Kevin Roose"

H2 Fuel News: "Why are fuel cell buses becoming so popular in public
transportation?.. For many routes, [HFC] buses have proven to have
considerable performance advantage over battery electrics, becoming
the top choice for the replacement of traditional diesel models. Among
the reasons for this included the advantages of zero-emission
operations without sacrificing schedules, routes or existing functions
at depots. H2 offers longer range and faster fueling than batteries"

Forbes:  "A new study has estimated that life expectancy in the United
States dropped sharply between 2019 and 2021, decreasing by three
years on average, the steepest decline in nearly 100 years...

A precise accounting of the causes of this devastating development
cannot yet be made, but Dr. Steven Woolf, a co-author of the study,
attributed it broadly to ‚Äúthe U.S. health disadvantage.‚Äù¬†

The United States is over-invested in war and preparation for war, and
under-invested in measures aimed at alleviating poverty and disease,
which kill more Americans than any current or recent global conflict,

That actually makes sense; if they cannot explain lift in

"The physics of surfing is an enigma. In particular, it is unproven
how a surfboard accelerates across a wave, and how a surfboard can
grip the water with sufficient force to allow a surfer to stand at the

by evidence and experimentation. Surfing has evolved by intuition,
trial, and error"

Even the most white-collar, pro-globalization pols started talking
about 'workers'. Such worries were previously confined to the realm of
immigrants (or slave labor working abroad), no need to give much lip

involves natives, everyone talks about them, it's the stuff of
internal politics.

FCE's carbon capture *generates* energy? Awesome if true.

"FuelCell Energy‚Äôs platform can run on natural gas or biogas. Natural
gas and biogas both contain methane, a chemical compound with one
carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms (CH4). Fuel cells use an
electrochemical process to convert hydrogen-rich fuels into electrical
power and heat. Inside the fuel cell, methane is steam-reformed at 600
degrees Celsius and converted into hydrogen and CO2. The fuel cell
produces electricity, heat, water, and CO2, which can be exhausted or
captured...

[FCE] plants produce additional power rather than consume it during
the carbon capture process. By comparison, conventional carbon capture
technologies consume about 20 percent of a plant‚Äôs overall power
output"

Notice when they were hitting Corbyn with that how the narrative also
came coupled with a pro-Russia "accusation".  It may not have made
sense at first, such talk in a country who was "on the right side" of
WWII fighting against the Nazis being so enthusiastic to prove its
anti-Semitic credentials, but once we understand Israel's role in the
outer alliance (a frontier country) it all makes sense; Accusing
someone being pro-Russia and anti-Semitic is merely two sides of
the same coin.

Supportive statements are a secret handshake of sorts.. Instead of
saying 'I am wholeheartedly supportive of my country's long-running
strategy of containing the inner countries, block their access to the
high seas and position selves so we can choke off their trade at a
moment's notice" you just say "I dislike anti-Semitism and will repeat
that 100 more times just to make sure you get üòâ my üòâ meaning üòâ".
