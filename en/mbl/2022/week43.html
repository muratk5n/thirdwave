attempts to justify two experimental discrepancies in the Dirac

numerology, ignored infinities, hocus-pocus, manipulated calculations,
illegitimate mathematics, incomprehensible theories, hidden data,
biased experiments, miscalculations, suspicious coincidences, lies,
arbitrary substitutions of infinite values and budgets of 600 million

needed. But it’s not hard to guess. The intervention is designed to
rescue Ukrainian forces from defeat..</p>
<p>Petraeus’s suggestion confirms two critical insights. First, the
perilous state of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Absent the foreign
fighters and Polish soldiers fighting in Ukrainian uniform, Ukraine
has little left to withstand the Russian winter offensives. The series
of Ukrainian counterattacks over the last 60 to 90 days have cost
Ukraine tens of thousands of lives, human capital in uniform that Kiev
cannot replace...</p>

<p>Bhadrakumar: "The EU has now become a captive market for Big Oil and
is left to buy LNG from the US at the asking price, which is six to
seven times higher than the domestic price in the US.. The Americans
are cocooned in a surreal world of their self-serving narrative that
Russia ‘lost’ the war. In the real world, though [.. things look
different]"</p>

<p>Calling a function instead of passing the function pointer.. rookie
<code>multiprocessing</code> mistake. <code>Pool(func(arg1,arg2))</code> instead of
<code>Pool(func,args=(arg1,arg2))</code>.. Tsck, tsck, tsck.. Then programmer
wonders why everything is running serially not paralel. You paralized
the mufucka that's why.</p>
<hr />
<p>H2 Central: "[H2] has potential as a source for electricity in our
homes: South Korea opened a hydrogen fuel cell plant last year—the
world’s largest—that will supply power to 250,000 households
annually... In Japan.. there are 400,000 residential fuel cell units

<p>"@MazzucatoM</p>
<p>When [the] @WIRED ⁩piece was written, capitalism still had (weak)
legs. Now it’s looking for crutches. No better time than this to
rethink fundamentals"</p>
<hr />
<p>Wired: "[2019] What.. infuriated [the economist] Mazzucato was the
prevailing narrative that [gov spending] cuts were necessary to boost
competitiveness and innovation... 'There was this belief that we
didn’t have European Googles and Facebooks because we didn’t subscribe
to Silicon Valley’s free market approach. It was just ideology: there
was no free market in Silicon Valley.'..</p>
<p>[Mazzucato researched the issue]. The development of Google’s search
algorithm, for instance, had been supported by a grant from the
National Science Foundation, a US public grant-awarding body... Many
other well-known US startups had been funded by the Small Business
Innovation Research programme, a public venture capital fund. 'It
wasn’t just early research, it was also applied research, early stage
finance, strategic procurement,' she says. 'The more I looked, the
more I realised: state investment is everywhere.'"</p>
