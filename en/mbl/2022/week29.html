globally. A money system prepared for that would have used digital
money that "prints" UBI monthly for everyone, by default, business

<p>There is a place for the thriftiness in the pol spectrum, it
contributes to the average. I'm not interested in the spectrum which
actually indicates failure of analysis. The aim for analysis should be
to pinpoint the optimality before it is reached.</p>

<p>When govs decided to protect employment the direct result of that
would be inflation. No escape from that. The spend-thrift guy has no
extra analysis, he keeps repeating the same thing over and over.</p>
<hr />
<p>Govs around the world wanted to protect businesses, through payment protection
schemes, encouraging them to keep employees. So many people stayed at home
getting payments, building up savings. After opening up those savings
became excess demand which helped a rise in inflation. Since many countries
(especially in the West) followed similar schemes, global inflation was
pushed up. Then there was the supply disruptions. </p>

<p>Renew Economy: "'Eureka moment' as Australian researchers make
hydrogen storage breakthrough.. A team from Deakin University’s
Institute for Frontier Materials (IFM) in Melbourne says it has found
a new mechanochemical way of separating and storing gases, which is
safe, uses a tiny fraction of the energy compared to traditional
methods and creates zero waste.</p>
<p>The hero ingredient in the breakthrough is boron nitride powder, which
is has a knack for absorbing substances, being small, but with a large
amount of surface area. It’s also classed as a “level-0 chemical,”
something that is deemed perfectly safe to have in your house.</p>
<p>The researchers put boron nitride powder into a ball mill – a type of
grinder containing small stainless-steel balls in a chamber – along
with the gases that need to be separated.</p>
<p>As the chamber rotates at a higher and higher speed, the balls collide
with the powder and the wall of the chamber triggers a mechanochemical
reaction resulting in gas being absorbed into the powder.</p>
<p>One type of gas is absorbed quicker, separating it out from the
others, and allowing it to be easily removed from the mill. The
process can be repeated over several stages to separate the gases one
by one.</p>
<p><img width="200" src="twimg/FX9zA-MWAAAxXrO.jpg"/></p>
<p>All up, the process consumes 76.8 KJ/s to store and separate 1000L of
gases, which means it uses at least 90 per cent less than the current
gas separation process commonly used in the petroluem industry...</p>
<p>Even more significantly, once the gas is absorbed into the powder it
gas can be transported safely and easily. When the gas is needed, the
powder can be simply heated in a vacuum to release the gas unchanged...</p>
<p>[The team shows] there’s mechanochemical alternative, using ball

km/s/Mpc. Since 2000, 'early universe' techniques based on
measurements of the cosmic microwave background have become available,

the change in the expansion rate since the early universe, so is
comparable to the first number.) As techniques have improved, the
estimated measurement uncertainties have shrunk, but the range of
measured values has not, to the point that the disagreement is now
highly statistically significant. This discrepancy is called the

<p>Russia was presumed to require an operational pause after taking
Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in late June, but current evidence
suggests that, to the contrary, Moscow has kept the pressure on the
Ukrainian defenders. When the Ukrainian troops withdrew from
Lysychansk, they repositioned along a new line of defense,
north-to-south from Seversk, to Soledar, to Bahkmut.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, Russian and Western media were reporting that Russian
troops were already in the outskirts of Seversk, and within a few
miles of both Soledar and Bahkmut – and all three are receiving
withering artillery and rocket fire, along with air strikes. Once
Russian forces break through this new line of defense, the twin-cities
of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk lie barely 25 miles to the west. The
Ukrainian troops would be hard-pressed to put up a successful defense
of either, as Russia could drive the attack with its forces from three
