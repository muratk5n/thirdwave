Evolution is wild.</p>
<p>LA Times: In Alaska, wood frogs freeze for seven months, thaw and hop
away.. Each September, the wood frogs of Alaska do a very strange
thing: They freeze. They do not freeze totally solid, but they do
freeze mostly solid. Two-thirds of their body water turns to ice. If
you picked them up, they would not move. If you bent one of their
legs, it would break.</p>
<p>Inside these frozen frogs other weird physiological things are going
on. Their hearts stop beating, their blood no longer flows and their
glucose levels sky rocket.</p>
<p>“On an organismal level they are essentially dead,” said Don Larson, a
graduate student at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks who studies
frogs. “The individual cells are still functioning, but they have no
way to communicate with each other.”</p>
<p>The craziest thing of all may be that in this frozen state, they can
withstand temperatures as low as zero degrees Fahrenheit for as long
as seven months, and then, when spring arrives, thaw out and hop away.</p>

reason is that DL applications.. belong to the family of 'non-testable
program', for which, strictly speaking, oracles do not
exist. Moreover, finding such bugs in DL libraries can be very hard
and tedious. A DL model developed by a user typically consists of many
floating point parameters and operations (up to billions). Even with a
few bugs, the model may still be created, trained, and appeared to
work...  While there are various explanations for an unexpected
behaviour that need to be ruled out, the worst is the fact that the
faulty computation is not explicitly developed by the user, but
implicitly produced by the library. However, little information can be
obtained from the DL model’s internal mechanism and training/inference
due to the 'black-box' and stochastic nature of DL
training/inference. Hence, any bugs in DL libraries may lead to bugs
in the user’s program that the user might not, easily, become aware

<p>The Herald: "Ministers have unveiled a plan to help Scotland become a
world leader in hydrogen production which they say could generate up
to £25 billion a year and provide more than 300,000 jobs.</p>
<p>The blueprint, published yesterday, sets out the sets they will take
to help meet the target of producing a sixth of the country's power
needs from hydrogen by 2030, some 5 Gigawatts.</p>
<p>A further goal is to produce 25 Gigawatts of hydrogen by 2045 - the
year the Scottish Government want the county to be net zero"</p>

<p>Smart how they compared different items on a multivariable plot; each
variable is a corner, better/worse numeric values bring you further or
closer to the center, you want the best item to be on the outside, a
connected ring envoloping all the others in that web, (clearly DBT in
this plot).</p>

<p>Compressed H2 is ok for short trips that can be made frequently due to
max capacity, it looks suitable for eg Oz-Japan not as much for
SA-Japan. I made some calcs below for 40 trips / year and a fleet of
20 ships, using 250 bar H2 having 700 kwh/m3,</p>
<pre><code class="python">capacity = 120000 #m3
print (&quot;Single ship %0.1f MW&quot; % ((ship * 700) / (365*24*1e3)))
ann_trips = 40
print (&quot;Fleet capacity %0.1f GW&quot; % ((20 * ann_trips * capacity * 700) / (365*24*1e6)))
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">Single ship 9.6 MW
Fleet capacity 7.7 GW

<p>The true test of an energy system is not the easy stuff but the
worst-case scenario. Resilience being the 1ary metric. The Herculean
efforts of the grid engineers is a failure of the system. And the
Pathé News-style spin would be laughable, if it was not so
serious. It's 2022"</p>

much better for people"</p>
