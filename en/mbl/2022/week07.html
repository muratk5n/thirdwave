<p>At the height of US's logistic support campaign to Britain during

<p>Military is a function of a country's underlying economy, and the
economy is a function of its inherent diversity. If a country is
producing nuts and bolts it can put them together for a weapon during
the time of war. If one is producing only bolts, they can't build
shit.. This is why Beckley's power measure is ingenious; it captures
all that through a simple base econ value.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's not entirely correct to judge a country's power by looking at its
military size, its ships, guns. Military power is also a function of
what a country <em>can build</em> on demand, when all the chips are
down.. That is deeply related to its industrial, tech capacity, its
economy.</p>

using CSP. A number of researchers (and a couple of startup companies)
are developing 'solar thermochemical water splitting' which uses a
catalyst (like ceria) at very high temperature to split steam into
hydrogen and oxygen. CSP can also be integrated with high temperature
steam electrolysis (using solid oxide electrolysis cells) to
electrolytically split water at higher efficiencies than typical PEM
electrolyzers"</p>
