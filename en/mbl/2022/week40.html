<p>Newsweek Opinion: "[T]he United States' formal position on the [RU/UA]
conflict has changed markedly little. That overly simplified and
Manichaean position, in short, is one of Ukrainian maximalism: Putin
is evil, Volodymyr Zelensky is noble, and—here is the big logical
leap—the United States will thus support the Ukrainian effort to
retake every square inch of territory in the Donbas and Crimea from
its nuclear-armed adversary, seemingly no matter the cost to the
U.S. taxpayer...</p>
<p>At this stage in the war, virtually all of this pablum is asinine and
counterproductive to the actual U.S. national interest in these
contested areas. Our national interest in the Ukrainian theater is not
coterminous with Zelensky's absolutist stance; our interest is for
de-escalation, detente"</p>

<p>Heritage has little effect in defining culture. Behaviour is mostly
shaped by subconcious codes received through osmosis from the larger
society around, burned into psyche before teenage. The process is

mumbled in rote, in robes, or funky hats.</p>
<hr />
<p>US bizarre distant heritage worship is likely part of a psyop.. If
your citizens think of themselves as near-peer to citizens in other
countries, such population would be more open to persuasion for

<p>Let's not forget it was Nixon who ended the war in Vietnam, not JFK.</p>

<p>That's interesting take on guerilla wars.</p>
<p>Nixon: "[First Press Conf, 1969, answering the question 'do you
consider it possible to have a cease-fire in Vietnam so long as the
Vietcong still occupy Vietnamese territory?]'</p>
<p>I think that it is not helpful in discussing Vietnam to use such terms
as 'cease-fire' because cease-fire is a term of art that really has no
relevance, in my opinion, to a guerrilla war. When you are talking
about a conventional war, then a cease-fire agreed upon by two parties
means that the shooting stops. When you have a guerrilla war, in which
one side may not even be able to control many of those who are
responsible for the violence in the area, the cease-fire may be
meaningless"</p>

the destructive potential of a windstorm – was more than four times
that of Charley (46 terajoules - TJ to 10 TJ)... Second, Ian tracked

<p>Math can deal with infinities but particles aren't infinite. There's
just a lot of them. Dealing with infinitesimals help with certain
stuff but they are by no means the true reflection of the underlying
mechanics.  It's all an approximation in the end. God does not need
math.</p>
<p>"Math and physics work bcz both are based on the many small particles"</p>

<p>The nepotism charge is warranted; the familial relation puts you
further ahead among advisers, they're supposed to be equals but the

<p>BTW Bannon says Kush was in the pro-China camp, along with Cohn,
Tillerson, Buttafuoco</p>

<p>Rubin, Summers got burned </p>
<p>"During the 1992 presidential campaign, Democratic candidate Bill
Clinton had talked tough on China—at one point accusing George
H. W. Bush, then president, of cozying up to 'the butchers of
Beijing.' In his confirmation hearings Warren Christopher, Clinton’s
choice for secretary of state, served notice that he would take a
tough line with China. So, in a move that the Chinese later dubbed
'the Clinton coup,' China’s top diplomats developed warm relations
with two of Clinton’s top economic advisers, Robert Rubin and Larry
Summers, who were more sympathetic to China, and worked through them
to persuade Clinton to dial back his antagonism. The Chinese had used
the same tactic during the Bush and Obama administrations, and they
had largely succeeded" #Kush</p>
<hr />
<p>Environment issues aren't just theoretical for many countries </p>
<p>"When we arrived in Beijing [2017 visit], the city glistened in the
reflection of the pure blue sky. At the command of the Chinese
Communist Party, the coal-burning power plants and factories had been
shut down for the three weeks leading up to our visit to allow the
smog and soot to dissipate" #Kush</p>

<p>The book should've been titled "Finally Taking My Revenge Against Bannon"</p>

locomotives that operate push-pull sets... They will be manufactured
in Utah at Stadler’s Salt Lake City factory. The hydrogen fuel cells
