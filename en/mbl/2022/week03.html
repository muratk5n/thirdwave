<hr />
<p>By its foundation the check on power in US was achieved by having
<em>seperate</em> branches balancing eachother, not requiring supermajority
<em>within</em> each branch. Appeals to history, customs in this regard have
no basis. SCOTUS works on simple majority. The House passes laws same
way. President is the singular decision maker within his branch (not
even a minority there). The founders could surely arrange some stuff
to require supermajorities within each branch if they thought that was
important. But they didn't.</p>
<hr />
<p>Simple majority should matter. It already does for pres elections for
instance. An handful more votes in a single key state can make one
President.</p>
<p>If it's good for one branch of gov, why not for another?</p>

<p>Batteries are too heavy, the train would not move (or catch fire and blow up)</p>
<hr />
<p>As it stands CA railway project is a disaster, will have eaten up over
$100 billion, and as of now it hasn't transported a single passenger.</p>
<p>Buying up land in the path of the project apparently caused some delays,
but overall mismanagement was worse, and the choice of going electric
is a major part of that / its symptom. It points to a pervasive
foolishness when it comes to deciding on green tech. Store green fuel
in one car of the train, enough to propel the whole train for an
entire SF/LA trip. No need for electrified lines, simpler design.</p>

<p>The main culprit was running out of money, and switching to dirty

<p>Why the water problems back in 2011-15? Flint MI went broke, had lots
of unfunded pension costs. They started cutting services, switching to

<p>I mean, seriously, how could this stuff <em>not</em> leak, especially at the
end-user level? Pipeline goes into homes, into some crack-ass
mechanism built by god-knows-who, with average design.. Unless it was
built with complete containment in mind, which in regular market
conditions would be hard, and hard to regulate, stuff would invariably
leak.</p>
<hr />
<p>Yep - natgas pipelines leak. The end user (home/business) leaks,
possibly worse.  Fossil in any shape or form should not move from
source to customer, bcz anywhere in that chain it can leak. The only
thing that moves, and used at end-user must be green fuel.</p>
<p>"The study suggests many of these [natgas.. ] leaks come from homes and
businesses.. The team's analyses suggest the five biggest urban areas
studied‚Äîwhich together include about 12% of the nation's

<p>Those are not real particles, they are 'pockets' in the fluid that are
followed around. The act of following somewhat resembles following
around a particle, that's where the P comes from... But look
carefully, there is the Navier-Stokes formula lurking in there, which
uses concepts such as pressure, viscosity, heat, concocted at a macro
level, not micro. Without the formula, there is no SPH.</p>
<p>"I saw a method called SPH, smoothed particle hydrodynamics, for
fluids. It says 'particles' right there!"</p>
<hr />
<p>There is a term in FD formulas that says 'if there is a pressure
difference between two regions there will be a force between those
regions, from high to low'. Declerative, broad statement... works
brilliantly. Later when we compute the FD formula we cut its field
into little regions, and either average over them (one method), or
look at the edge points (another method). IOW we work with things we
can measure, and relate them, discretize later.</p>
<p>Nature doesn't give a shit about pressure. It can send off one
trillion particles one way, another trillion another way, the ones
that hit a surface are what we see as pressure, the ones that jiggle
too much are what we see as heat, Nature could not care less. We
cannot compete with Nature at that level... If we tried we'd have to
create a computer as big as Nature. So we need to use our math to
generalize, inventing relations, methods to represent better relations
between attributes we measure.</p>
