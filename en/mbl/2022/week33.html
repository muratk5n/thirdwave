<p>"The rising cost of second-hand vehicles is a consequence of the
semiconductor chip shortage that's been hammering the motor industry
since Covid-19 lockdowns were first a thing. The short supply of chips
has bottlenecked car production, with outputs slumping by more than a
third as manufacturers struggle to get their hands on the much-needed
components. To put the scale of the problem into perspective,
approximately 40 chips of varying capabilities are needed for the
average family motor today, such is the substantial reliance of
electronics in the latest vehicles"</p>

from one of Masters‚Äô supporters, posted on an exclusive Discord chat:
'How can one man be so based?'. The uninitiated reader might be
forgiven for asking: 'Based on what?'  The word, a slang term with
origins in hip-hop culture, has been adopted in recent years by the
extremely online far right to basically mean 'anything that owns the

pet project of 'dismantling the administrative state,'"</p>

<p>30-35 C temp indoors is comfortable, not a big deal.. The problem is
outdoors, pavements, per below. Temp measurements are taken in the
shade. Where sun <em>falls</em> on pavement is at a higher / temperature,
higher than that day's temperature. This is the root of the hellish
experiences, especially in cities. And.. most of our cities are just
bloody pavement right?</p>
<hr />
<p>Good point</p>
<p>"Shade doesn't actually make temperatures cooler. Rather, being in
direct sunlight and solar radiation makes the air feel 10 to 15
degrees warmer than it actually is, said.. a retired weather service
meteorologist. 'So, conversely, it would feel that much cooler in the
shade,' he said. Similarly, when the  ocean breeze comes up,
temperatures will feel 4 to 5 degrees cooler, particularly if you've
been sweating. And if you're looking for yet another means to buffer
the outside heat, find some grass. It will feel a few degrees cooler
than the heat rising off of pavement"</p>

<p>Gobble gobble gov subsidizing 75% of gobble gobble farms for capacity
over 7000? Interesting.. The bird grows in half a year, so 14,000
birds a year, markets sell a kilo for 6 USD, say farms sell it for 3
USD a piece, 7000 x 2 x 4 x 3 = 168000 USD per year, since costs are
mostly subsidized, cld leave over 120K USD after subtracting costs..
Not bad for a farmer.</p>
