<p>Fundamental research has seen giants in its past; Gauss could ask a

<p>After WWII US became the center of science; they were supposed to be

of view they've done a piss poor job of it. The fruitless avenues
scientists are stuck at now remind me how bizarre gismos that are
constantly "invented" there, the same mentality seems to have been
applied to fundamental science. The problem is gismos go away if they
can't find traction, but the bizarre avenues linger until the lost
muckers stuck in them are dead or their funding is cut. Rube Goldberg
approach doesn't work for fundamentals.</p>

demonstrated what was possible with a digital approach. Using sensors
to monitor things like temperature, crankshaft position, mass air
flow, throttle position, and concentration of oxygen in the exhaust
gases, automakers were able to dramatically improve the fuel economy
and emissions profiles of their vehicles. The controller chips did
