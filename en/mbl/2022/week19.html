battlefield trendlines support the prospect of a Ukrainian defeat...</p>
<p>In mid-April, Russia captured the critical transportation hub of Izyum
near the northern shoulder of the Donbas lines. Just days ago, after
nearly a two-month battle, Putin’s troops captured another key city in
northern Donbas that controls several essential road junctions in
Popasnaya. Kremlin forces have now pushed deeper into Severdonetsk,
putting Ukrainian troops at risk at Lysychansk, just to the southwest
of Severdonetsk...</p>
<p>Whether Putin has enough troops, ammunition, and time to complete the
destruction of the UAF positions in the Donbas without mobilizing some
portion of its reserve forces is an open question. What is clear,
however, is that Russia’s current operations are slowly strangling
Ukrainian troops in the Donbas and that despite optimistic rhetoric
out of Kyiv and Western capitals, the battle is trending towards a
Russian tactical success, possibly within two months...</p>
<p>Militarily speaking, there is very little hope that even all the
promised support of heavy weapons and ammunition from the West can be
delivered to the front, the Ukrainian troops adequately trained, and
firepower brought to bear in time to change the course...</p>
<p>By continuing to seek a military victory in Ukraine, Ukraine’s troops
will continue fighting, no negotiated settlement will be realistically
sought, and most likely Russian troops continue making progress. As a
result, more Ukrainian civilians and troops will continue to be killed
and wounded, more cities destroyed, and the economic and food crises –
for both Ukraine and the world – will worsen. The most likely outcome
will not change (a negotiated settlement, not a Ukrainian military
victory), but the cost to Kyiv will be much, much worse"</p>

<p>#Documentary #WSJ "Trucking used to be one of the very best blue
collar jobs in the US. The industry was almost fully unionized by the
teamsters union.  Unionized truck drivers were making up to 20% more
than even unionized steel workers or auto workers. It was one of the
best jobs you could get, and when you got one of those good jobs you
were likely to stay in it until you until you retired. [But] the
industry was deregulated 1980, the union was pushed out of the big
segments of the of the industry, and and wages and working conditions
followed [became worse]"</p>

<p>Had to guide the processing towards the goal; remove small patches,
tell the segmentation algo to look at coarse objects, put a lower
limit on segment size.. lots of small nudges here and there. There is
no free lunch. There is no 'Alexa give me the interesting image blocks
and boundaries in this image'.</p>

<p>AP News: "[New] post-Brexit rules, which took effect after Britain
left the European Union, have imposed customs and border checks on
some goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the U.K. The
arrangement was designed to keep an open border between Northern
Ireland and EU member Ireland, a key pillar of the peace process.</p>
<p>But the rules angered many [DUP members], who maintain that the new
checks have created a barrier between Northern Ireland and the rest of
the U.K. that undermines their British identity. In February, the
DUP’s Paul Givan resigned as first minister in protest against the
arrangements, triggering a a fresh political crisis in Northern
Ireland"</p>
