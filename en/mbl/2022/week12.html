<p>H2 View: "In a bid to secure US Department of Energy (DOE) funding for
the development of a hydrogen hub, the West Virginia Hydrogen Hub
Coalition has officially submitted its proposal. The state becomes one
of the first to officially submit a proposal with the Mountain State’s
abundance of renewable energy set to be coupled for mass hydrogen
production and the integration of several end applications to boost
the hydrogen economy..</p>
<p>West Virginia already has a rich background in coal, gas and oil and
thus could have an extensive list of potential hydrogen customers that
can be utilised to surge demand for the clean energy carrier. Another
important factor is the availability of skill energy workforce and
with West Virginia’s already established energy sector, the jobs could
transition to hydrogen and support the emerging technologies and
wprojects.</p>
<p>US Senator Joe Manchin, Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural
Resources Committee, said, 'With our abundant energy sources and
strong partnerships, our state is uniquely situated to compete to
develop a hydrogen hub..'"</p>

<p>Salt caverns, and lined rock caverns.. There is a third method, using
pipeline pieces, underground..  We know a pipeline network itself is
also a storage mechanism, well, why not use pieces of pipeline
hardware and stack them on top of eachother underground, creating an
uber storage system?</p>
<hr />
<p>Here is another method</p>
<p>CNBC: "[2020] Caverns can be created in salt domes by drilling into
the salt dome and injecting the rock with water, which dissolves the
salt. The resulting brine is extracted, leaving a large cavity. The
next step is storing hydrogen in the cavern...</p>
<p>'[One] formation has the potential to create up to 100 caverns, each
one capable of holding 150,000 MWh of energy,' says Browning [CEO of
Mitsubishi Power US, now at Fortesque]. 'It would take 40,000 shipping
containers of batteries to store that much energy in each cavern.'"</p>

<p>26.7 million dollars for 100 m3 storage. At 250 bars H2 has energy
density is 700 kwh/m3, this is 70 MWh of storage. It's pretty cheap.
The equivalent lion battery install would cost over $50 million. </p>

<p>Daily Scandanavian: "Hydrogen Storage Facility in Sweden Has Reached
Halfway Point in Construction..  Construction of the 100-cubic-meter..
rock cavern storage facility 30 meters below ground is done by
Vattenfall AB in collaboration with Swedish steel company SSAB AB..,
iron ore miner Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara AB..  The three owners
invested around USD 21.4m.. in three equal parts, with the Swedish
Energy Agency contributing just over SEK 52 million towards the
hydrogen storage construction.</p>
<p>The cavern is being built via the so-called lined rock cavern (LRC)
approach, which involves covering the walls of the cavern with a
selected matter. The technology for storing gas in a lined rock cavern
(LRC) is well proven and has been used in southern Sweden for about 20
years for storing natural gas. However, the technology is now taking
another step forward as it’s being developed for the first time with
hydrogen gas on a large pilot scale... The finished plant will contain
hydrogen gas pressurized up to 250 bar"</p>

that appears unlikely — especially given the nuclear arsenal with
which Russia can in effect blackmail the world.</p>

US responded).</p>

<p>Devine, <em>Laptop from Hell</em>: "Five days after Costello’s late-night
call, on Wednesday, October 14, 2020, the <em>New York Post</em> published
the first of a series of front-page bombshells,.. culled from the
contents of Hunter’s laptop. The story, headlined 'Biden’s Secret
Emails,' revealed a bombshell 2015 email indicating that Joe, as vice
president, had met in Washington with a high-ranking representative of
the corrupt Ukrainian energy company that was paying his junkie son a
million dollars a year to sit on its board. Eight months after the
meeting, Joe flew to Kyiv and threatened to withhold $1 billion in US
aid unless the Ukrainian government fired its top prosecutor, Viktor
Shokin, who was pursuing Burisma for corruption at the time. The email
was news, in anyone’s language.</p>
<p>But soon after the Post’s story broke online, social media censored
it. Facebook announced it had throttled the story’s reach. Twitter
locked the Post’s account for two weeks, then admitted after the
election that it had made a mistake. It was a chilling exercise of raw
political power by an unaccountable Big Tech—the term given to the
oligopoly of global corporations that dominate the information
technology industry.</p>
<p>The coordinated censorship of America’s oldest newspaper, with the
fourth largest circulation in the nation, amounted to election
interference. It was a historic moment that rang alarm bells around
the world and would harden resolve on Capitol Hill to rein in the
power of the social media giants"</p>
<hr />
<p>Even some in the establishment must have seen the current state of
play in UKR is no good, largely US's fault. The Hunter Biden thing
resurfacing might be a message to WH..  The HB expose is key bcz it
has the word 'Ukraine' written all over it.</p>
<hr />
<p>This is good</p>
<p>F24: "Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky made a fresh appeal for
meaningful talks with Moscow on Saturday to end the war as Russia said
its soldiers had entered the centre of the besieged city of Mariupol,
'tightening the noose' around the key port"</p>
<hr />
<p>Various end results for UKR-RU are possible .. One assesment I saw
claimed RU will take everything east of the Dnipro river; i.e. all of
Eastern Ukraine. UKR is close in culture to Russians, but the East is
even more so.. Then maybe RU is feeling out how things develop, doing
a little head fake on the North, but invading strongly from Southeast,
and if no agreement is forthcoming, no substantial concessions in tune
of what they wanted, they'll just take Eastern Ukraine and call it a
day.</p>
<p>Combined geographically w previously acquired regions, the whole block
actually makes sense, there is a geographical boundary between East
and West anyway, a river, and it connects nicely with the 'seperatist'
regions, plus Crimea. RU's needed 'buffer' will get bigger, and the
remaining gov in the West will probably not utter the word NATO ever
again.</p>
<hr />
<p>Today India and Russia need eachother in case of a resurgent China and
China needs Russia against what they view as a overly meddling
West. So I dont think "the Quad", or any other pact can override the
India-Russia relationship.</p>

<p>I wouldnt expect too much from pulling India out of its Russia
friendship either..  See history (above)</p>

<p>The Guardian: "Beijing’s readout of the [Biden-Xi] call did not
suggest any Chinese role in ending the war. It quoted Xi as referring
to a favourite aphorism, 'Let he who tied the bell on the tiger’s neck
take it off' , a seeming reference to China’s position that the US and
Nato are ultimately to blame"</p>
<hr />
<p>"The U.S. believed that a brief period of non-assertive foreign policy
from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s had become the new norm for
Russia. This period was not the norm but an anomaly. Putin’s foreign
policy has always been assertive, similar to Russia’s historic foreign
policy"</p>

<p>Al Jazeera: "This is not the time to brand Vladimir Putin an ‘evil
madman’. Simplifying the war in Ukraine into a binary of ‘good’ versus
‘evil’ will not save us from another world war...</p>
<p>Whether it’s describing Saddam Hussein as a 'madman,' Gaddafi as
'insane,' or Putin as a 'megalomaniac,' such caricatures serve broader
political objectives by simplifying any conflict into a clear binary
of 'good' versus 'evil'... The Israeli state often indulges in such
framing to delegitimise Palestinians – even questioning their
intelligence, by repeating ad nauseum the trope that they 'never lose
an opportunity to lose an opportunity'...</p>
<p>Such framing is now being tactfully employed to
explain away the Russian invasion of Ukraine – a manipulative
discourse construction that facilitates a fog of war"</p>

<p>Al-Monitor: "Soaring bread prices sparked by Russia's invasion of
Ukraine have bitten into the purchasing power of consumers in Egypt"</p>

<p>How can a food/energy self-sufficient country face such shortages due
to sanctions?</p>

<p>I think they are blowing smoke up your ass.. </p>
