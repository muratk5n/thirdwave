<p>The change described below would mean adding a few Ukraine-level food
shortage issues on top of ones we already have.</p>
<p>NBC News: "The report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change examined how agriculture will be affected by global warming, as
well as how food production and other changes in land use are expected
to contribute to climate change in the future. The panel concluded
that if average global temperatures rise 2 degrees Celsius over the
pre-industrial average — something that previous reports by the panel
have suggested could happen by the end of the century — the risk of
food supply instabilities 'are projected to be very high,' according
to the report, which was written by more than 100 scientists from
around the world.</p>
<p>One of the key ways food production could be affected is by extreme
weather events. Studies have shown that climate change is increasing
both the frequency and severity of extreme weather, causing more
intense downpours during storms or lengthening extreme heat waves, for
example, which can disrupt crops or alter growing seasons.. 'In the
past, bad weather in one area has been compensated by perhaps better
weather in another, but some of our research has shown that as we move
toward 2 degrees Celsius of warming, the probability of major cereal
producers facing synchronous shocks in the same season goes way up,'

Environment at Stanford University"</p>

potential of several heat transfer mediums... Investigating three heat
transfer materials: [the] liquid pathway (exploring use of molten salt
as a heat transfer material, led by NREL), a particle pathway (using
sand-like particles as a heat transfer material, led by Sandia
National Laboratories), and a third pathway exploring the use of gas
as heat transfer material (led by Brayton Energy).</p>
<p>In March of 2021, DOE down-selected among the three pathways to fund

<p>Carney has proposed a ‘synthetic hegemonic currency’ as a possible
basis for a new global monetary system. This would be comprised of a
number of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), as put forward by
Positive Money. A CBDC would provide a trusted public alternative to
private banks’ monopoly on electronic money, and would move us towards
a system where commercial banks are not freely able to create new
money as debt, as they currently do to massive negative economic,
social and environmental consequences.</p>
<p>Carney said the introduction of such CBDCs would 'be to the benefit of
citizens and businesses', and is a reform to the monetary system which
'could happen.' In fact the Bank of England is currently exploring the
idea"</p>
