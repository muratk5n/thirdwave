<p>Gas-fired plants with CCS generating electricity is relatively clean
but inefficient. Electricity as a transmission mechanism has problems;
it is slow, generation has to match demand, exactly, every time. That
causes power plants to unnecessarily ramp-up, ramp-down their
production, and/or complicated mechanisms to try to predict power
usage. Storing electricity is expensive, batteries are too heavy,
based on rare earth materials, and prone to catch fire.</p>

their chief figure was a guy nicknamed "Greek Gaddafi". This guy

world since the 40s - NF tops that!</p>

production can have little or no emissions. Until green forms of

minimal. Last Thursday saw record one day inflows. $ARKK has seen
inflows in 10 of the last 13 weeks despite a 50% YTD decline in share
price.. These are things one does not see at a bottom. The complacency
is staggering.  I fear that the investing public will soon get the

<p>You could replace the word Greece with Asia Minor and the story would

everything. Cultures around near regions are similar (bcz they produce

<p>Davis: "Throughout the first three months of the war, there were
almost universal positive statements by U.S. and Ukrainian leaders,
suggesting Kyiv’s troops would 'drive Russia from' Ukrainian soil and
that Kyiv would not accept any negotiated settlement that ceded any
territory to Russia. Yet earlier this week London’s <em>The Independent</em>
revealed portions of a leaked classified intelligence report out of
Kyiv that exposed a much harsher battlefield reality than had been
admitted publicly..</p>
<p>According to the report, Russia’s relentless bombardment of Ukrainian
troops over the first 100+ days of the war had destroyed major
portions of their Soviet-era equipment and depleted their stocks of
artillery ammunition. The result is that frontline Ukrainian units are
outgunned 20-1 in artillery and an eye-popping 40-1 in artillery
rounds. Combined with the fact Russia continues to have significant
advantages in air power (up to 300 air sorties per day compared with
three to five for Ukraine) and manpower, it is not surprising Ukraine
is losing its grip on the Donbas...</p>
<p>While it is entirely understandable that no Ukrainian leader would
ever want to cede any of its country to an invading power, there are
other, harsher realities that must be taken into account.. Zelensky
and the Ukrainian people will soon come face-to-face with the ugly
prospect that continuing to fight will only bring more death and
destruction to its people, cities, and armed forces – but be
insufficient to stave off defeat. The truth is, military fundamentals
and simple capacity are in Moscow’s favor"</p>

Pipeline: Business as Usual.. [An engineer] Johan is supervising the

Emmen.. 'The construction of these parallel pipelines is a first for
[his company]: it is the first pipeline to be laid specifically for
the transmission of hydrogen. But ‘whether it’s a natural gas pipeline
or a hydrogen pipeline, the method of construction, the technology we
use, the material for the pipelines, it’s all exactly the same,' Johan
says matter-of-factly.</p>

<p>H2 based tech requires substantially less rare earth materials. There
are even some likely tech routes that wld require zero.</p>
<p>Pitron: "For example, there is 1,000 times less neodymium and 2,200
times less gallium than there is iron in the ground. The properties of
these metals make them essential resources for the [pure
electrification] energy transition. For instance, the engines of most
'zero-emission' cars and the rotors of offshore wind turbines are both
made of neodymium, a rare metal particularly prized for its magnetic
properties. Likewise, batteries of a large share of electric cars
could not be manufactured without resources such as cobalt, graphite,
or even lithium...</p>
<p>By seeking to break free from fossil fuels and create a new, greener
world, we are setting ourselves up for a new and more potent reliance
on China, which controls most of the production of rare and critical
metals"</p>
