<p>H2 production is possible with chemical looping</p>
<p>"[2012] As one of the potential [CCS] solutions, chemical looping
technologies are projected to be economically advantageous in a
carbon-constrained scenario... [The tech] utilizes a metal oxide
material as an oxygen carrier medium to indirectly oxidize the fuel
and generate high-quality heat and/or H2. Cyclic reduction‚Äìoxidation
reactions are performed in discrete reactor vessels allowing for
inherent air‚Äìfuel separation, which provides intrinsic CO2 separation
thus mitigating the cost for CO2 capture...</p>
<p>Chemical looping processes can be described by two key applications:
chemical looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping gasification
(CLG). CLC processes use carbonaceous fuel sources, such as coal,
biomass, and natural gas, to reduce the oxygen carrier and are
followed by their direct oxidation with air to produce high-quality
heat, which can then be used for electricity
generation. Alternatively, the CLG system utilizes a third
intermediate step between the air and fuel reactor to produce a clean
energy carrier. Here, steam and/or CO2 is used to partially oxidize
the reduced oxygen carrier to produce H2"</p>

<p>An alternative to terraforming the surface of Venus would be to
colonize the upper atmosphere.. Taking advantage of the twin facts
that the upper atmosphere of Venus at an altitude of 50-55 km has a
similar temperature and pressure to Earth‚Äôs surface, and that nitrogen

possible to construct 'cloud cities' using aerostats filled with

<p>F24: "Macron warns against 'escalation' after Biden calls Putin a 'butcher'"</p>
<hr />
<p>My native country is an outer's outpost (in NATO). Been fine with this
alliance personally i.e. it is in homie interest to have a defense
against Russia. We fought these people for centuries; once RU army was
15 km near Stanpoli nearly took the city. It was through major diplom,
'alligianery' that all was saved. Keeping 'future naval powers' at bay
cld be in US citizens' interest too...</p>
<p>But, the system is fraying on the edges.. The alliance arrives with
crass ideology creating unrest leading to ultra-nationalist
movements. The pack leader US doesn't seem to be willing to fight all
the time, so in order to keep the inners contained, chaos is created,
'allowed' on the edges e.g. Iraq, Libya, Syria, Ukraine... The
spillover effect is toxic for all, especially the outposts, one could
argue, even for the seat of the empire itself.</p>

<p>F24: "Egypt will apply for a new loan from the IMF, the
Washington-based crisis lender announced Wednesday, after Russia's
invasion of Ukraine caused inflation to spike in the Middle Eastern

<p>Politico: "[The war] in Ukraine has brutally exposed the flaws in
Western security architecture.. 'The United Nations Security Council

<hr />
<p>Back during WWI artillery at least had some adventure, 'battlefield
bravery' associated with it, one tactic had infantry advance under
artillery protection / shelling ahead of troops, so when soldiers
reached their target the place would be enemy-free. Troops had to move
very carefully tho, otherwise u get hit too..? The danger!.. I believe
Canada used this technique succesfully a few times (yes, Canada!).</p>
<p>Nowadays after the advent of radio communication, it's all different.
Infantry will explore, pick a target, report back to artillery group,
who will bomb the place from 20 kilometers away. The poor sod getting
blown up won't know what hit him, being shelled by someone who has no
idea who he is, identified by infantry who is completely seperate from
the bombing itself. Tis the modern war.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's true.. </p>
<p>Al Jazeera: "'This fighting is not how you imagine it from the
movies,' said [Ukrainian filmmaker] Sentsov.. 'Close contact, shooting
from small arms, there is not so much of it. Most of the time this is
artillery and your task is to hold the front line in the trenches, and
not to die from the shelling'</p>

sense</p>
