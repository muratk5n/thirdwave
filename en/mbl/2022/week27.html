<p>The Atlantic: "Not too long ago, I heard one of the leading Brexiteers
describe his political philosophy in a room full of CEOs and senior
politicians. He started by talking to this elite group about the great
division between 'elites' and 'the people,' the victors and the
victims of globalization, the haves and the have-nots of
modernity. The longer he spoke, the more his words began to seem rote,
remote, and stale. The energizing slogans of the Brexit campaign of
2016 sounded hollow and clich‚Äã‚Äã√©d in 2022. Partly, this is because the
slogans were not true.</p>
<p>Globalization was indeed bad for some people and good for others, but
those groups didn‚Äôt split neatly along a rural-urban or rich-poor
divide, or along any other easily defined demographic line. Some
farmers in the distant countryside turned out to be huge beneficiaries
of Britain‚Äôs European Union membership. Some of the least-well-off
Britons benefited from foreign investment.</p>
<p>Besides, many of the people loudly attacking the ‚Äúelite‚Äù were not
actually among globalization‚Äôs losers themselves. Boris Johnson was
the standout example of this phenomenon: He attended Eton and
Oxford.. , and his campaign was paid for by hedge-fund managers and
billionaires. More important, Brexit, the solution to the problem
Johnson and his supporters described, was based on a series of
lies. The electorate was promised that departure from the EU would
lead not only to fewer immigrants but to greater prosperity, more
welfare spending, less crowded hospitals. Instead, six years after the
vote, Britain is less prosperous and more unequal. Brexit reduced the
U.K. GDP by at least 1.5 percent even before it took full effect; the
U.K. has the highest inflation rate in the G7; small businesses,
especially importers, have been crushed by Brexit-related red tape and
supply-chain problems. Though committees have been set up to look for
'benefits from Brexit,' few are available"</p>

<p>History Channel: "Israel‚Äôs stunning victory in the Six-Day War of 1967
left the Jewish nation in control of territory four times its previous
size. Egypt lost the 23,500-square-mile Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza
Strip, Jordan lost the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Syria lost
the strategic Golan Heights. When Anwar el-Sadat became president of
Egypt in 1970, he found himself leader of an economically troubled
nation that could ill afford to continue its endless crusade against
Israel. He wanted to make peace and thereby achieve stability and
recovery of the Sinai, but after Israel‚Äôs 1967 victory it was unlikely
that Israel‚Äôs peace terms would be favorable to Egypt. So Sadat
conceived of a daring plan to attack Israel again, which, even if
unsuccessful, might convince the Israelis that peace with Egypt was
necessary.</p>
<p>In 1972, Sadat expelled 20,000 Soviet advisers from Egypt and opened
new diplomatic channels with Washington, D.C., which, as Israel‚Äôs key
ally, would be an essential mediator in any future peace talks. He
formed a new alliance with Syria, and a concerted attack on Israel was
planned"</p>

Luhansk Province under Ukrainian control. Now with both in hand,
Russia effectively controls all of the resource-rich region and can
regroup with Donetsk in its cross hairs. Controlling Sievierodonetsk

offensives on cities to the southwest, notably Sloviansk, Kramatorsk

resorted to these secondary issues, measures (and were pummeled by
