the amount of energy it can extract by squeezing together two forms of

took its place (just as polluting, if not more). Natgas is now on par
with oil but I'd say NG is now the king.</p>
<p>The oscillations for natgas indicates to me its consumption is much
more sensitive / responsive to demand, is depended on more, looks
seasonal so NG is probably the primary method for heating. NG is the
king to unseat. Or utilize, with blue H2, it's fine.</p>

In some distant future such record-keeping could completely move to

<hr />
<p>He was fired from CNN yes, for being anti-semitic or something.. which
can mean anything these days</p>
<hr />
<p>Marc Lamont Hill is good on Al Jazeera. He asked tough q to an
official on vax patents and gov funding - that guy was sweatin'</p>
<hr />
<p>Didn't Renzi try a constitution change once, was it around this issue?
If yes, someone should pick that up again. Actually just do the
change, ask ppl later if they liked it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let people chose reps, fine.. I am against asking them on policies.</p>
<hr />
<p>Italian parliament cld switch to a ranked-choice voting, that way
someone is chosen for Prez for sure.</p>
<p>Or let people elect the President direct, like Renzi said...</p>
<hr />
<p>People say many things; I am sure things are changing, but culture
codes change very slowly..</p>
<p>"But Brits say class is not an issue anymore"</p>
<hr />
<p>UK's culture code for itself is CLASS (whereas in US it is DREAM)..A
lot of issues are probably perceived through the prism of
class... Parties made PM look high-society, posh, although BJ himself
doesn't come across that way. </p>
<p>"Partygate paradox: Why are Brits so obsessed with Boris Johnson's parties?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Gina Raimondo is on the globalizer camp according to reports. Wiki
says her father lost his job to outsourcing (China) back in the day.</p>
<hr />
<p>Alfred Nobel never wanted an econ prize, his relatives say <a href="../../2018/05/faux-nobel.html">kill it</a>
today. Rabid speculators like Sholes won it before, 1997, a year before his
hedge fund would crash using his "Nobel level" techniques, causing bunch
of collateral damage around it. </p>
<hr />
<p>Much remains to do in econ. Until some natural sciences level stuff is
achieved, the Nobel Prize for econ needs to be canceled. </p>
<hr />
<p>Real potential GDP, in FRED <code>GDPPOT</code> is being tracked. Cool.. For
ppl who like to play with such variables there is a wealth of data out
there.</p>
<hr />
<p>According to Fed's Fred covid recession only lasted for two months,
Feb 2020 - Apr 2020. Seems short.</p>
