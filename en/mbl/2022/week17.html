<p>Pre-modern agro implies certain lifestyle; staticity, unorthodox
relationships with the goat (let's define "what 'is' is" kind of
relationship) worshipping ancestors, and of course they were driven to
sacrifice the odd human here and there. These were feudal
cobsuckers. Then they would be run over by an empire like the Romans,
Otto (there is always a bigger cobsucker) and this pattern would
continue for centuries.</p>

<p>Don't butt in the market mechanism, in a mishmash way; no more gov
backed loans for anything. Private schools can be mandated to accept a
certain percentage tuition-free (not through a grant, or scholarship),
those seats would essentially be completely outside the market

<p>Bingo - Sallie Mae, founded in the 70s</p>
<p>Forbes: "Congress also created a new entity, Sallie Mae, with the
right to borrow at rock-bottom interest rates. Such a creature was
unprecedented: until then, only the United States government could
borrow so cheaply. In an eerie foreshadowing of the subprime mortgage
crisis, Sallie Mae flooded banks with cheap cash, purchasing student
loans directly or lending to banks using student loans as
collateral. The system gave banks the incentive—and the ability—to
make as many student loans as possible...</p>
<p>Everyone involved—from politicians to banks to universities—convinced
themselves they were heroes. It’s true that the convoluted system
enabled many young people of limited means to attend college. But at
the same time, student loan defaults soared. So did college tuition"</p>

produces fewer amounts of actinides, reducing the radiotoxicity of
long life nuclear waste. Th02 has higher corrosion resistance than
U02, besides being chemically stable due to their low water
solubility. The burning of Pu in a reactor based in thorium also
decreases the inventories of Pu from the current fuel cycles,
resulting in lower risks of material diversion for use in nuclear
weapons"</p>

<p>Wiki: "A molten salt reactor (MSR) is a class of nuclear fission
reactor in which the primary nuclear reactor coolant and/or the fuel

aimed to prove the concept of a nuclear power plant which implements a
thorium fuel cycle in a breeder reactor. Increased research into
Generation IV reactor designs began to renew interest in the
technology, with multiple nations having projects and, as of September
2021, China is on the verge of starting its TMSR-LF1 thorium MSR..</p>
<p>A further key characteristic of MSRs is operating temperatures of
around 700 °C (1,292 °F), significantly higher than traditional LWRs
at around 300 °C (572 °F).. economical hydrogen production."</p>

<p>On the previously shared Eslake comment "Schemes that allow people to
pay more for housing than they otherwise would, will result in more
expensive housing". Then how can we help people to have housing?</p>
<p>Increasingly it looks like butting into market mechanism can
backfire. So best help in any area should aim to take entire swaths of
said area out of the market-based system. For health insurance,
single-payer is much better right (which takes nearly the totality of
health insurance out of private scheme) than trying to co-exist with
the market which fails to insure everyone (Obamacare).</p>
<p>For housing, gov can pay, employ, manage projects seperately, outside
the market structure to build, deliver housing. Slightly nudging one
rate here, fiddling with the market there can create unwanted
side-effects. In US we saw it happen; those orgs Eddie, Freddie,
Fannie, whatever, they've been there for decades, yet in US median
house price now reached nearly half a million dollars. Fannie, Freddie

<p>Politico: "Don’t expect Macron’s win to reset UK-France ties.. Yet
British officials — who have previously blamed the French electoral
campaign for rows with Macron’s government on everything from
post-Brexit fishing rights to a nuclear submarine deal with Australia
and the treatment of undocumented Channel migrants — don’t expect a
huge diplomatic reset to follow the result.</p>
<p>Instead, they’re eyeing more modest wins, and hoping for more dialogue
between the two leaders in the coming months. And, despite Johnson’s
hopeful remarks, the mood music coming out of the French government
Monday wasn’t drastically different either"</p>

combustion, to process mixed feedstock (biogenics, plastics and/or
methane) into saleable products in an environmentally friendly,
efficient and profitable way. Our story begins in 1885 with Daniel

<p>Current news: there are TR attacks toward all PKK areas, in Syria and
Iraq, even the Iraqi gov joined in for attack on Sinjar. Trouble
around Idlib too.. Somebody is eager for a 'Tamil Tiger moment'.</p>
<p>Asia Minor incursion required KDP (Barzani family) help, and they are
helping, with cries of backstabbing, "Kurd against Kurd violence"
blame thrown at them.</p>
<hr />
<p>From TR standpoint, the more PKK was attacked the more it spread.
So war-war policy has been a fail so far.</p>

<p>Post Arab Spring PKK spread to Sinjar, near Syria (red cross in map),
helping anti-ISIS fight there, after the fight they stayed. Then they
linked with Syrian NE. Then the sister org there declared autonomy, 2017.

<p>Various paths from that Qandil mountain to TR; one from Iraq but they
cld easily enter through Iran, immediately cross the Iranian border,
go north and enter from there.. I'm sure they received a lot of help
from Iran over the years.</p>

<p>The darker green areas are Kurdish regions of Iraq, recognized by
central gov, with three governates, associated with two seperate
Kurdish Regional Gov families (north vs south), KDP and PUK. PKK
nestled itself at the intersection of three of these actors, KDP, PUK,
Iran, and on top of the hightest mountain of Iraq (the red dot).
KDP/PUK fought before, while in alliance now, doesn't hurt to
stay right between them for max leverage.</p>

<p>Why has the Kurdish terrorist group PKK active in TR been so difficult
