<p>First Post: "[W]e are talking about the..  reactor being completely
switched to uranium-plutonium MOX fuel. That reactor is standing at
the Beloyarsk nuclear power station, placed in the Urals mountains at
the border between Europe and Asia. The switch took several years, but
now the totally revolutionary reactor is giving power to consumers.</p>
<p>And that, my friends, means that Russia has achieved a closed circuit
of getting nuclear energy, asking for no raw materials like uranium
(or oil, or gas). That reactor works on the old stocks of spent
nuclear fuel, which is not just abundant, it will last us for several
thousand years. Oh, and in the future, there will be no such thing as
spent fuel, in need of stocking in some remote places. Every scrap of
it will be reprocessed..</p>
<p>Russia has been paid heavily by many nuclear powers to stock that
spent fuel, so now we have plenty"</p>

<p>If there's compounding in play, the resulting values of a measurement
are usually 'anormal'. With trade I'm sure countries build on existing
trades to bring in more, money pulls in more money, stuff just builds
on itself. </p>
<hr />
<p>.. which is the definition of average... But, the statement only works
if the value is distributed normally (Gaussian, bell curve). With
things such as wealth, and as we saw, trade, half the values are not
below (or above) average.</p>
<p>Steven Wright: ‚ÄúHalf the people you know are below average.‚Äù </p>
<hr />
<p>The crazy part is not who's on the trade map, but who isn't. In the
filtered map (of big traders) there is a massive contiguous block of
countries that have no lines going into them. The block starts from
Romania, Serbia goes to East to Pakistan, Afghanistan, in the South to
the entirety of Africa, in the North to Finland and Norway.</p>
<hr />
<p>US-CH, US-MX, US-CA trade rels are all half a <em>trillion</em> USD worth. US
clearly wanted deep trade ties with the two, did 90s NAFTA with CA,MX.
CH is halfway around the world, but the trade was just as high.</p>

<p>This fact is so obvious that coal mining accident data before/after
regulation is used as a pedestrian example in statistics - in the
subject of change point analysis. You look at the distribution of
accidents and try to find where distribution shifts from one to
another. Most methods will find a value near 1887 which is exactly
when Coal Mines Regulation Act of 1887 was passed.</p>

<p>Animal fat is great - it's healthy, and necessary. Cultivated animal
fat is even better, without the destructive farming side effects.</p>
<p>"[Startup Hoxton Farms' process] begins by taking a 'harmless handful
of stem cells' from an animal such as a cow or pig and placing them
inside a freezer. There is then enough supply of these cells which
means the animal is no longer needed...Similar to the equipment used
in a brewery, these cells are encouraged to multiply in a cultivator
which then kickstarts the production process [of animal fat]"</p>

<p>It is said new admisson and unanimity issues go hand in hand. Can't
admit new members if existing members are wary they'd hold off
important decisions with their vote.. To get over the deadlock, voting
scheme can be changed. Although I admit I enjoy seeing Hungary partly
holding off hare-brained schemes like the EU sanctioning itself into a
recession, with majority voting maybe such issues can get solved
differently, who knows? There might be countries now who are letting
Hungary play the bad guy, go along with stupid, while keeping a low
profile. They might act differently under a different scheme.</p>

<p>It's easy to create singularity in math. $f(x) = 1/x$. There. I just
created a singularity at $x=0$. The function is undefined there. Does
that mean there is a black hole at $x=0$?</p>
<hr />
<p>To detail, if your spiffy new model shows a 'singularity' at a point
it doesn't mean there should be a black hole there. Equation is likely
wrong, should be corrected so it has no singularity. In measurements
the instruments never spit out a 'singularity measurement'. Whereever
you point to, there is always a measurement.</p>
<hr />
<p>Math models do not lose accuracy, at first, due to discretization
(that comes later). They lose accuracy because math models
"oversmooth". You are representing phenomena based on finite particles
with something that works at infinitely fine scale. The tool helped us
for a long time, we could not (and still can't) simulate all particles
to compete with nature, math allowed scientists to research phenomena
without having a computer as big as nature. But we need to remember
it's all an (oversmoothed) approximation.</p>
