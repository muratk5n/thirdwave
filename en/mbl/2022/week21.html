<p>H2 View: "Three projects in Chile could double world electrolyser
capacity.. The Government organisation signed three agreements with
GNL Quintera, CAP SA, and Air Liquide, to develop the first
industry-scale green hydrogen production plants in Chile.</p>
<p>The three projects, set to launch in December 2025, are part of six
projects selected by Corfo in December 2021 and are hoped to bring
$1bn in investments and produce 45,000 tonnes of hydrogen a year"</p>

<p>H2 View: "Planned for Oman’s.. Free Zone, [a new] project will
integrate renewable power from solar, wind and storage; production of
hydrogen by electrolysis; production of nitrogen by air separation;
and production of green ammonia...</p>
<p>CEO at Air Products, said, 'We are delighted and honoured to work with
the government of Oman to develop this multibillion-dollar project,
which would be similar to the world-scale green hydrogen project we
are implementing with our partners in NEOM in the Kingdom of Saudi

<p>Need to treat electricity like the plague. Play whack-a-mole with
it. Whenever it is generated, use it and make it go away; quash
it. Run it through an electrolyzer, produce H2, then send the gas over
the pipeline, done. Or convert to ammonia, ship it overseas on large
ships. The longer energy stays in this inefficient form, the worse it
is.</p>
<hr />
<p>The grid 'cannot take it' because it is defective, inferior
technology. Need to transmit molecules (renewable gas), and convert to
electricity as required within cities. The crux of all storage,
transmission, and even end-use needs to be based on molecules. It will
be more <a href="twimg/EvdKNhvXAAE9Rr2.png">efficient</a>

Zohouri: "The need to reduce CO2 emissions has pushed
towards creation of new 'clean' electricity production paths, such as
photovoltaic or wind power, with hydropower still in use. Although the
number of facilities has exploded mostly because of subsidies, these
facilities now allow for a significant production of renewable
electricity, which can reach more than 50% of total electricity
production, depending on the country and weather conditions.</p>
<p>Electricity production unfortunately has a major drawback:
variability. Mainly depends on meteorological conditions such as wind
and sunshine. Even if forecasts are fairly accurate, production maxima
do not always coincide with consumption, resulting in higher than
demand production; hence, there arises the need to be able to store
this excess electricity for later use, regardless of its form...</p>
<p>What technology should be used to store this excess electricity? The
first solution that comes to mind is batteries. Although some have
relatively large storage capacity, costs and limited lifetime do not
allow for large-scale use. Other solutions exist, but all are limited
in their storage capacity, compared to expected surpluses.</p>
<p>Apart from direct storage of electricity, the other approach is to
convert it into another form to be able to store it. This is where
electrolysis comes into play, i.e. conversion to hydrogen and oxygen,
hence the name power-to-gas"</p>

<p>Fusion, of course, is nothing new. The sun has been at it for the last
few billion years and is still going strong, producing vast amounts of
energy..  The fundamental fact [is].. that fusing two hydrogen nuclei
together is hard. They are both positively charged particles and
therefore mutually repulsive...</p>
<p>In contrast, Hawker and his crew have come up with a radically
different approach to pulling off fusion and “getting it done” sooner
too. “Projectile fusion” as practised at First Light, in comparison
with “magnetic confinement fusion” is simpler, cheaper...</p>
<p>Hawker has taken the concept of the pistol shrimp – or the shrimp’s
claw – and converted it into an extremely long pistol, a light gas
gun, with a barrel 22m long, that propels a projectile at around 7km/s
into a cube of fusion fuel, turning it into thermal plasma, which is
so dense that it approaches the density of the core of the sun. When
the projectile hits the outer layer of the cube it produces a shock
wave bubble – just like the shrimp – that then compresses the fusion
fuel and under huge pressures and very high temperature for a
billionth of a second causes ions to fuse and release energy"</p>

<p>RU appears to have good intel; not just satellite, SIGINT, but leaks
from UKR mil as well. When the "sniper king" Wali went to UKR, he says
nearly got his ass blown up by tanks on first mission, it sounded like
they specifically targeted his area, which means knew he was
there. Right afterwards RU declared him dead (nearly true). My guess
is Wali's location was leaked and RU went after him - for a quick
propaganda win. Now, that kind of intel indicates HUMINT; UKR mil is
leaking like a sieve. Maybe that's not surprising, UKR could have a
lot of RU symphatizers.</p>

<p>You fight artillery with artillery. Also with airbombing, but Ukraine
does not air superiority, Russia does. They can take out rival
artillery units from the air, if not overpower the ones on the ground
with their own ground units (have better numbers, and their supply
line is closer and more secure, right over the border whereas
Ukraine's logistic situation is harder).</p>

<p>All finite-amount crypto is essentially right-wing. Money invariably
has politics associated with it. Crypto proponents think they can
sidestep all that with 'some bits', but that is extremely naive; money
never existed disconnected from a social order.. Gold was <em>made</em> into
money through kings (they demanded taxes be paid to them in currency
made from gold, silver, creating demand for those currencies).  Such
metals had no intrinsic value, at least nothing at the level that
primes them to be <strong>the</strong> money.</p>
<hr />
<p>It's not surprising the ultra-rich like the current incarnation of
digital cash, "crypto" - they are based on finite amount money base,
so rich ppl figure if "I put my money in this thing it won't
depreciate it will maintain its value through scarcity".</p>

<p>NYT: "All Those Celebrities Pushing Crypto Are Not So Vocal
Now.. Enthusiasm for crypto from Hollywood celebrities and top
athletes reached a fever pitch over the past year. On social media,
during interviews and even in music videos, they portrayed virtual
currency as a world with its own hip culture and philosophy — one that
was more inclusive than traditional finance and that involved the
chance to make loads of money.The Super Bowl was nicknamed the “Crypto
Bowl” this year because so many ads — which cost as much as $7 million
for 30 seconds — featured the industry, several of them starring
boldface names.But after investors watched hundreds of billions of
dollars disappear in a sell-off this month, those famous boosters now
face intensifying criticism that they helped drive vulnerable fans to
invest in crypto without emphasizing the risks. Unlike clothes or
snacks or many other products hawked by celebrities, the crypto market
is volatile and rife with scams"</p>

would matter to them but at what cost.</p>

proposal to build a dedicated artificial island in the North Sea, for
large-scale green hydrogen production, called ‘Brintø’. Brintø, Danish

towards Denmark’s ambitious hydrogen strategy, with its ability to
supply up to 1 million tonnes of green hydrogen per year once at full
capacity of 10GW..</p>
<p>CIP have suggested that Brintø could be operational by 2030, and could
prove to be a vital step in securing green energy supply for
