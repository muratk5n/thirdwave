<hr />
<p>To repeat, US sunshine states are CA, NV, UT, AZ, NM, CO, ID, WY. They
clearly have other resources too.. And perhaps expertise around
handling chemicals, storage, transport.</p>
<p>Once US catches momentum it will be like nothing anyone has ever

regional clean hydrogen hubs as they look to play pivotal roles in the

<p>Texas has a bright future, H2 production will be a boon for the state
just as oil had been. They have the sunshine and expertise in handling
various chemicals, transporting, storing, processing them.. If there

<p>You know once setup the Japanese will have a string of those ships
lined up, working around the clock, sailing back-to-back forming
almost a semi-pipeline through the sea, to get the H2 from
Australia. Massive energy transportation is possible, perhaps in

2040.. The first was a 313-foot container ship called the Mikage,
which sailed 161 nautical miles from Tsuruga Port, north of Kyoto, to
Sakai Port near Osaka. Upon reaching its destination port the ship was
even able to steer itself into its designated bay, with drones
dropping its mooring line.</p>
<p>The Mikage wasn’t purpose-built to be autonomous; the seven-year-old
ship was retrofitted with a system of sensors, cameras, and satellite
navigation. It followed a carefully-planned route while a control
centre on land monitored relevant wind, current, and weather data, as
well as details on nearby ships and potential obstacles.</p>
<p>Similar to how it’s easier for self-driving cars to operate
autonomously on highways than in unpredictable urban settings, the
Mikage didn’t have too hard of a time navigating itself through open
waters"</p>
