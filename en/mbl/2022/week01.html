<p>Heliogen went public recently. They received $39 million grant from
DOE, steel maker ArcelorMittal invested. </p>
<p>On the residential / industrial division: homes would still receive
CSP power through their tech operated by utilities, so people will
benefit, there is no need to install an entire solar farm in their
backyard. CSP's focus is massive scale, availability, and that's good,
much benefit to derive from that, eg at night they use power stored in
molten salt to run 24/7, something PV solar cannot do.</p>

<p>I checked the data, Granger causality shows the two-year treas affects
FEDFUNDS little more than the other way around. Both sides would
follow eachother closely to gauge reaction to events, but since for
bonds inflation is a major risk, they can't not rise (in yields) in
response to rising inflation. In turn the overnight borrowing rates
between banks cannot be neutral to that (read: FEDFUNDS), they'd lose
money on a daily basis. So FED wld be forced to follow the bond
market.</p>

<p>"It has happened again. Microsoft and Nvidia have built [NN] three
times the size of GPT-3, the former holder of the title. However, in
contrast with GPT-3, this new model hasn’t caused any commotion,
neither in the press nor in the AI community. And there’s a reason for
that...</p>
<p>Do we really need yet another biggest neural network?.. What are the
consequences of following the path of scaling models ad infinitum —
for the AI community in particular, and the world in general? Wouldn’t
it be better if we gave more space to other approaches to AI and
artificial general intelligence (AGI)?..</p>
<p>[NN based Large language model] LLMs have been recently entitled
'foundation models' by dozens of Stanford researchers. They argue that
these ever-larger neural networks comprise “an emerging paradigm for
building artificial intelligence systems.” But not all AI experts
agree with this fancy title.</p>
<p>Jitendra Malik, a professor of computer science at Berkeley says that
'the term ‘foundation’ is horribly wrong.' Adding, 'The language we
have in these models is not grounded, there is this fakeness, there is
no real understanding.' Mark Riedl, a professor at the Georgia Tech
School said on Twitter that “branding very large pre-trained neural
language models as 'foundation' models is a brilliant .. PR stunt.”..</p>
<p>But 'foundation models' isn’t the only title the AI community has
given to LLMs. In a paper dating March 2021 Emily M. Bender, Timnit
Gebru, and others called these models 'stochastic parrots.'"</p>

<p>One way to look at the Matrix movies is as small, muted, centrist
shitlib protests..  The system is not changed bcz these people are
fine with it as it is, they merely want to be "recognized" in it, to
be its The One (which everyone can beee if you belieeeeve), so they
can fly over it, be "loud and proud" while they enjoy a simplistic
diversity around them, and "represent". Strangely similar ending to
<em>Jupiter Ascending</em> (same director), the cleaner girl discovers she is
space royalty, then "saves Earth" with her "diverse" new boyfriend /
soldier, but returns, stays as a cleaner, while once in a while flies
over the city to enjoy her specialness and uniqueness. People are not
being harvested but have no idea what happened, things stay the same</p>
<p>#thematrix</p>

<hr />
<p><em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>; good to see the lead actors again, movie
had some good ideas.. but if there are no "reboot sequels", the
situation is no different than at the end of the first movie. Then
it's like what's the point? After the first, most expected the
destruction of the "system". The absence of that ending sapped the
energy of the sequels, wout courage they ended up as neutered, cheap
war movies with a few memorable action scenes</p>
