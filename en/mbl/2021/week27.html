<p>To sum, the mere existence of these types means <em>less</em> for the rest.</p>
<p>Acemoglu: "In this paper we develop a new perspective on the
establishment of the monopoly of violence and the formation of the
state. We build a model to explain the incentive of central states to
eliminate non-state armed actors (paramilitaries) in a
democracy... Since paramilitaries naturally have preferences over
policies, when they choose to become involved in politics, this may
reduce the incentives of the politicians they favor to eliminate
them. The model predicts that in non- paramilitary areas policies are
targeted to citizens while in paramilitary areas they cater to the
preferences of paramilitaries. This implies that in paramilitary areas
citizens obtain fewer public goods"</p>

<p>Good Haiti comparison w Dominican Republic (right next door). </p>
<p>Acemoglu: "Why is Haiti so poor?.. Haitians shocked the world with a
formidable slave revolt in 1791, ultimately leading to independence
from France. But this revolt did not lead to the development of
inclusive institutions. To start with, the fight against the French,
who attempted to retake their prize colony several times, was
protracted and costly. Dubois, for example, argues that the fiscal
needs imposed by this continued war made the abolition of slavery
essentially impossible. It probably also stunted the subsequent
political development of this new independent state by excessively
militarizing its politics. But perhaps more important was the vicious
circle of extractive institutions"</p>

<p>CNN: "Haiti President Jovenel Moise assassinated in attack on his residence"</p>
<hr />
<p>Open Source Guru, Hintjens: "I‚Äôm writing this in late 2011. In March,
Microsoft paid Nokia about 1 billion dollars for a deal that gave
Microsoft access to Nokia‚Äôs patents. A little later, HTC bought S3 for
300 million dollars, to get access to S3‚Äôs patents, mainly because
Microsoft and Apple were attacking it. Then in July, a group of firms
(Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, RIM, Sony, EMC, Ericsson) paid 4.5 billion
dollars for a set of patents from Nortel. Google bid somewhat less,
and lost the auction. In October, Sony paid 1.45 billion dollars for
Ericsson‚Äôs patent portfolio. Then in November, Google got Motorola
Mobility, and its patents, for 12.5 billion dollars.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs staggering here is that in 2011, firms paid about 20 billion
dollars for patent rights. In 2010, Apple spent 1.8 billion dollars in
R&amp;D. Google spent about 4 billion dollars. The total for the whole
software industry can‚Äôt be much more than that 20 billion dollars...</p>
<p>The patent wars for one segment of technology are costing as much as
R&amp;D into the future of all software technology combined"</p>
