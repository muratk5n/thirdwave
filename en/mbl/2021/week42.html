<p>Literally ran that code while writing this post. So right now 25 mil
ratings, for 58K movies, by anonymous 280K users are in notebook's
memory. This is not a drill. We have some fine computing capabilities
compared to even few decades ago..</p>
<hr />
<p>How to? Full zip file is <a href="https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/">here</a>,
unzip, then for example read all ratings with,</p>
<pre><code class="python">from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
import pandas as pd
r = pd.read_csv(&quot;ratings.csv&quot;)
m = csr_matrix((r.rating, (r.userId , r.movieId)))
</code></pre>

<p>Let's check the rating of user Id 2 for movie Id 2707</p>
<pre><code class="python">m[2,2707]
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">Out[1]: 3.5

<p>Algo chose this movie by [geek] reducing the user-movie rating matrix
through singular value decomposition and searching in the reduced
space for users matching my record, and recommending their top liked
movies. Since the matrix is sparse <code>csr_matrix</code> can be used, speeds up
the process [/geek].</p>

<p>The fluidic theories of course need to be tied to the rest of phy. An
advice to their theoreticians while they do that; feel free to ignore
parts of "known physics" as needed. Much of recent physics is a mess..

matter?". That "cosmic background" could well be misinterpreted

<p>An air bubble in water rises up to surface.. There is more pressure at
the bottom of it than at the top. More pres at the bottom bcz more
fluid there relative to top, more weight, creating pressure
difference.</p>
<p>If space is seen as fluidic, planet gravitational pull can be
explained similarly perhaps?  This fluid is extremely dense (according
to a yet unknown measure), denser further from bodies, and relative to
that planet bodies are like air, so "bubbles", ie other bodies are
pushed towards it, explaining the pull..? ðŸ¤”</p>

<p>Heat pumps are better than purely electrical (resistance) heating as
they use some gas inside, also clean, but will still cause an uptick
in electricity usage.. Depending on the price of electricity in a
country that can hurt budgets. Everything about electricity, from its
delivery, to its storage, is problematic. If renewable gas is piped
into homes it can simply upgrade gas boilers to use the new gas,
instead of natgas.</p>

<p>"[Berkeley] city council passed 'BerkDOT,' a first-in-the-nation
measure to shift traffic enforcement to unarmed Department of
Transportation workers. In the summer of 2020, cities across America
made similar commitments: to curtail the use of force, shrink police
budgets, and fund fleets of civilian officers. But Berkeley was the
first to target the traffic cop. By doing so, it is rethinking police
power at its root. Traffic stops are by far the most common reason
that police officers initiate contact with members of the public; they
account for 84 percent of encounters, according to data from the
Bureau of Justice Statistics. In fact, before cars, ordinary citizens
rarely came in contact with law enforcement. As we rebuilt cities
around the automobile, historians contend, drivers came to expect to
be policed. And communities of color have paid the highest price"</p>

<p>Holywood is obsessed with Batman.. There is an unending stream of
movies made abt the character.. They couldn't even wait for the dust
settle on the last actor (B. Affl), they immediately served a new
actor (the vampire guy).</p>
<p>I suspect propaganda. B. Wayne is rich (BAff version even said as much
in one movie when asked about his powers, answering with "I'm
rich"). BM in the comics is supposed to be an innovator himself, a
detective, but in recent incarnations his toys, BW glamor are more
front and center. The message is this; government is failing (in fact
it always fails, it can't not fail), trust the billionaire to solve
problems for you.</p>

<p>The presence of such massive supply at the consumer's doorstep can
spur development of more end-use products; eg carmakers they will
speed up FCEV production, we'll probably see more products around
portable canisters, etc. Supply is key. Aplenty will attract aplenty.</p>
<hr />
<p>H2 transition can be in stages; Gov can first encourage production,
and distribution of H2 to cities via pipelines. If homes do not have
CHP, gas heating units, then gas is converted to electricity at a
local hub, the last mile remains the same. Later as people convert
their units at home, they can get the gas directly from city pipeline.</p>

information can help you understand the post office, or FEMA, or name
it, any other government agency. Even as a grunt, we might dismiss it
being at the bottom of the hierarchy, but in many ways everything
revolves around the grunt, his ass needs to be carried to and from the
