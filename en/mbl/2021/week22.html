<p>The devoutness signal can also be used a means to stratify, create
hierarchy in society. If someone buys in, into something this out of
whack, which by the very nature of its whackiness <em>surely</em> leaves out
certain people, then you automatically are creating yourself an
"in-crowd". It's like a college fraternity, who is allowed in? The
pledge who puts panties on his head runs around half-naked screaming
"I am from outerspace" while riding a broom. That's the guy you want,
right? He is signaling he <em>really</em> wants to be in the club.</p>
<hr />
<p>Tigger national narrative being so broken creates many unwanted
side-effects. Because the narrative is bizarre, only the most devout
can buy into it wholesale. Then higher-ups can use that buy-in as a
signal, to weed out normals, allowing in fanatics. Those fanatics you
can direct anywhere, to your mafiatic organizations, extrajudicial
killings, whatever.</p>

<p>Grillo, <em>Pluralism and Politics of Difference</em>: "From the seventeenth
centuiy, [the Ottoman] <em>millet</em> [a system whereby peoples usually
grouped under religion, eg. Armenian millet] was 'probably current' in
the offices of the central government... In sum, then, <em>millets</em> were
institutions which were quite heavily organized at the top and at the
centre (in Istanbul) and thus 'existed' in some sense from the point
of view of the bureaucracy and their own leaders. In the towns and
villages of the provinces, however, the form of the institution, and
the degree of institutionalization varied greatly; in some places they
must scarcely have existed at all"</p>

<p>Assange story shows, MSM wasnt insterested, and bcz they weren't, ppl
werent either. </p>
<p>There is still a filtering mechanism, and they are at the center of
it. At least in the developed world where media isn't completely sold
out.. We want them to be better of course.</p>
<hr />
<p>G. Greenwald: "I remember [Assange] telling me the story that he
learned very early on which is when Wikileaks would get documents they
would put them on the Internet they wanted the entire public to be
made aware of them, and they would then contact journalists at the New
York Times the Washington Post, The Guardian, BBC and they would say
we have this incredibly explosive document sitting here, on the
Internet .. and no one was interested in it because they didn't think
it was exclusive..</p>
<p>That was why Wikileaks began partnering with the media in the Snowden
case when Edward Snowden came to us .. precisely because we weren't
part of the establishment press, but we realized .. that if we didn't
partner with long large media outlets it would be very easy for the US
government to demonize and stigmatize us as something other than
journalists. They would say we were hackers we were activists they and
so .. we partnered, and did the story with The Guardian, Laura did
hers mostly with the Washington Post some with Der Spiegel, and even
the New York Times and it gave a measure of protection.</p>
<p>So when I got this material in Brazil, and remember this is four
months after Bolsonaro got inaugurated, this huge right-wing movement
took over the entire country, he was at the peak of his power, we
didn't know what he was capable of doing in terms of press freedom. He
had sworn over and over that he would usher in dictatorship era
repression and I knew we needed the buy-in of the large Brazilian
media or we would easily be depicted not as journalists but as
criminals, especially since I'm not a Brazilian citizen despite living
in this country for 15 years.. we were able to partner with Folio of
Sao Paulo which is essentially the New York Times of Brazil the
largest newspaper in in the country"</p>
