<p>People vote on their well-being, will oscillate between choices, to a
certain extent guided by a rough ideology -- formed by what see in
front of them. They can choose, but they can't create choices. Like a
customer can choose between iPhone, or Android, or this car or that
car, but they can't create car. In the absence of a car, if you asked
them, they would want a faster horse carriage.</p>
<p>Thought leaders, then, must take steps to represent, politically, all
possible choices in the political sphere. These choices will naturally
emerge within the leading group, modernity allows only so many anyway,
and eventually a suitable palette is found. </p>

<p>How abt paying back the principal part...? Borrower still needs munee
for that, if sold assets you are back to the original problem.</p>
<p>Lender cld actually be selling the asset themselves, part of a stock
buyback scheme of borrower's company maybe (lender -usually a broker
too- sells the stock back to the company, not triggering any tax
requirement for the borrower, or the lender)?</p>
<p>"A pledged-asset mortgage [eg portfolio loan] is recommended for
borrowers that have the cash or investments available and don't want
to sell their investments to pay for the down payment. Selling the
investments might trigger tax obligations to the IRS...</p>
<p>The asset is merely collateral for the lender in the event of borrower
default. However, for the borrower, the pledged asset could help
considerably with gaining approval for the loan. Using the asset to
secure the note may let the borrower demand a lower interest rate on
the note then they would have had with an unsecured loan. Typically,
pledged-asset loans provide borrowers with better interest rates than
unsecured loans.</p>
<p>Once the loan is paid off and the debt is fully satisfied, the lender
transfers the pledged asset back to the borrower"</p>

<p>Snowden: "The first thing I do when I get a new phone is take it

two or three tiny microphones hidden inside, is only the first step of
an arduous process, and yet even after days of these DIY security
improvements, my smartphone will remain the most dangerous item I
possess..</p>
<p>I can’t help but regard the arrival of the Pegasus Project as a
turning-point—a well-researched, exhaustively-sourced, and frankly

<p>Why do I open source? U see what's going on inside, feel better. Or
bcz it's free, carry the code (and its associated skillset) from

<p>Open Source isn't some hold-hands-kumbaya approach to software
development. When I send a patch (or now create a 'pull request') to a
project to fix a bug, or to improve something, I do it for selfish
reasons. I want those changes in there so next time I get the latest
code from that project I get the new stuff plus my changes. I
obviously do this for project whose code I need.</p>

<p>"[I]f you follow the [GR] equations back in time, general relativity
eventually stops working. Therefore, no one presently knows how the

difficult their task becomes...</p>
<p>The miserable status of today’s theories for the early universe makes
me wonder whether it has already happened. Cosmologists have hundreds
of theories, and many of those theories come in several variants. It’s
not quite as bad as in particle physics, but the situation is similar
in that cosmologists, too, produce loads of ill-motivated models for
no reason other than that they can get them published. (And they
insist this is good scientific practice. Don’t get me started.)..</p>

<p>"Dark matter is an example of a research program that used to be
progressive but has become degenerative. In its original form, dark
matter was a simple parameterization that fit a lot of observations –
a paradigmatic example of a good scientific hypothesis. However, as
David Merritt elucidates in his recent book 'A philosophical approach
to MOND', dark matter has trouble with more recent observations, and
physicists in the area have taken on to accommodating data, rather
than making successful predictions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the abundance of specific particle models for dark matter
that physicists have put forward are unnecessary to explain any
existing observations. These models produce publications but they do
not further progress. This isn’t so surprising because guessing a
specific particle from rather unspecific observations of its
gravitational pull has an infinitesimal chance of working.</p>
<p>Theories for the early universe or fifth forces suffer from a similar
problem. They do not explain any existing observations. Instead, they
make the existing – very well working – theories more complicated
without solving any problem"</p>
