...which intends to play a critical role in the context of the
European Green Deal and the climate activities of the European
Union. Many Member States have already earmarked more than 45 billion
Euros in their respective national hydrogen strategies. Public funding
will need to be blended with private investment in order to guarantee
long term market structures. Nicolas is perfectly suited to boost the

<p>"The United States went to war in Vietnam for multiple reasons but the
basic reason was Charles De Gaulle. The American strategy at the time
was to contain the Soviet Union with a string of alliances swinging
from Norway all the way through [Vietnam], and blocked them through
expanding [alliances]. Charles de Gaulle came along and said "you
can't trust the americans because if they ever attacked the Americans
wouldn't come ...  you you're going to be left alone we have to form
our own NATO independent of the United States". During the Vietnam War
there's a word that became incredibly important <em>credibility</em>.
Credibility meant that how credible were the American guarantees to
this all-important structure of containment, how credible was it that
we would come to Germany's aid, or Japan's aid with everything we had,
if they were a war. And a terrible fear that time was that these
people would lose confidence in us. So part of the reason we went to
Vietnam had nothing to do with Vietnam the fear was that if we didn't
go to Vietnam our credibility with our other allies would be gone and
the entire American strategy will collapse on that basis. There was no
expectation [we would end up with] 50,000 dead, on that basis the
expectation was that we would go into a small police action we may win
it, we may lose it, but the Germans would know that our guarantee
means something"</p>

<p>Yes. And inflation is a major risk for bonds / treasuries, the pricing
of which reflects the market's perception of future inflation, and
indirectly growth (growth =&gt; rising wages =&gt; more money in
circulation, inflation).</p>
<p>"Inflation will also affect interest rate levels. The higher the
inflation rate, the more interest rates are likely to rise. This
occurs because lenders will demand higher interest rates as
compensation for the decrease in purchasing power of the money they

<p>"The H-Factor" üëç</p>
<p>"In a grand, clean energy strategy published in mid-December, a brain
trust of cross-sector Canadian savants predicted that hydrogen-powered
locomotion‚Äîalready nicknamed ‚Äúhydrail‚Äù‚Äîwould be ready for testing some
time about 2025, first in the form of yard switchers, short-leashed to
their refueling stations.</p>
<p>The very next day, Dec. 18, Canadian Pacific (CP) smashed that
timeline, and woke the North American rail industry"</p>

<p>Some early Zack Snyder buzz, on the Justice League recut (?) (soon to

<p>It's good.. keeping the fans happy. I hope new JL pans out.</p>

<p>Average surface elevation of Earth is 840 meters... most know "sea

<p>Newton, other early modern phy computed all the time. It's fine to go
off in an abstract direction but most phy teaching by default must be
enmeshed with computation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Landau wrote some fantastic books. Id listen to him.</p>
<p>Landau: "There can be little argument that computation has become an
essential element in all areas of physics, be it via simulation,
symbolic manipulations, data manipulations, equipment
interfacing... [E]ven though the style of teaching and organization of
subjects being taught by physics departments have changed in recent
times, the actual content of the courses has been slow to incorporate
the new-found importance of computation. Yes, there are now speciality
courses and many textbooks in Computational Physics, but that is not
the same thing as incorporating computation into the very heart of a
modern physics curriculum so that the physics being taught today more
closely resembles the physics being done today"</p>
<hr />
<p>Creator is <a href="../../0119/2015/04/god.html">more likely</a></p>
<p>"Which is likely? Creator or not?"</p>
<hr />
<p>By turning something into a process, we dont automatically remove "an
omnipotent creator" from the picture. Everyone likes the invention of
evolution. "God did not create the final thing, it was an evolutionary
process". Boom. Darwin is world famous.</p>
<p>"Well now let's apply that to the universe".. thought some? "God did
not make it happen, it started from a small seed, turned into
everything we see"</p>
<p>Except the creator isnt exactly removed from the picture, ie the most
enthusiastic supporters of Big Bang were and are the Clergy. That one
one focused, 'big' creational event must have jelled more with their
view of the creator.</p>
<p>But an omnipo being can bring stuff into existence, close to what they
are now, just as easily as some magic process that will evolve stuff
into as they are now. Dont want to assume either way, what I am saying
is opting for long-running process just to remove the Big Guy is not
necessarily more scientific.</p>
