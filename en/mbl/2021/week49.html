<p>A child could deduce the Sun is liquidic. We know the Sun's

get Sun's mass. Sun's volume is easy, even optically we can determine

density. That density my friend will be close to water's density. Good

<p>The Atlantic: "So what work is actually valuable? It’s incredibly
unclear. Many knowledge workers, ourselves included, find themselves
insecure in some capacity about the work they’re doing: how much they
do, whom they do it for, its value, their value, how their work is
rewarded and by whom. We respond to this confusion in pretty confusing
ways. Some become deeply disillusioned or radicalized against the
extractive, capitalist system that makes all of this so muddled. And
others throw themselves into work, centering it as the defining
element of their self-worth. In response to the existential crisis of
personal value, they jump on the productivity treadmill, praying that
in the process of constant work they might eventually stumble across
purpose, dignity, and security... The treadmill rarely provides the
kind of value and meaning that we hope it will. People are growing
more certain in the notion that the status quo of American working
life is untenable. But the pandemic has created an opportunity to
reconsider and reimagine the structure of our lives and, perhaps,
remove the vestigial, extractive elements. We believe that flexible
work—not flexible work during a pandemic, not flexible work under
duress—can change your life"</p>

<p>"Never mind that in the three years that had passed since the
withdrawal [from the Iran nuclear deal], Trump’s strategy was, on its
own terms, clearly not succeeding: Renewed and increased sanctions on
Iran — dubbed “maximum pressure” — had not forced Tehran to capitulate
and negotiate a better deal, nor had the economic damage to the
Islamic Republic led to its overthrow by a restless public. To
Israel’s possible surprise, moreover, Trump never followed through on
threats to strike Iran directly despite growing nuclear violations and
multiple attacks against Washington’s regional allies.</p>

<p>Hypersonics are not a panacea.. Every capability invites its defense,

the homeland more likely.</p>

<p>$\sin^{\prime}(x)=\cos(x),\quad$
$\sin^{\prime\prime}(x)=-\sin(x),\quad$,

<p>"Synlight: Researchers expect that within 10 years, Concentrated Solar
Power (CSP) can be used to split water to hydrogen chemically using
the world’s desert sun... light is concentrated on a demonstration
system containing a cerium oxide lattice. If steam is led into the
reaction chamber, the oxygen it contains will combine with the metal
at around 800 °C and will be absorbed by it, so that hydrogen is the
only product left. Hoffschmidt said that the gas was 'an alchemist’s
dream,' as 'this high-energy fuel can be used to create virtually
anything.'"</p>
