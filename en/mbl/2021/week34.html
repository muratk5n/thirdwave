<p>Insect protein? Have insects eat food waste (before it emits methane)
and then turn insects into flour, protein powder? Interesting. First
'insect protein' is bad marketing, they should be stressing this
flour, powder thing. Technically though it is cleaner to have plant,
lab-grown meat proteins, producing massive meal replacement powders,
which by definition, will have zero or no waste. Add water through
desalination (w better, cheaper approaches), through clean prenewable
energy, we are in the green.</p>
<hr />
<p>It isnt like "US lost and others (in the region) won" due to the
pullout. AFG neighbor countries are worried.. I was watching troop
movements (through gdelt scans), almost all surrounding countries
deployed troops to their AFG border as pullout neared. Some countries
in the region are worried. US was providing a security service of
sorts to all neigboring countries there.</p>

<p>Dude watches the moves of big dogs, true, their P/FCF ratios are fukked.</p>
<p>P/FCF = Market Cap / Free Cash Flow. It is a measure of whether market
cap is justified by the cash flow a company generates. Checking Shopify,
comparing against Microsoft, Google</p>
<pre><code class="python">import yf
atts = [&quot;Market Cap (intraday)&quot;,&quot;Free Cash Flow&quot;]

MSFT ['Market Cap (intraday): 2.29T', &quot;Free Cash Flow: ('56,118,000', '56,118,000', '45,234,000')&quot;]
GOOG ['Market Cap (intraday): 1.84T', &quot;Free Cash Flow: ('58,536,000', '42,843,000', '30,972,000')&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>Ratios</p>
<pre><code class="python">print ('SHOP %d' % ((181*1e9) / (506.0*1e6)))
print ('MSFT %d' % ((2.29*1e12) / (56.0*1e9)))

<p>Shopify cap is 357 TIMES of its (trailing twelve month) cash
flow. You'd have to wait &gt;300 YEARS to reach the market valuation of
this company with the cash it generates.</p>
<p>In comparison MSFT, GOOG have lower P/FCF, can generate cash.</p>

<p>Even if there is a single soldier there, that steals valuable

<p>Most CC today is badly designed but an ideal one (like a left-wing

change would be drastically different. How different is different? See
the monumental shift from agrarian to industrial England. If one lived
back then, there'd come a time, within a span of ~50 yrs, before /
after of the place would look completely different. Before would be
carriages, slow life, hand-sewn clothing, after, train, steam ships,
manufactured clothing, much faster life. Radical change. Day and

<hr />
<p>H2 fuel is that rare and ingenious solution.. It swaps one fuel for
another, so all kinds of distribution, central management,
concentration dynamics can apply as-is (along w people who make money
from it). At the same time, new fuels can support off-grid,
self-sustained living, see Lavo in Australia. Here renewable fuel
works for 3W.</p>
