<p>Vague, <em>A Brief History of Doom</em>: "The iconic structures of American
skylines form the silhouette of the Great Depression: New York’s
Chrysler Building, Empire State Building, and RCA Building; Chicago’s
Merchandise Mart, Wrigley Building, and Tribune Tower; Philadelphia’s
PSFS Building; Los Angeles’s City Hall; Dallas’s Cotton Exchange
Building; Detroit’s Fischer Building; and Houston’s Gulf
Building. These are enduring architectural feats of the 1920s,
vestiges of the real estate eruption that came before the fall. Many
were speculative projects, unsupported by actual real estate demand;
begun toward the end of the 1920s, when loans were still available;
and finished after the crash, when lenders had little choice but to
make funds available to complete construction or else see their entire
loan go bad. None was financially successful for its original
investors. They remained partly or largely empty for a decade or more
after completion, as would hundreds of others"</p>

<p><em>The Time Machine</em>, 2002 is about taking a stand IMO. The prof loses
his wife, tries to save her by going to past, fails. Then he "escapes
to the future", keeps going further and further in time, and during
stops he sees one catastrophe after another. One way to see that
future was bad bcz prof wasnt in their history. See? The library
assist prog did not know abt time travel tech waay ahead, so his
science had not been reinvented after him. Of course this is unlikely
the non-fictional world, techniques are discovered simultaneously by
many. But allowing this 1 artistic license, this cld be the
message. And only after prof starts fighting for <strong>a</strong> present (the
idyllic place) things start to improve. Could not save his wife, but
could help some, a certain time period.</p>

<p>Not everything needs to be fun, or "visibly fun" as seen from
outside. Electricity is fun and interesting, there are sparks,
current, voltage wooohooo! But it is an inefficient way of delivering
energy.</p>
<p>If we overly focus on the "fun stuff", we are making a pedagogical
mistake, plus might burden / condemn the next generation to
inefficient, bizarre solutions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Here is what's wrong with the current science - scifi
relationship.. There are many solutions to Einstein's field
equations. There are many interpretations of quantum mechanics. But
out of all possible solutions and interpretations, mov and tv land
chooses the most flashy one, and sadly it chooses the same ones
consistently, then from the outside it looks like that direction is
the new direction of physics.</p>
<p>For example <strong>out of all solutions to Einstein's field equations</strong>,
movies choose the one that will give them wormholes, that way Loki and
Thor can come from Asgard and visit Earth. Or <strong>out of all possible
interpretations of QM</strong> they pick the one that gives them multiple
universes, that way actors can play their doppelganger with a goatee
visiting from a different universe.</p>

<p>Graeber: "[P]roductive jobs have, just as predicted, been largely
automated away. (Even if you count industrial workers globally,
including the toiling masses in India and China, such workers are
still not nearly so large a percentage of the world population as they
used to be.)</p>
<p>But rather than allowing a massive reduction of working hours to free
the world’s population to pursue their own projects, pleasures,
visions, and ideas, we have seen the ballooning not even so much of
the “service” sector as of the administrative sector, up to and
including the creation of whole new industries like financial services
or telemarketing, or the unprecedented expansion of sectors like
corporate law, academic and health administration, human resources,
and public relations. And these numbers do not even reflect all those
people whose job is to provide administrative, technical, or security
support for these industries, or, for that matter, the whole host of
ancillary industries (dog washers, all-night pizza deliverymen) that
only exist because everyone else is spending so much of their time
working in all the other ones"</p>
<hr />
<p>At the very least weekly working days need to be reduced down to 4.
Not even during hunter-gathering era, when humans literally had to go

<p>"Longer-term, a hydrogen pipeline network offers the most
cost-efficient means of distribution. For example, pipelines can
transmit 10 times the energy at one-eighth the costs associated with
electricity transmission lines and have capex costs similar to those
for natural gas. The industry can partially reuse existing gas
infrastructure, but even newly constructed pipelines would not be cost
prohibitive (assuming leakage and other safety risks are properly
addressed). For example, we estimate the cost to transport hydrogen
from North Africa to central Germany via pipeline could amount to
about USD 0.5 per kg of H2 – less than the cost difference of domestic
renewable hydrogen production in these two regions"</p>

<p>The filibuster was never in the constitution, originated mostly by
accident, and has historically been used to block civil rights. No
legislatures on earth have a supermajority requirement because that’s
stupid and paralyzing. It’s time to trash the Jim Crow filibuster"</p>

<p>UK vaccinated more than all of EU combined? First vaccine development
was partly based in Germany!  There are prod centers in Belgium! Were they
shipping it all to Britain? </p>

<p>I got vaccinated at the new FEMA site in Brooklyn today, and one thing
I didn’t expect was just how good it would feel seeing the kind of
mass public mobilization that’s been missing for the last year ...</p>
<p>The site is running like clockwork and just cranking through the
vaccinations, must've done hundreds in the 15 mins I was there. Was
staffed by a huge number of really delightful National Guard people
from all over the country - the people who gave me my shot were from
Georgia"</p>

<p>Our anatomy has largely remained unchanged in the past 300K years, so
yes, human history is much longer. </p>
<hr />
<p>Hah.. says "fig as old as humanity itself".. Another case of confusing
agro history with real history. We lived thousands of years before
this age.. doesnt that count? (Fig is only 5000 yrs old)</p>

<p>They have their stashhhhh, yeeeaaa.. they took their fill, they
stashed it, now they want its value to be maintained for that
stash. That's why they are "stans", and most are also "gold permabulls", is
it called?  Goldcucks? Sorry, goldbugs?</p>

<p>The unemployment measurement problem was known at the FED, among the
various branches, at highest levels. Another Komlos paper
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3467994">here</a>
talks about alternative measurements proposed by the officials
themselves over the years.</p>
