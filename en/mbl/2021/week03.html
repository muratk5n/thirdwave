<p>Combining H2 with CO2 (from the "air") to create synthetic kerosone,
so overall you are carbon neutral (took from air, goes back to air, no
difference)? Too open to cheating.. They'll take CO2 from f-ing
whereever, and slap a "neutral" label on it. Before VW cheating
scandal I might have supported these neutrality schemes, now, no.. The
best way to go green is commiting to it at end-user level, you
regulate the source (or make it completely green as well) then the
rest is safe.</p>

Alaska? Or increase tank size little more.. Solutions can be found.</p>

<p>How to solve the green aviation problem?</p>
<p>Current jet fuel used is kerosene (one of the most densest form of
energy) w energy content 34.69 MJ/litre.</p>
<p>Liquified H2 has 8.5 MJ/liter</p>
<p>Then a suggestion could be, pending new developments, double fuel tank
size, and halve the range of planes. Dunno what else to say, greening
will have consequences. But I am guessing if sufficient fire is lit
under their ass, aircraft makers will innovate in a jif. Airbus chief

<p>Unzicker: "The reason why the standard model cannot calculate mass is
stunningly simple. Whatever formula may calculate the mass of a
particle, it has to have the physical unit of a mass, which is
kilograms, and those kilograms have to come out of the formula, you
can't pull it out of your ass. The only way to do it is to find
combinations of the fundamental constants of Nature, otherwise you are
cheating. But there is no such combination, as every high school kid
can understand... There is just one caveat - you can't do it unless
you use the gravitational constant G, that is, you consider gravity in
your model. But particle physicists don‚Äôt do it because gravity is a
difficult business that goes above their minds. It‚Äôs outright lunatic
that they declare that calculating masses, alas, is impossible in the
standard model and at the same time deliberately disregard gravity
which would offer the only possibility to try it"</p>

<p>"[Wilczek] has by now lost multiple bets that the LHC would see SUSY
particles, including ones with Garrett Lisi in 2009 and Tord Ekel√∂f in 2012.
At this point, even diehards like Wilczek acknowledge that
chances that the LHC will see SUSY are slim. Another problem is that
increasingly sensitive proton decay experiments have also ruled out a
large part of the proton lifetimes predicted by the SUSY models
Wilczek favors"</p>

<p>Boeing did not only mess up on the control system of the MAX. They
messed up in the core aerodynamics first, they created a poorly
balanced plane, which they tried to fix using software. They made it
much easier for the control system to fail, basically.</p>
<p>People are awed and amazed at the electronics of these systems, but
let's not forget, during WW1 and and 2, planes could still fly without
any of these. Basic, solid aerodynamics made that possible. Now bunch
of office monkeys too used to their gadgetry and unrealistic computer
games think they can turn everything upside down, and "software" wld
take care of it. This is delusional / wishful thinking. This is the
