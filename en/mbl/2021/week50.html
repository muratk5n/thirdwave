creating an env for "exercise nuts" when it didnt work was part of a
misplaced wave that happened (created) outside them as well, outside
the control of regular people. They, their parents followed that dumb
ass shit and ended up here. Now they should not pull out the
"intrusion" argument in the 11th hour when some are trying to fix the
problem for them. Many seem to forget they live in a modern world,
where concentrated, centralized forces roam.</p>

<p>Note the image of a rich person 200 yrs ago was someone fat (bcz sugar
was rare only the rich could afford it). Now the image of a rich
person is lanky, bcz the wealthy have access to better cooking,
ingredients (through chefs etc), read: less starch, more vegs. The
issue never was the amount eaten, or how much fat.</p>
<p>At the same time typical poor person now is likely to be fat; sugar
and starch has become so prevalent in the market that it is now
feeding (and killing) the poor.</p>

<p>But imo the ideology, its first inception, quickly <a href="../../2020/04/turks-culture-national-narrative.html#estagfurullah">fell out of
favor</a>,
stayed that way until well into the 20th century when Kemal and his
cohorts utilized, resurrected the same escapist fantasy to handle a
similar trauma. The empire was gone, and the new nation needed
something "different". The founders served up the nomadic Turk from
faraway lands, just like Nazis had dreamt up the Aryan from Atlantis.</p>
<hr />
<p>The claim is the Otto itself started the Turkist ideology partially in
the 15th century, before the "Grand Ancestor" Kemal. Otto had its ass
kicked back then by Temarlane from Central Asia, so historians
(propagandists) were attempting to say "yeah we are kinda like that
guy, we are from that region too".</p>
