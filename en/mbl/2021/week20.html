<h1>Week 20</h1>
<p>Jacobin: "If nothing else, the COVID-19 pandemic has been an
incredibly instructive case study in what the neoliberal dogma that
now governs our waking lives really means when stripped of artifice or
pretense. As things stand, just a handful of profit-driven private
companies currently control the knowledge and expertise required to
produce vaccines — with people in many poorer countries not expected
to be vaccinated until at least 2024. It didn’t have to be this way,
of course.</p>
<p>Enabled by a monopolistic global intellectual property (IP) regime and
with a tip of the hat to billionaire Bill Gates, Big Pharma and its
political allies have largely succeeded in controlling and defining
the narrative during the early vaccine rollout — transforming the
prospective solution to a global crisis into yet another occasion for
narrow corporate profit, in this case at the expense of public health
and a speedy end to the pandemic"</p>

<p>'Israel has a right of self-defense'. This commonsense statement is
repeated everywhere — by state officials and media outlets, by
commentators and anchors. It seems so basic and self-evident that it
is hard to argue with. But today Israel uses self-defense as its key
rhetorical tool for war. By invoking self-defense, Israel changes the
conversation from its colonial crimes against the Palestinians to the
injuries it has itself incurred as a result. Yet it is precisely
because Israel is denying Palestinians their human rights, including
the right of self-determination, that it cannot claim self-defense as
a legal justification for the use of force"</p>

<p>Al Jazeera: "In the beginning, the usual suspects from the left were
the only Israelis who said it out loud. Next was the former minister
of defence and chief of staff Moshe Yalon, who made the link between
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's personal interests and the violent
confrontation that started in East Jerusalem and spread to the Gaza
strip, the occupied West Bank and Israel. 'The security escalation
serves Netanyahu and Hamas, both for internal political reasons,'
tweeted Yalon. Then even former defence minister and chairman of
Yisrael Beitenu party Avigdor Lieberman declared that 'The strategic
purpose of the [military] operation is to improve the public opinion
of Netanyahu. As long as the mandate to form a government is with
Lapid, Netanyahu will try to extend the operation.'</p>
<p>Indeed, the incumbent Israeli prime minister has not made any
significant efforts to contain the violence. Last month, he could have
ordered the police to remove the roadblocks from Damascus Gate in the
old city of Jerusalem. Why did he wait until it became a battleground
between the police and hundreds of young Palestinians' Why did he
allow the police to throw stun grenades in Al-Aqsa mosque during
prayer times?"</p>

<p>"Amundsen experienced his first merciless taste of winter in the
Antarctic. Stuck onboard the Belgian expedition ship Belgica, which
was grounded in pack ice, he and the rest of the crew contracted
scurvy and faced certain death.That is when, according to a new book
published later this month, Amundsen started eating raw penguin meat 
and discovered a secret that would later give him a huge advantage
over Captain Robert Falcon Scott in the race to the south pole. 'If
you eat almost any kind of meat, as long as it's raw enough, you can
get the vitamin C that the body requires to avoid scurvy,' said Julian
Sancton, author of the forthcoming book, Madhouse at the End of the
Earth.This was the great insight, he said, of the Belgica's American
doctor, Frederick Cook. He had spent time among the Inuit and observed
that although their diet consisted largely of fresh game, they didn't
get scurvy"</p>

[blocking rotation] .. Is that too much to ask?..  [Th]e person
stopping me is actually the programmer behind the game’s physics
engine, because at the heart of each of these tasks lies an angular
effect. Few games today try even to model angular effects, let alone
try to get them right.</p>
<p>The main reason for the lack of support for angular (you might call
them rotational) effects in today’s games is that programmers perceive
angular physics to be difficult to understand and
implement. High-school physics courses (where we all learned F=ma)
usually don’t cover [them], and it’s not immediately clear
how to translate a force applied to an object into a spin for that
object"</p>

called a devastatingly lethal Israeli attack.... [MSM...] had

they had been turned into accessories to the military, why it had

<p>Jacobin: "Biden administration’s economic experts have been
spotlighting the basic facts showing that the economy is functioning
normally and private-sector pay has not unsustainably spiked. In fact,
average hourly earnings increased from March to April by less than the
rise in the consumer price index — which suggests there is less of a
worker shortage, and more a shortage of employers willing to increase
pay even a little bit. For his part, President Joe Biden has
thankfully shed his past Reagan-appeasing habits and has avoided
echoing his own old 'welfare queen' language. But ... his rhetoric is
now starting to subtly shift from calling out GOP bullshit to trying
to accommodate it"</p>
