harvesting the energy of high-altitude winds. At 1000 m altitude,
winds are about three-times faster than surface winds... Furthermore,
high winds are steadier and available almost all over the world,
unlike surface winds which are intermittent and only exploitable in
certain areas of the globe"</p>

<p>Moscow criteron..  interesting. </p>
<p>"[About UK doctrine 'Moscow criteron'] It has been the UK’s policy
that the independent British nuclear deterrent should be able to
defeat ballistic missile defences around Moscow. If the UK decided
alone to take the apocalyptic decision to use its nuclear weapons, it
would want to be able to target large centres of population such as
Moscow. Hiroshima and Nagasaki would be dwarfed by such events. The
rationale for this policy is that our independent deterrent has to
cover the possibility that, if the US decided for any reason not to
use its nuclear capability to defend Europe, the continent and the UK
in particular could defend itself"</p>

<p>NYT: "In the early days of the pandemic, when drug makers were just
starting to develop vaccines, placing orders for any of them was a
risk. Wealthier countries could mitigate that risk by placing orders
for multiple vaccines and, by doing so, tied up doses that smaller
countries may have otherwise purchased, according to experts.</p>
<p>As a result, most higher-income countries were able to pre-order
enough vaccines to cover their populations several times over, while
others had trouble securing any doses at all"</p>

<p>Yes students need to understand the individual pieces of every
approach and how they are put together (key to inno), not just learn
how to turn knobs on a ready-made black-box, prepackaged
solution. Demystify.</p>
<p>Professor: "The simulation of non-trivial practical problems in fluid
dynamics ... usually requires sophisticated tools. These tools often
come with many whistles and bells, are proprietary or difficult to
tinker with, modify the code and add to it.  Students with access to
these tools end up spending most of the time learning how to press
their many buttons and become technicians instead of professionals. It
is the experience of the author (in a similar field, Electrical
Engineering) that most of these technicians are laid off in their
thirties when the standard recession cycle hits the industry. Their
diplomas were not of much help. Expensive and proprietary software
tools have their place in the industry. Students in their formative
years at school should be able to write code, be able to read the code
written by others and modify, improve and expand it. Code, simulate,
debug and correct. This is the way to develop understanding and
intuition"</p>

<p>"Researchers have developed a cheaper and more efficient way to produce
hydrogen from water... [T]he new metal catalyst developed by this team
of researchers uses an alloy made of ruthenium and iridium, so that
both hydrogen and oxygen can be generated at the same time through
accelerating chemical reactions.</p>
<p>The alloy comprises of microscopic crystal sheets measuring just 3
nanometers thick. One nanometer is one-millionth of a millimeter.</p>
<p>Because it is so dense, the crystalline structure can be seen on its
surface, giving it an appearance similar to coral.</p>
<p>Ruthenium is a relatively cheaper material and it accounts for 94
percent of the catalyst’s composition, so the cost of the catalyst’s
metal ingredients can be reduced to a fraction of the cost of using a
combination of platinum and iridium oxide...</p>
<p>The team’s results suggest it is much more efficient than other
conventional methods that use the same voltage. Due to its high
reaction rate, this method can produce around 30 times the amount of
hydrogen, the researchers said"</p>

<p>We are not that used to the idea of China - Russia competition
lately. Most watchers argue about the 'alliance' and degree of
cooperation of the two. Sure, there's a lot of cooperation. But,
competition between the two is growing across the board. Neither
Moscow, nor Beijing like to talk about this too much publicly. One
evident example is Central Asia where China has long surpassed Russia
in terms of investment and overall economic engagement. Russia still
holds to the security role but it is being challenged by China
continuously.</p>
<p>Another telling example is Serbia. Russia's 'little sister' that is
becoming truly a battleground for Moscow and Beijing. China's trade
with Serbia is already surpassing Russia's, same goes for the
investment. China is challenging Russia as a main arms exporter.</p>
<p>And yet another story is Covid vaccine. We have a detailed text at
@RiddleRussia on this coming up later this week. China-Russia
competition is 'almost silent' but nevertheless growing. And it
