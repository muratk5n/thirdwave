<p>30s nationalism was beaten through war in Europe. TR branch wiggled
its way out of that loss.. They hid in the cracks of the society,
occasionally getting out and messing shit up. Zionists were already

criticized for anything, in fear of being called anti-Semite. That is
at least two countries today who harbor a rotten form of nationalism,

<p>Data can be noisy or missing (report delays, etc); so you try to piece
it together from clues. An aircraft carrier (code CVN) never travels
alone, it is accompanied by destroyers (code DG), and guided missile
cruisers (code CG). So CG and DG presence can indicate a larger deployment.</p>

Japan, and Vietnam / Singapore.</p>
