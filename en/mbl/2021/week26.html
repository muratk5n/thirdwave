<p>Many of the WWII participants avoid the "N-word", like US. If a word
in the neighborhood is rarely needed patriotism is used instead. Some
in Trump WH tried to bring it back, as in "economic natinoalism" but

<p>Institutions matter..  After the Tahrir protests and fall of Mobarak,
one of the few organized actors were the M. Brotherhood, which weren't
representative, nor experienced enough to lead Egypt anywhere. In fact
MB themselves were the result of the monkey show Mobarak put out there
to lull the West into thinking he had an opposition. But when MB
actually took power it was apparent they lacked the necessary support,
and culture to bring about change.. Then they were taken down by the
other institution more entrenched than theirs, the military, while the

<p>It was tried, results aren't good. See Tom Gowers' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project">polymath project</a>.
PM was a designed to be a "massively collaborative mathematical project" with
the goal of solving a research problem.. Throughout it all however, it
always seemed to me Gowers was doing more work keeping the thing
together than actually enjoying its results, he was putting more work
in than he was getting out basically.. so the project is a fail. On
focused work, you need focused expert(s) of similar stature, so they can
reach a fruitful result.. Creation requires intention. Only intention
can put together the necessary pieces to generate nonlinear power. Bunch of
jagoffs "coming together" in an ad-hoc fashion will not bring about
major change.</p>
