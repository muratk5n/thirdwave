<p>After Azeris took Karabakh region w TR help, Iranians suspected Israel,
and US motives behind it. Then TR-Paki-Azeri joint military drill
happened, then the Azeri tax on the Iranian trucks passing through
Karabakh. That road was apparenly a major trade route for the
Iranians, which the Azeris captured. Then Iran did exercise near AZ.</p>
<p>The situation can escalate to a proxy war, involving all the parties
listed. Maybe the war would be preferred by the US planners, Iran gave
US a hard time in Iraq, this wld be the payback, possibly leading to
toppling of Iranian regime, and completing the bigger plan triggered
by the invasion of Iraq. Dont care abt the f-ing mullahs but cld be
