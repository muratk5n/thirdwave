<p>"With the notion of systemic rivalry, the European Union hoped to
separate political differences and economic links. In strategic
rivalry, conflict leads. In systemic rivalry, conflict is limited to
the political sphere. It is part of the EUâ€™s political tradition to
believe that politics and the economy can be insulated from each
other...</p>
<p>Over the past two years, [the EU] approved a barrage of new
regulations limiting the Chinese stateâ€™s ability to interfere with the
framework of economic links between the two blocs. These include
investment screening, trade defense instruments, a package against
state subsidies and a public procurement tool...</p>
<p>The deal included significant concessions from Beijing, including a
greater level of market access and disciplines on state-owned
enterprises, transparency of subsidies and rules prohibiting forced
technology transfer. 'By giving us a big gift, they hoped to prevent a
united front with the Biden administration,' the official said.</p>
<p>What surprised China is that the EU never regarded the CAI as a
political agreement. Having forced Beijing to concede on key points,
the bloc did not hesitate to walk over Chinaâ€™s most salient red
lines. On March 22, the EU joined the U.K. and the U.S. in imposing
sanctions aimed at Chinese officials believed to be involved in human
rights violations in Xinjiang province"</p>
