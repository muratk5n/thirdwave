We’ve been lying about a shortage of scientists continuously since
Sputnik. We have too many scientists relative to our anemic level of
interest in paying for the basic research that created our modern
economy.

Why do we believe a >60YO lie? Because of who tells it.

Scientists.

Dalio: more education to fix poverty. Great solution, jackass. This guy cant even put five words together. He is in no position to be "generating ideas".

Yang's inexperience could be overlooked but his polsci "lay of the land" missteps cannot. He nearly did that circum. debate thing, that's a sign the campaign is ran by neophytes.

IDW intervened at the last second IMO and he got a respectable interview. Otherwise he was toast.

The idea for the original debate must have been planted "elsewhere", so Shapiro was probably bitchslapped from all directions.. That'd be hilarious to watch.

You see how these fuckers play the game though... U have to be alert. Very alert.

Saw an H2 catalyst paper, "Catalyst structure optimization for the
oxygen reduction reaction on Pt and Au".

There is a Github repo on it 

https://github.com/VlachosGroup/ORR-Optimization

Code looked like network / graph computation? 

Intrigued.

Replying to @dweinberger

Sloppy and loaded language. "Ethics" too quickly devolves into "*my* ethics", which devolves into politics and parochialism. Likewise for "justice".  And "should" is just lecturing, which tends drive people away

"ethics" I particularly dislike. U can reverse-engineer it from long-term self-interest. No need for the touch-feely.

Apple in 2019:

My spacebar double-spaces constantly.

I accidentally brush the "Esc" button on . the Touch . Bar several times a day.

The "Pause" button in the Touch Bar doesn't pause iTunes.

Once a day I have to run back to my office to get a dongle.

This isn't . progress.

Goldcucks dream abt a world that cannot be. Sound money isn't what u think it is.

---

Capital is not "allocated" in capitalism, it is _created_ while giving credit. Banks have no need for savings in order to lend. 

That's why it's moronic to talk abt the price of money for lending. Demand 4 money is infinite, so is the suppy (printing). It can't be priced.

Venezuella is actually strategically unimportant for US.

"Venezuela’s physical isolation—with the Amazon to the south, the Caribbean (dominated by the U.S. Navy) to the north, and a hostile and stable Colombia to the west, on the other side of mountains and jungle—renders the country otherwise irrelevant" - Friedman

Rickards, and other "goldcucks" sorry goldbugs were really into that
gold / RMB / oil contract angle.

Is there a rule that says if you are anti-dollar, anti-US, and have
recession-passion, then u have to be a goldcuck, pro China?

Toffler used to look at level of cynicism in soc to gauge some stuff. It's not a bad measure... With many politicians I give'em a lota leeway. Cynicism level: medium. I guess.

Buttgeek sounds like squarely for M4A. He doesnt want to be pinned
down in certain yes/no questions, but the oscillation is around single
payer 4 sure.

Not everyone is Bernie. Giving a negative headline by one wrong
sentence would scare most politicians. U r but one guy, and there is
this entire machinery dissecting your every move.

With Steophnaopoplouuopuuoupoouuouous the headline he was fishing for
is "I Will Replace Private Companies", in a way that sounds like "I Am
A Gay Commie Who Will Also Take Your Child".

So you dont give that to him. You oscillate while indicating you are
for what u r for.

No food, and now no electricity. Yeah I bet that's US's fault too.. In a country where oil is cheaper than water.
