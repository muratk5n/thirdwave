<h1>Week 5</h1>
<p>Marche, <em>The Next Civil War</em>: "You know the problem of inequality is
serious when rich people have started to worry that they’re too
rich. In the United States, the wealthiest of the ultrawealthy, the
kind who wouldn’t notice $10 million one way or another, are forming
political action committees opposed to the concentration of wealth in
their own hands. The Patriotic Millionaires formed in 2010 with two
extraordinary goals: to lobby politicians to increase their taxes, and
to explain to ordinary Americans how unjust the economic order is. Two
of the richest men in the world, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, have
publicly called on the government to raise their tax rates. 'I have a
message for my fellow filthy rich, for all of us who live in our gated
bubble worlds,' warned early Amazon investor Nick Hanauer in
2014. 'Wake up, people. It won’t last.' He couldn’t be more right. The
Koch brothers have recently shifted their charitable endeavors from
libertarian politics to the problem that the new generation will be
worse off than the old.</p>
<p>The rich know what historians know: every society in human history
with levels of inequality like those in the United States today has
descended into war, revolution, or plague. No exceptions. There are
precisely zero historical precedents that don’t end in
destruction. Since 1980, inequality has been growing globally, but in
the United States the growth is most dramatic. In 2015, the top 1
percent of American families made 26.3 times what the 99 percent did,
garnering 22 percent of all income—the highest share since the peak of
23.9 percent before the Great Depression. In 1965, a CEO made roughly
twenty times the typical worker’s pay.  Now it’s 271 times. From 1980
on, the poorest 50 percent of the population has consistently seen a
decline in their share of income. American inequality is now worse
than it was in 1774"</p>

<p>In light of US tech oligarchy setting its sights on Wikimedia
Foundation, a historical detail I did not know before: #Wikipedia
became the non-profit it is today partly as the result of a labour
strike of Spanish Wikipedia editors who disagreed with the proposed
inclusion of advertisements. Initially, it was not clear what revenue
model Wikipedia would get, and Wales moved towards a for-profit model
already a year after launch. However, rather than working for free, so
Jimmy Wales could profit from their labour via advertising, Spanish
contributors forked Spanish Wikipedia as the Encyclopedia Libre
Universal. Under the threat of losing the editorial community of such
a large language, Wales conceded and set up the non-profit"</p>

<p>The article on Sun's density required prev knowledge of Sun-Earth

<p>Note "the reduction in the velocity of light" statement - with the
scheme below the speed of light is variable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Puthoff: "Textbook presentations treat General Relativity (GR) in
terms of tensor formulations in curved space-time.. One [different]
approach that has a long history in GR studies.. is what can be called
the polarizable-vacuum (PV) representation of GR. Introduced by Wilson
and developed further by Dicke, the PV approach treats metric changes
in terms of equivalent changes in the permittivity and permeability
constants of the vacuum, $\epsilon_o$ and $\mu_o$..</p>
<p>In brief, Maxwell's equations in curved space are treated in the
isomorphism of a polarizable medium of variable refractive index in
flat space; the bending of a light ray near a massive body is modeled
as due to an induced spatial variation in the refractive index of the
vacuum near the body; the GR reduction in the velocity of light in a
gravitational potential as compared to a flat-space reference frame at
infinity is represented by an effective increase in the refractive
index of the vacuum, and so forth"</p>

<hr />
<p>Puthoff: "Gravitational theory.. is recognized to be essentially
phenomenological in nature. As such, it invites attempts at derivation
from a more fundamental set of underlying assumptions, and six such
attempts are outlined in the standard reference book <em>Gravitation</em>, by
Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler. Of the six approaches presented..
perhaps the most far-reaching in its implications for an underlying
model is one due to Sakharov; namely, that gravitation is not a
fundamental interaction at all, but rather an induced effect brought
about by changes in the quantum-fluctuation energy of the vacuum when
matter is present. In this view the attractive gravitational force is
more akin to the induced van der Waals and Casimir forces.. In this
paper we explore the Saharov viewpoint on the basis of a conceptually
simple, classical model"</p>

<hr />
<p>Louis de Brogli was JPV's mentor we mentioned earlier. Big shot. </p>
<hr />
<p>Jean-Pierre Vigier: "The evidence from.. six experiments that bear on
the question of the speed of gravity is unambiguous in excluding
answers as slow as lightspeed...  no serious claim of experimental
support for gravity propagating at lightspeed has been advanced in
modern times. Attempts to do so have seriously confused changes in
gravitational force fields with gravitational radiation (an effect of
changes in potential fields), the latter of which unquestionably would
propagate at speed c..</p>
<p>When a source mass accelerates, that induces changes in its
gravitational force field. The lack of detectable aberration
(propagation delay) for those changes means that the distant
gravitational field accelerates when the source mass accelerates, in
lockstep. To avoid direct violation of the causality principle, the
propagation delay must be finite, even though much smaller than the
corresponding propagation delay for photons. Because special
relativity (SR) forbids propagation speeds faster than lightspeed in
forward time, the customary interpretation of that theory is in
conflict with, and is potentially falsified by, this result. GR has
always implicitly recognized these facts through its equations of
motion, which use instantaneous coordinates and momenta rather than
retarded ones. That and its reliance on a single frame to define
‘‘coordinate time’’ mean that GR is based as much on Lorentz’s
interpretation of relativity (LR) as on SR. These two theories, LR and
SR, both employ the relativity principle and the same math (Lorentz
transformations), but LR adopts a preferred frame and lacks the
reciprocity between frames postulated by SR. Interestingly, no
experiment testing SR or LR confirms frame reciprocity. Therefore,
because LR is consistent with all experiments, it remains just as
viable as SR as a model for the relativity of motion. It follows that
the falsification of the SR interpretation in favor of the LR
interpretation has no immediate mathematical consequences for GR. The
main physical consequence is negation of the proof that
faster-than-light propagation is impossible"</p>

<p>As Chomsky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/opinion/noam-chomsky-chatgpt-ai.html">said</a>
these things are "lumbering statistical engine[s]" for pattern
matching which "gorg[e] on hundreds of terabytes of data and
extrapolating the most likely conversational response or most probable
answer to a scientific question". They are not efficient. So it should
be no surprise some found ways of optimizing it. But the optimization
is like optimizing an hammer that constantly, wrogly seeks nails to
hit, in other words a better wrong tool for a misanalyzed problem.</p>

<p>Lithium-ion batteries likely contributed to the spread of LA
wildfires..  if they burn longer and almost impossible to put out,
they would contribute to the spread more than any other material.</p>
<hr />
<p>VICE: "Burning EV Batteries Are Delaying LA Wildfire Clean-Up...
lithium-ion batteries.. have complicated the fight against LA
wildfires. When those batteries catch fire, they become a raging
inferno nearly impossible to put out. A Tesla-related car accident
back in 2018 is a tragic example of this. The car crashed, bursting
into flames and killing everyone inside. It took emergency responders
almost 300 gallons of water and foam to extinguish the fire. After
everyone thought the blaze was subdued, responders were loading the
Tesla for removal when the battery ignited again, entirely on its
own. The fires are so intense and difficult to combat that a common
tactic for battling them is to not battle them at all — just let them
burn until there’s nothing left.</p>
<hr />
<p>Bloomberg: "Burning Teslas in LA Add to Toxic Mix Hindering Wildfire
Cleanup.. As the smoke clears from devastating Los Angeles wildfires,
efforts to clean up the affected areas are being complicated by
burnt-out electric and hybrid vehicles and home-battery storage
systems.</p>
<p>Lithium batteries from Tesla Inc., along with those from other
carmakers, have added to the mix of toxic materials requiring
specialized removal in the wake of the fires, delaying the fire
victims’ return to their properties.</p>
<p>'A lot of the cars in the evacuation area were lithium batteries,'
said Jacqui Irwin, a state assembly member representing the Pacific
Palisades, one of the neighborhoods hardest hit by the fires. 'We’ve
heard from firefighters that those lithium batteries burned fires near
homes – like those with power walls – for much longer.'.. Fires in
lithium batteries can require large amounts of water to put out"</p>

<p>Section 31 was not part of Roddenberry canon, it was added later,
during the Deep Space Nine era where the storylines also displayed
frequent usage of munee, capitalist Ferrengi were normalized, and

its record was beaten by ST Discovery.</p>

<p>There is no deep state in US today</p>

<p>#FreeLuigi</p>
<hr />
<p>The movie is about "Section 31" the deep state of the
Federation. Today's corporate power via their movies would rather have
you think about a futuristic deep state which evokes images of
bureucratic opression, this way you fear government structures
<em>today</em>, with that fear tell the gov not to tax the rich (anything gov
does is bad), and the current privatized dystopia, a fascistic
corporate control mechanisms continue. Thankfully the movie sucks so
it will likely create the opposite effect.</p>
<hr />
<p>Critic: "The only thing Star Trek about this [movie] is some of the
names of the alien races, a few references here and there, and some
familiar sound effects. There's no boldly going anywhere here, there's
no interesting sci-fi concept, no highbrow ideas, no moral or ethical
dilemma, no intelligent plot, no exploration, no optimism, and no
hope. It's bland, bleak, dark, joyless, and dreadful"</p>

<p>Paper: "In this paper our aim is to show that an increase in wealth
inequality is associated with a slowdown in economic growth"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003801212400003X">[-]</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Sriskandarajah, LSE: "The rest is not just politics: how inequality is
trumping democracy.. In essence, the exponential accumulation of
wealth and power by the 'private few' reduces the capacity of the
'public many' to exercise the freedom to make the choices that shape
our lives. The promise that each of us in a democracy has an equal
vote and equal say in how our society functions then begins to ring
hollow.</p>
<p>Those earning less than a minimum wage are the least likely to be
civically engaged... inequality lowers an individual’s sense of trust
in others: not in family or friends but in unspecified persons. Again,
this kind of generalised trust is a core component of social
capital. We tend to have less trust in people who are dissimilar to
us, which might explain the striking correlation observed in countries
like the US between an increase in income inequality and a sharp
decline in trust.</p>
<p>Central to neoliberalism is the push to shrink the size of the state –
to see little or no need for social security provisions or any other
transfers of resources from richer to poorer groups of
society. Neoliberals are steadfastly against such
'redistribution'. But a study by the non-partisan RAND Corporation
found an eye-watering level of redistribution in the US in the period
between 1975 and 2018 – just not in the direction that progressives
were calling for. During this era in which Reagonomics and neoliberal
policies were let loose, the bottom 90 per cent of America’s income
earners saw a hit to their combined incomes of $2.5 trillion each year
relative to the case where their incomes had grown in line with the
average(per capita) income trend for the country as a whole over this
period"</p>
