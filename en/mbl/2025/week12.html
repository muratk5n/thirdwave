<p><em>Careless People</em>: "The Italian prime minister tells us that he and

<p>Facebook deploy[ed] something called a 'double Irish' to avoid paying
taxes. It’s something Google and Apple do as well. The way the double
Irish works is that when one of these companies makes a dollar selling
ads (or iPhones in Apple’s case) in Italy or Germany or elsewhere in
the European Union, that revenue can be shifted to Ireland for tax
purposes, and then on to a tax-haven country like Bermuda that charges
no taxes at all. To do this, the companies have to set up subsidiaries
in Ireland and transfer their foreign IP rights to those
subsidiaries. What Ireland gets out of the deal is big Google and
Apple and Facebook operations located on their soil, with thousands of
local employees earning good wages. Those employees pay taxes to
Ireland, even if the tech companies don’t. After years of controversy
and opposition, the EU had just forced Ireland to shut down the
boondoggle"</p>

<hr />
<p>Watched <em>CA Brave New World</em>. There was a good movie somewhere in
there struggling to get out.. The action was above average, the script
could definitely be better. Some stuff did not jel internally, or the
stakes failed short. CA-Falcon rel was fine, same for potus character,
but why tie the story so closely to the failed 2008 Hulk movie? The
problem was likely working backward from the "Red" Hulk, he had to be
a president, had to be Hulk, they lost flexibility and depth there,
tried to recover by canonizing an earlier movie hoping to get some
mojo but things went sideways from there. Sterns was a bad choice as
the level boss.</p>
<hr />
<p>It was critical that the MIC, or the MILC to use Israel as its window
dressing / moneymaker... ISR is in a region awash with oil money,
chaos can be generated through/for it, which mean increased sales. By
hiding behind Israel the MIC can justify almost any spending, both to
them and to other countries around them.</p>
<p>If ISR gets any pushback the comeback is easy, reference the ultimate
victimhood, past experience of Jewry with genocide. This is where the
"right to defend itself" mantra comes from, it is supposed to evoke
images of Jews in gas chambers, remind us the ultimate wronged people,
so we need to make sure it does not happen again, we sell them
arms. Then the region goes to shit, sell neighbors around them
arms. Rinse, repeat.</p>

<p>NYT: "In Call With Trump, Putin Concedes Little on Ukraine"</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Careless People</em>: "Just a few weeks after [Joel Kaplan] takes over
[the Facebook global public policy, 2011] job, Joel starts hiring a
political sales team to push politicians—here and abroad—into becoming
advertisers. The idea is, if politicians depend on Facebook to win
elections, they’ll be less likely to do anything that’ll harm
Facebook. If Facebook is the goose that lays the golden egg, no one
wants to kill the goose. Get them hooked on those golden eggs.</p>
<p>Political advertising is a way to change that. And elections are the
biggest opportunity. Fresh-faced Harvard grads start moving into the
Washington, DC, office to sell ads to politicians and political
campaigns.</p>
<p>I find this all repugnant. I feel alienated from this new regime from
the outset. As a foreigner, I have a very different perspective on
money in elections. New Zealand, like so many other countries, has
strict limits on electoral spending: under 27,500 New Zealand dollars
per candidate. I’m astounded at the role money plays in elections in
the US. It determines so much about whose voice gets heard on every
issue... I’m also against exporting this value system. But Facebook is
effectively bringing this in globally by stealth"</p>

<p>Wynn-Williams, <em>Careless People</em>: "Facebook had planned to launch a
Facebook for children codenamed 'Project Family,' and Sheryl
[Sandberg] would occasionally remind the policy team of their 'failure
to do this while we had the opportunity,' blaming the policy team for
missing the chance to get kids on Facebook but she, like most of the
leaders at Facebook with younger children, severely limits her kids’
access to screens, let alone social media accounts. And she never
shares images of her children on social media. Silicon Valley is awash
in wooden Montessori toys and shrouded in total screen bans. Parents
at work talk about how they don’t allow their teens to have mobile
phones, which only underscores how well these executives understand
the real damage their product inflicts on young minds.</p>

<p>Davis: "A short and by no means exhaustive list of [mil misspending]
might include the RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter
(launched in 1991, canceled after $6.9 billion), the XM2001 Crusader
mobile cannon (launched in 1995, canceled after 7 billion), and the
Future Combat Systems (launched in 2003, canceled after 20
billion). FCS in particular was notable for senior Army leaders’
efforts to ignore or suppress the results of simulations, tests and
analyses that highlighted problems and ultimately predicted failure...</p>
<p>After each of these failures, one might expect the Army and program
leaders to have suffered censure. Instead, the opposite seems
generally to have been the case. The leaders of failed programs and
other efforts received prestigious medals, promotion to higher ranks,
and plum follow-on jobs; others retired and went to work for defense
contractors, often with companies that had profited from the failed
acquisition effort"</p>
<hr />
<p>The smear campaign against Col Daniel Davis originates from MIC. The
"Jew stuff" is an excuse, it gives trolls something to latch on
to. Just like the attacks on Corbyn had nothing to do with
anti-semitism, this one did not either. The Zionist lobby is a mere
appendage to the military-industrial complex. The tail does not wag
the dog.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Careless People</em>: [Story from 2011] Most countries like Facebook.
Germany’s an outlier. The Germans disapprove of everything Facebook
stands for. It wasn’t very long ago that Germans lived with networks
of spies and informants in their country—the Stasi in East Germany and
the Gestapo before that. As a result, they have a fundamental
suspicion of anyone who wants to gather lots of personal
information—which of course is Facebook’s business model. Where others
see a website that’s good for wasting time, Germans see a
comprehensive surveillance tool that needs muscular oversight"</p>

<p>Under U.S. law, organizing a general strike—especially across
industries—is straight-up illegal. The Taft-Hartley Act (1947) makes
it a felony to advocate for a mass strike across sectors. Courts ruled
long ago that calls for general strikes count as criminal
conspiracy—which is why labor leaders, radicals, and workers have been
crushed every time they tried to organize one.</p>
<p>Think about that: The state doesn’t just want you working, it wants
you to believe striking is an option—so they can catch you the second
you push too far. They let the words circulate, they let people dream
about it, but they’ve ensured that the mechanisms for a general strike
are dead on arrival"</p>
