<p>It is sad to see admin rolling over and showing its belly though at

<p>Davis: "A short and by no means exhaustive list of [mil misspending]
might include the RAH-66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter
(launched in 1991, canceled after $6.9 billion), the XM2001 Crusader
mobile cannon (launched in 1995, canceled after 7 billion), and the
Future Combat Systems (launched in 2003, canceled after 20
billion). FCS in particular was notable for senior Army leaders’
efforts to ignore or suppress the results of simulations, tests and
analyses that highlighted problems and ultimately predicted failure...</p>
<p>After each of these failures, one might expect the Army and program
leaders to have suffered censure. Instead, the opposite seems
generally to have been the case. The leaders of failed programs and
other efforts received prestigious medals, promotion to higher ranks,
and plum follow-on jobs; others retired and went to work for defense
contractors, often with companies that had profited from the failed
acquisition effort"</p>

<p>The smear campaign against Col Daniel Davis originates from MIC. The
"Jew stuff" is an excuse, it gives trolls something to latch on
to. Just like the attacks on Corbyn had nothing to do with
anti-semitism, this one did not either. The Zionist lobby is a mere
appendage to the military-industrial complex. The tail does not wag
the dog.</p>

<p><em>Careless People</em>: [Story from 2011] Most countries like Facebook.
Germany’s an outlier. The Germans disapprove of everything Facebook
stands for. It wasn’t very long ago that Germans lived with networks
of spies and informants in their country—the Stasi in East Germany and
the Gestapo before that. As a result, they have a fundamental
suspicion of anyone who wants to gather lots of personal
information—which of course is Facebook’s business model. Where others
see a website that’s good for wasting time, Germans see a
comprehensive surveillance tool that needs muscular oversight"</p>

peninsula, a small and seemingly insignificant stretch of land

player in global shipping.</p>

<p>"@emsenn@kolektiva.social</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, organizing a general strike—especially across
industries—is straight-up illegal. The Taft-Hartley Act (1947) makes
it a felony to advocate for a mass strike across sectors. Courts ruled
long ago that calls for general strikes count as criminal
conspiracy—which is why labor leaders, radicals, and workers have been
crushed every time they tried to organize one.</p>
<p>Think about that: The state doesn’t just want you working, it wants
you to believe striking is an option—so they can catch you the second
you push too far. They let the words circulate, they let people dream
about it, but they’ve ensured that the mechanisms for a general strike
are dead on arrival"</p>
