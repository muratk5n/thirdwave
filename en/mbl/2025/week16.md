convenience. Rights are granted to those who align with power. For the
poor, for people of color, for those who resist injustice, rights are

In 2001 someone tried to blow up a jet with a shoe bomb, then regular
citizens are forced to take off their shoes at the airport since - the
bought out government wants to protect the plane, not help people on
it. In 2017 someone murders 60 people in Las Vegas, there is a brief
ban o bump-stock firearms, the ban quickly goes away. Why? The biz
friendly government is protecting the firearms industry not the people
getting shot by that industry's product. Without the proper lens, the
policies described sound contradictory. They are not.

---

You can't understand America from the lens of public policy, as in the
helper / protector of citizens, in a "continental", "Napoleanic Code"
kind of way. Their ruling class origin is plutocracy.

---

They like freedoms that help businesses and the wealthy.. This is a
selective type of freedom.

I bet the same people who are against government interventions support

freedom.. which one is it?

Doctorow: "Mark Zuckerberg personally lost the Facebook antitrust
case.. It's damned hard to prove an antitrust case: so often, the
prosecution has to prove that the company *intended* to crush
competition, and/or that they raised prices or reduced quality because
they knew they didn't have to fear competitors...

Now imagine that [a] founder/CEO.. who communicated with his
underlings almost exclusively in writing, and thus did he commit to
immortal digital storage a stream – a torrent – of memos in which he
explicitly confessed his guilt...

Zuck's CFO.. wrote to Zuck warning him that it was illegal to buy
Insta in order to 'neutralize a potential competitor.'.. Zuck replied
that he was, indeed, solely contemplating buying Insta in order to
neutralize a potential competitor"

not only a security threat, but also cripples the growth of the
country's own digital economy, the CDU politician told "Bild." The
move has already been decided in the state"

Stevenson: "[Let's take someone with a] wealth of 700 million
pound[s].. People often don't realize there is a passive income that
comes with that... When I say passive income, I mean that the income
he gets just from his wealth not from his work. You know he's going to
make around 5%, £35 million a year, let's be conservative, 26 million
a year, half a million pound a week. So imagine.. you're making half a
million pounds passive income a week, how much you're going to spend?
Not a lot. You'd spend, you know, 50 grand a week, live like the queen
basically, I couldn't spend 50 grand a week if I tried, right? The
problem is, once you have this group of society with very large
passive income, unless you have a rapidly growing economy, they
basically have nothing they can do with that income other than buy up
the rest of the assets. It's as simple as that. It's basically
compound interest, if you have the wealth of the rich growing at 5% in
an economy that is growing at one or two percent, there's nothing they
can do, they outgrow the economy, and they squeeze everyone else
out. And what ordinary people see is house price is going up, stock
price is going up, my kids can't afford the house.. and that is is the
rich squeezing the middle class out.  It's the kids of the rich
outbidding your kids for things like houses, [college degrees, even
medical services]"

NPR: "[2013] There's a saying in Mexico: *Sin maiz, no hay pais*: no
corn, no country. Mexico is where corn originated, and it's the food
staple most people depend on. It's what Antonio Pena grew on his
family farm in Guanajuato in Central Mexico...

The Mexican government used to subsidize corn. It kept the crop price
high so small farmers could stay in business. And it kept tortilla
prices low so poor people could eat. When NAFTA took effect two
decades ago, the trade agreement phased out tariffs in order to lower
costs and encourage investment between the U.S., Canada and
Mexico. The Mexican government ended its corn subsidy..

Seventy-five thousand Iowa farmers grew twice as much corn as three
million Mexican farmers at half the cost. U.S. corn flooded Mexico. An
estimated two million Mexican farm workers in general left the
countryside for big cities. Antonio Pena was one of them... Then, like
millions more Mexicans, he crossed illegally into the U.S."

Reuters: "One of U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's leading
advisers, Dan Caldwell, was escorted from the Pentagon on Tuesday
after being identified during an investigation into leaks at the
Department of Defense, a U.S. official told Reuters.

Caldwell had drawn attention in Washington for past views that critics
have called isolationist, but which advocates said sought to
right-size America's defense priorities.

A Marine Corps veteran who deployed to Iraq, Caldwell was quoted
saying before going to the Pentagon that America would have been
better off if U.S. troops had just stayed home... 'I think the Iraq
war was a monstrous crime,' Caldwell told the Financial Times in
December 2024."

"@jon@vivaldi.net

.. [Y]ears ago Norwegians started to get pre-filled tax returns in the
mail. Later they stopped getting them, but instead had to do [it]
online. Now even that is not needed... The reality is that the
government already had most of the data needed for most
individuals. Your salary is reported by the company you work for. Your
bank details, including anything you have in your accounts, any loans,
stocks, bonds, etc., is reported as well. Your kids are known.. There
might be details to add, but most is known. Why waste people´s time
filling out details that are already known and risk people making
mistakes?"

---

"Simplifying the tax code"... Another mantra that never seems to
materialize... I bet bihness interests *want* the tax code Byzantine,
the law is full of loopholes, kickbacks, indirect handouts that
way.. And at the end you can claim "government inefficiency" and
create a cottage industry around it... Bihness wins twice.

US is a corporatocracy. They are in charge, other power centers are
their puppet. Israel could never have pulled off this mayhem they've
created if it wasn't for MIC's permission. Helpless civilians are

Critic says new movies look dull, like sludge, flat. In older movies
colors looked bold, shadows are rich, some exterior shots even look
like oil paintings. The contrasts are great. His expl is new digital
cameras kept improving high dynamic range, but the tech shows too
much. Have to adjust the new tech differently to create a good viewing
experience, most directors don't try.

Paper: "The global plastic waste crisis requires innovative solutions,
and pyrolysis has emerged as a promising technology. This review
critically examines pyrolysis technologies for plastic waste
management, focusing on their efficiency, economic potential, and
environmental impact. Pyrolysis can convert 60 %–80 % of plastic waste
into liquid fuels..  Pyrolysis generates a range of gases, including
hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4), propylene (C3H6), and
other hydrocarbons... Hydrogen gas, a key pyrolysis product, has
applications in fuel cells and as a clean energy carrier"

Politico: "[A] Democratic lawmaker is seeking a simple but jarring
remedy of last resort for California’s college students navigating the
state’s housing crisis: Let them sleep in their cars... While roughly
half a dozen state legislative proposals this year seek to fund
student or faculty housing or loosen building regulations, the
benefits would come far too late for current students struggling to
stay afloat. With one in four California community college students
experiencing homelessness in the past year, Democrats — who have a
supermajority in the statehouse — face increasing pressure to deliver
on affordability issues.

Sometimes a certain element isn't actually "rare", the slave labor to
mine it, and countries who are willing to pollute the environment to
produce it are "rare". In that case, automation, clean ways to mine
and process can help.

We fast need to develop synthetic subsitutes for every rare element

Imagine a room full of people playing such an evolutionary game, one
strategy is Slap-for-Slap, if person get slapped on the face in one
round, he will slap back in the next round. In perfect information
scenario no one would slap anyone. But introduce a little noise
(misunderstanding, wrongful attack) slapping back and forth would
start, and after a while everyone in that room would be slapping the
shit out of each other. Some forgiveness would alleviate that.

Ball, *Critical Mass*: "One of the most interesting and important
questions we can ask of the Prisoner’s Dilemma is what kind of
behavior emerges when the players can evolve—when they are allowed to
change their strategies.. This can be simulated in Axelrod-style
tournaments by including an evolutionary dimension. At the end of one
full round-robin, for example, we might allow players to adopt a new
strategy, where the probability of each strategy’s being chosen is
proportional to that strategy’s overall score. In this way, the more
successful strategies will multiply while ones that perform poorly
will die out. It’s not hard to see that this is a Darwinian 'survival
of the fittest' scenario. It mimics the way in which genetic mutations
spread in a population..

[Nowak, Sigmund] .. conducted just such an experiment in game theory
in 1992, with salutary results. They set up a diverse population of
strategies, in all of which the choice of whether to cooperate or
defect was determined by what the opponent did in the previous
round. Some strategies were more inclined toward defection, others
tended to cooperation. Nowak and Sigmund let them all compete against
one another, and then altered the proportions of each of them in line
with their relative successes.

Naïvely, we might expect that this evolutionary mode) will be ruled by
Tit for Tat, which appears generally to fare best in a mixed
population. And this did at first seem to be the outcome...  But [it
was] found that the triumph of TFT is short-lived.  Once it has
established a culture of cooperation, TFT starts to suffer from its
Achilles’ heel: unforgivingness. These simulations contained an
inherent amount of noise in the way the strategies worked, and this
meant that TFT was gradually superseded by its more tolerant sibling,
Generous Tit for Tat.  In the end, only GTFT remained"

---

Jesus was onto something when he talked abt forgiveness as opposed to
immediate reprisal which in Game Theory called Tit-for-Tat.  Such
approaches can be tested in an evolutionary simulations, in multiple
rounds where multiple players are tested and each player is allowed to
change strategy (choose among some possibilities, TFT being
one). Forgiveness can be an evolutionary advantage. Excerpt above.
