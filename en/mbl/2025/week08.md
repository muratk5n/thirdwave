"Under the French anti-waste law for a circular economy (AGEC), which
came into force in 2020 after years of development, some 70 percent of
most non-hazardous building waste had to be collected for processing
in France. The objective is gradually rising, too: In 2024, the target
was 82 percent, and it will increase to 93 percent by 2027."

Masse, *Nature of Physical Fields and Forces*: "A Higgs particle can
never be directly detected. It is thought to exist for only about 10 âˆ’
22 seconds. The existence of Higgs particles can only be inferred from
indirect evidence. This inferential process involves examining the
decay products of high energy particle collisions that occur within a
particle accelerator in a search for a certain decay pattern that has
been predicted for Higgs particles. Because of the massive amount of
data produced in these high energy collisions, extensive data
filtering is performed before any search for decay patterns even
begins. Statistical methods are then used to detect Higgs particles
based on a theoretical model known as the Standard Model of particle
physics. If more decay patterns are found having the expected Higgs
decay pattern than predicted by the Standard Model assuming Higgs
particles do not exist, then the existence of Higgs particles is
inferred.

In 2013 the existence of Higgs particles was inferred based upon such
indirect evidence. Clearly the validity of this inference depends not
only on the functioning of the extreme amount of computer filtering
necessary to obtain a meaningful signal from the immense
collision-created noise background, but also on the validity of the
Standard Model.. The Standard Model has many problems, however, and is
almost certainly wrong.. Ironically, the inferred existence of the
Higgs particle is now being used to argue for the validity of the
Standard Model"

Masse's publishing indicates he researched, worked on geophysics,
earthquakes. The type of new physics he discusses requires hands-on,
solid knowledge of continuum mechanics, elasticity, wave progagation
which his branch would require to know from day one. I'd pay attention
to this guy.

Masse, *Physics: Where It Went Wrong*: Why does gravity exist? What
are light waves?.. Physics has provided no answers to these and many
other basic questions concerning our Universe.  You might even say
that physics has failed to discover the very nature of our
Universe. While the fundamental forces existing in our Universe have
indeed been detected, and the laws describing these forces have
generally been documented, the nature of these forces remains a total
mystery. Why has the science of physics not made more progress in
unveiling the workings of our Universe?

To find the answer to this question we must look back in time to the
early 1890s. It was then that a couple of perplexing problems first
arose in physics. The British physicist Lord Kelvin referred to these
problems as two 'nineteenth century clouds' over physics. When
physicists grappled with these problems, the conclusions they arrived
at set physics on a path that quickly descended into a labyrinth from
which physics has still not escaped.

Although physics can be employed successfully today on a practical
level, the foundations of physics now rest on quicksand. As the Nobel
prize winning physicist Richard Feynman observed, 'Itâ€™s a terrible
mix-up, and you might say itâ€™s a hopeless mess physics has got itself
worked into.'

The picture of reality that physics currently paints is so bizarre
and, frankly, so unbelievable, that beginning students in physics when
confronted with this picture can be excused from exclaiming 'You canâ€™t
be serious!' Unfortunately, the Alice-in-Wonderland worldview created
by modern physics has done little to achieve a better understanding of
the real Universe.  And, yes, there is a real Universe.

Deciphering secrets of the real Universe requires taking a new look at
some of the problems that plagued physicists over 100 years ago. As we
revisit these problems, we will find that it is possible to arrive at
conclusions quite different from those obtained many years
ago. Moreover, with our new insight into these problems, we can begin
to unravel some of the mysteries of our Universe that have puzzled
mankind for centuries"

SecDef Mattis was vehemently against that pullout, but he was
appointed by DJT.  Remember Mattis, he was confirmed 98-1 in the
Senate (compared to recent chief who nearly lost his
confirmation). And Mattis was nominated because Trump did not want to
ruffle feathers in his first term, he chose a guy within certain
parameters, then that guy responded in ways that were
predictable. There is no deep state. Trump got the outcome he prepared
the conditions for.

Seeking Alpha: "Tesla: Celebrating 40 Months Of Nothing.. Tesla,
Inc. stock has gone nowhereâ€¦ make that, worse than nowhere, since late
2021, despite tons of volatility. I recently polled an audience I was
speaking to.. and the answer didn't shock me. Because I'm no spring
chicken. The question was this:

Rank these in order of total return since November 1, 2021 (now nearly
40 months ago, more than 3 years ago.

- Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA)
- S&P 500 Equal Weight (i.e., the average stock) (RSP)
- 1-3 month US T-bills (BIL)
- Tesla stock.

Every single respondent had TSLA as the best performer since the start
of November 2021. Here are the facts. TSLA has earned less than
nothing in nearly 40 months. It was recently down 10% over that
time. The Dow has not exactly been the S&P 500 (SP500) or Nasdaq 100
(NDX), but it has certainly done what investors hope a stock portfolio
would do over that time. The average stock gained 20%, or about 1/2%
per month on average. And the T-bill ETF outperformed TSLA by more
than 22% during those 40 months"

PJ Onori: "Itâ€™s 2025. Read.cv is shutting down. WordPress is on
fire. Twitter has completely melted down. Companies are changing their
content policies en masse. Social networks are becoming increasingly
icy towards anything outside of their walled garden. Services are
using the content you post to feed proprietary LLMs. Government
websites appear to be purging data. Itâ€™s a wild time.

Itâ€™s hard to know where this bottoms out. And those who rely on these
services are just along for the ride. Web 2.0 seemed like such a great
idea in a more innocent time. Weâ€™re at a point where itâ€™s only prudent
to view third-parties as guilty until proven innocent. Not as some
abstract, principled stance, but for our own direct benefit.

Now, more than ever, itâ€™s critical to own your data. Really own
it. Like, on your hard drive and hosted on your website. Ideally on
your own server, but one step at a time"

Oliver Stone, *The Untold History of US*: "The feeble international

forces set out to topple the elected Spanish government and establish
a fascist regime. The republic had made enemies among U.S. officials
and corporate leaders by its progressive policies and tight regulation
of business...

The United States, following the British and French lead, banned the
shipment of weapons to both sides, which weakened the beleaguered and
outgunned government forces. Ford, GM, Firestone, and other
U.S. businesses provided the fascists with trucks, tires, and machine
tools. Texaco Oil Company, headed by pro-Fascist Colonel Thorkild
Rieber, promised Franco all the oil he neededâ€”on credit. Roosevelt,
furious, threatened an oil embargo and slapped Texaco with a fine. But
Rieber persisted undeterred, supplying oil to Hitler and being
lionized in the pages of Life magazine"

You obtain the college degree, and it is yours. It is non-perishable.
It looks like an asset. We notice another similarity to real estate,
tuition prices keeps increasing and the middle class increasingly has
to rely on loans to even "stay in the market". In that sense the
student loan concept mirrors a mortgage loan concept.

---

Should a college degree be seen as an asset? It is offered in limited
amounts to a few each year so maybe yes. Then this explains why
college tuition skyrocketed, just like real estate, degree-as-asset is
becoming more expensive bcz the rich gets richer pouring more money
into this asset class.

simple coding to connect the route IDs that reference stops, listing
them as needed. Use case: stops data has geo coords, a DIY external
service gets data from muni, could find the closest stop to current
location, and calculates all routes going through that stop, displays
them.
