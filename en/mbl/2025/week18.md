Nature: "Here we present a method using fossil-free hydrogen-plasma-based
reduction to extract nickel from low-grade ore variants known as
laterites. We bypass the traditional multistep process and combine
calcination, smelting, reduction and refining into a single
metallurgical step conducted in one furnace. This approach produces
high-grade ferronickel alloys at fast reduction
kinetics. Thermodynamic control of the atmosphere of the furnace
enables selective nickel reduction, yielding an alloy with minimal
impurities.. eliminating the need for further refining. The proposed
method has the potential to be up to about 18% more energy efficient
while cutting direct carbon dioxide emissions by up to 84% compared
with current practice"

LLM do terribly at queries requiring structure bcz IMO they lack
internal structure themselves. Except those spaghetti neuron
connections there isn't much of anything in there, they are supposed
to be "universal learners" you see, be able to learn
anything. Learning in the sense of machine learning. Sure they learn
everything but understand nothing. Intelligence needs to be coded in,
starting from low to higher and higher abtractions, finally ending up
with intelligence.  We can't shove gobs of data on one end and expect
the thing will discover, spit out fully formed structures on the other
end.

---

LLMs need to be subjected to rigorous summary / concept based
tests.. Anyone who wants to tie something mission critical to them
at this stage need to get their head examined.

clear attacker in this case, no country had attacked another, an
intelligent actor would've pointed that out.

\#Gemini \#LLM Stupid, stupid.. I asked it a GDELT type question,
"read article and summarize who attacked who, and where". [Link](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2025/04/30/pakistan-shoots-down-two-indian-quadcopter-near-loc/).

First it extracted a chunk of text, w/ attacker/attacked wording all a
mess. I asked to boil down to specific countries, locales - it gave a
list, without direction, A on B, or B on A. The place was wrong, gave
the place of an *earlier* attack the article shared as a side note,
not the main location.

Doctorow: "In the summer of 2023, [Tesla] was caught lying to drivers
about its carsâ€™ range: Drivers noticed that they were getting far
fewer miles out of their batteries than Tesla had
advertised. Naturally, they contacted the company for service on their
faulty cars. Tesla then set up an entire fake service operation in
Nevada that these calls would be diverted to, called the 'diversion
team.' Drivers with range complaints were put through to the
'diverters' who would claim to run 'remote diagnostics' on their cars
and then assure them the cars were fine. They even installed a special
xylophone in the diversion team office that diverters would ring every
time they successfully deceived a driver.

These customers were then put in an invisible Tesla service
jail. Their Tesla apps were silently altered so that they could no
longer book service for their cars for any reason â€” instead, theyâ€™d
have to leave a message and wait several days for a callback. The
diversion center racked up 2,000 calls/week and diverters were under
strict instructions to keep calls under five minutes. Eventually,
these diverters were told that they should stop actually performing
remote diagnostics on the cars of callers â€” instead, theyâ€™d just
pretend to have run the diagnostics and claim no problems were found"

Carriers are absolutely defenseless against hypersonic attack, esp. if
they arrive as a swarm.

---

Davis \#DeepDive says an earlier Houthi missile attack on an aircraft
carrier penetrated all outer defenses, it was shot down via Phalanx,
which is the last line of defense, a machine gun basically with about
a mile range. A carrier might not be as invincible as once thought. It
was the tool of power projection at one time when potential
adversaries did not have much. Now they do.

You would believe that only if you were literally born yesterday.  Who
is this guy kidding? Rates might have gone down but the duration went
up from 2-5 to 10-30 years, and now multigenerational mortgages are
considered, meaning the loan payer will not be able to repay within
the period OF THEIR LIFE. The underlying asset appreciated massively
due to influx of money from the uber-wealthy.

My wife is an auto damage adjuster, so she works with a lot of repair
shops.

Occasionally, she gets a shop with an IT issue that needs some help,
and I'll occasionally get brought in.

There are basically two kinds of car shops.

The first kind run on modern everything, and they are constantly
having problems with damn near all of it. They have gigE networks to
Windows 10/11 workstations, and 10gigE servers running some crazy ass
collection of parts lookup and work time quote estimating software
that is never fucking right, even when it isn't broken.

The second kind are running on a custom application from the early
1990s that runs on Foxpro that generates invoices, and forces you to
manually input part prices whenever they are an unknown, which is
almost always. They interact with other vendors and insurance via
exchange of paper documents. Their biggest issue is finding paper for
their dot matrix printers, and replacing failed CRTs and keyboards.

Guess which one has fewer operational issues?"

"Serverless computing" term can be confusing at first. Compared w/
hosting actual servers on someone else's cloud, have we now reached a
stage where there is no need for physical servers? Not exactly. The
progression of the tech went as follows.

1. Host your own servers (server side app, db) on your own
network.
1. Have a cloud provider host the same, on an always-on physical server
1. Cloud provider hosts non-persistent virtual servers, your instance
can started/killed as necessary.
1. Your server app can be written to a specific API, which cloud vendor
can scale up/down, bring online/offline as needed.
1. Today: You can submit little functions, pieces of code to a cloud,
and they are executed as needed, on the cloud infrastructure.

With the last development the concept of a "server app", virtual or
otherwise, becomes somewhat obsolete.

We need to mind the wording, *there is still hardware on the server
side* (the cloud) that runs your stuff. There is a physical server
somewhere. But the presence of an app, an app server written a certain
monolithic fashion by the developer is not assumed, the architecture
on the user side is more fluid. The granularity of code execution is
smaller.

"If you want to create completely free software for other people to
use, the absolute best delivery mechanism right now is static HTML and
JavaScript served from a free web host with an established

can be served in this way is vast and, I think, under appreciated"

New Scientist: "Earthquakes may generate huge volumes of hydrogen
within the planet by fracturing rocks that then react with water

"@jimbob@aus.social

I need to be very clear, that the push towards 'vibe coding' - that
is, deliberately deskilling people - is because AI code assistants are
an (increasingly expensive) subscription service.

If you know how to code, you can just write Python, C, Java, R, PHP,
whatever for free and make things. You may not own the tools of
production, but at least you're not renting them.

If you have been deskilled so you only know how to vibe code, you will
be paying for that privilege forever.

This also goes, by the way, for researchers who are starting to be
convinced they don't need to learn how to be scientists anymore,
because "the AI" can just do the science for them.  Nope"

The Conversation: "New survey shows the extent of class privilege in
UK journalism .. Our data does not suggest that a privileged
upbringing makes it more likely for journalists to hold a top
management position. Where it does make a difference, though, is
whether they work for national media or outlets with international
presence.. Of those who do only 9% come from a working-class
background, while 72% come from a privileged one"

Representative democracy works when it does (wout interference)
because the masses get asked a simple question which they can answer

Quora: "When a house is appraised, they look at the â€˜compsâ€™, or the
comparable housing in the area. The cost per square foot comes into
play in the calculations. If you have an area with 10 houses that are
all about 2,000 sq ft and they are all appraised at $200,000 with very
similar amenities and features, they are estimated to be about 100
dollars per sq ft. Then another house has slightly better amenities
and a newer roof and Hvac system, it might sell for 230,000, which
would make it 115 dollars per sq ft. When another house goes for
higher than 200,000, it tends to lift all the houses to the higher sq
ft price. Maybe the school district is highly rated and the area is
viewed as a safer area, the sq ft price will tend to rise. Now one of
those first 10 houses that were appraised at 200k are now appraised at
220 or 225."

---

The effect of concentrated wealth on housing is real. Wealthy person
buys a house in a neighborhood for obscene price just because s/he can,
that raises the price of other houses in the same neighborhood. The
effect can cascade, from top to bottom, in the end even the cheapest
house can become unaffordable even with a steady job and good income. 

---

Some wealth is based on stocks on a company held by its founder, how
can you tax that wout causing the founder lose control of the company?

If stock rises above a certain level, making the stock holder /
founder(s) multi-billionaire, government can take passive ownership of
a big chunk of those stocks, making sure founder does not become too
wealthy even if gains are not realized / made cash. Because if they
do, they become a threat to public's financial safety.

Founder can remain the majority owner, but would not be able to sell
all of the stocks, or even borrow against them - a large portion would
be under passive ownership by another entity.

The Suez Canal works on sea water.

Reshare from 2023

The Guardian: "[T]he Americans built the canal over the hills of
Panama in a series of great locks, a system that relies entirely on
rain... Around 52 million gallons of fresh water is lost to the sea
each time a ship enters or leaves the canal. That water is replaced
from a vast reservoir built high in the hills, which in turn is
replenished by heavy rainfall â€“ but if the rains dry up so does the
canal"
