<p>If the deal is signed why are they not boasting abt the details?</p>
<p>One claim is the deal contains major concessions from China which, if
made public, would make it clear Xi had nothing to do with the deal
that in turn would the make it obvious other power centers are in
charge in China, rather than Xi. Those centers asked US to delay
releasing the details and WH agreed. </p>

<p>The Verge: "Tesla’s robotaxi rollout has been rockier than the fanboys
and influencers who got early access to the company’s driverless
vehicles would like you to believe. And thanks to these diligent
Redditors, we now have a list of all the mistakes the company’s
“unsupervised” vehicles have made in the first couple days.</p>
<p>Some are relatively minor, like failing to recognize a reversing UPS
truck while trying to pull into a parking space or driving over a
curb. Others are more worrisome, like briefly driving on the wrong
side of the road or dropping passengers off in the middle of a busy
intersection.</p>
<p>Several incidents involve 'phantom braking,' in which the vehicle
stops suddenly for seemingly no reason. Tesla’s camera-only perception
system has long had problems with phantom braking, appearing to
misinterpret shadows, road marking, or other environmental factors,
which triggers the vehicle’s automatic emergency braking. The Reddit
list includes three incidents of phantom braking."</p>

<p>Sirota: "[A] rare &amp; candid admission that Pod Save truly is the
faction that doesnt care about the substance ('put his politics
aside') Inculcated by Obama, this faction cares only about aesthetics
&amp; doesn’t see how its substance-free version of Democratic politics is
precisely what voters have come to hate about Dems. They don’t
understand — or they don’t WANT to understand — that anti-oligarch
politics doesn’t have to be merely a brand/aesthetic, and that you
can’t just put those politics 'aside' from some allegedly separate
brand. In this era of oligarchy, the substance — not merely the
aesthetic — is what is galvanizing people."</p>

<p>CEM: "In the UK, you can be jailed for opposing genocide but not for
supporting it.. This is what happens when the people who commit
genocide are in charge..</p>
<p>The British government has been attacking our freedoms in recent
years, particularly since October 7, and those attacks have only
worsened since we got a Labour government. The most sinister strategy
has been to abuse counter-terrorism laws to silence anyone who calls
out Israel's genocide.</p>
<p>As you surely know, their latest effort in this regard is to proscribe
Palestine Action, classing it as a terrorist organisation. The
proscription could come into effect within a week, and would mean
anyone in the UK who expresses support for Palestine Action could face
up to 14 years in jail."</p>

<p>Sirota: "Thoughts &amp; prayers for the Pod Save Guys, the Abundance Guys
&amp; all the other Dems up late tonight crafting two different versions
of press releases/podcasts to go out tomorrow night - either claiming
Zohran's win as their own or claiming Cuomo's win as proof they've
been right to bash the left"</p>
<hr />
<p>The Lever: "Democratic Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral primary
victory in New York City has prompted an elite panic, the likes of
which we’ve rarely seen: Billionaires are desperately seeking a
general-election candidate to stop him, former Barack
Obama aides are publicly melting down, corporate moguls
are threatening a capital strike, and CNBC has become a television
forum for nervous breakdowns. Meanwhile, Democratic elites who’ve
spent a decade punching left are suddenly trying to align themselves
with and take credit for Mamdani’s brand (though not necessarily his
agenda).</p>
<p>On the surface, this freak-out can seem as if it’s about
policy. Mamdani’s proposals for free buses, universal free child care,
faster small-business licensing, higher taxes on the rich, some
publicly owned grocery stores, a higher minimum wage, and rent freezes
are indeed shocking to oligarchs conditioned to getting everything
they want. When you’re so accustomed to privilege, the most minimally
humane policies for others can seem like oppression — and Mamdani’s
agenda probably feels that way to New York’s billionaires, CEOs, and
neoliberals."</p>
<hr />
<p>Sirota: "Huge congratulations to the Pod Save Guys, the Abundance Guys
and all the Democratic pundits who suddenly discovered Mamdani and
started saying nice things about him less than 36 hours ago as soon as
the Polymarket odds shifted - this victory is all you guys, great work"</p>

<p>The street that my mum lives in is a one-way street, but wasn't marked
as such on #Google Maps. This caused many drivers to drive the wrong
way. I have tried to edit it on Google Maps (there is such
functionality), but to no avail. No matter how often I submitted a
change (with photos of street signs!), Google said "Sorry, we could
not verify it".</p>
<p>Solution: Edit the street on #OpenStreetMap! A few months after I did
this, Google seems to have stolen the data, as it regularly does, and
now the street is correct in both datasets!"</p>
