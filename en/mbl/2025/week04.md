# Week 4

CleanTechnica: "The Army’s interest in hydrogen vehicles surfaced on
the CleanTechnica radar back in 2010, when they were investigating
fuel cells to generate auxiliary power for tanks. Around that time the
Army also launched a small test fleet of GM fuel cell vehicles in
Hawaii.

Signs of a continued interest in fuel cell trucks emerged in 2017,
when the Army took note of the stealth advantages of a Chevy Colorado
electric vehicle powered by fuel cells. Last year the Army also
demonstrated a fuel cell rescue vehicle capable of going 1,500 miles
between refills, a key consideration for operation in remote
locations.

As for how to deliver hydrogen to vehicles in remote locations, the
Army has also been testing a mobile electrolysis unit, which can
scavenge local water and renewable energy resources to generate green
hydrogen on the spot (see lots more green hydrogen background here)...

In the latest development, the Army has emerged as a funder in support
of the California-based hydrogen compression firm Verne. The startup
launched in 2020, leveraging decades of research at Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory to increase the energy energy density of stored
hydrogen by deploying cryo-compressed hydrogen technology (CcH2 for
short)"

The deficit spending is for their benefit, it flows to their coffers,
to their companies. But now the government is in debt, no problem, the
rich buy that debt with the extra cash they received from the
government itself.. Good deal eh? The public is screwed twice, first
money does not increase their assets, second the rich end up with the
excess money which they use to increase their assets meaning a
decrease in living standards for the poor.

"When government deficit spends, how does the rich buy that debt
incurred from the deficit spending?"

Sun's mass is the dead giveaway. Simply rearranging grav pull force
for $M$ w/ given $m,G,F$ will make that clear. Plasma cannot provide
the density that the Sun has.

Universe is not isotropic. Dark Energy has been disproven. The sun is
not plasma (it consists of solid/liquid matter). Cosmic inflation is
debunked. Black holes are burning discs, even Hawking changed his mind
on their existence. There was no Big Bang. What else is left of modern
cosmology?

SciAm: "[2020] According to the key tenets of modern physics, the
cosmos is 'isotropic' at multi-billion-light-year scales—meaning it
should have the same look and behavior in every direction. Ever since
the big bang nearly 14 billion years ago, the universe ought to have
expanded identically everywhere...

Now, however, an x-ray survey of distances to galaxy clusters across
the heavens suggests some are significantly closer or farther away
than isotropy would predict. This finding could be a sign that the
universe is actually 'anisotropic'..

An anisotropic universe would shake the pillars of physics, demanding
major revisions to current thinking about cosmic evolution. 'If [the
universe’s growth] is indeed different in different directions, that
brings a whole new wrinkle into a cosmological assumption about
homogeneity of the expansion over sufficiently large regions of
space,' says Megan Donahue, a Michigan State University astrophysicist
who was not involved in the study. A lopsided expansion 'would be
astonishing and depressing,' she adds, because it would suggest our
understanding of the universe’s large-scale structure and evolution is
profoundly—perhaps permanently—incomplete"

OS News: "They tried to keep it from prying eyes, but several people
did notice it: Google made a pretty significant policy change
regarding the use of fingerprinting by advertisers. While Google did
not allow advertisers to use digital fingerprinting, the company has
now changed its mind on this one.

>Previously, Google did not allow advertisers to pass any information
>to it that
>
>- Google could use or recognize as personally-identifiable information.
>- Permanently identifies a particular device (such as a mobile phone’s
>unique device identifier if such an identifier cannot be reset).
>
>The second rule has been removed in the new policy. In other words,
>advertisers may identify users based on the devices that they use and
>may pass the information to Google for tracking purposes.
>
>Martin Brinkmann at gHacks

Google really tried to hide this change. The main support article
talking about the reasoning behind the change is intentionally obtuse
and nebulous, and doesn’t even link to the actual policy changes being
implemented – which are found in a separate document. Google doesn’t
highlight its changes there, so you have to compare the two versions
of the policy yourself.

Google claims this change has to be implemented because of 'advances
in privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) such as on-device processing,
trusted execution environments, and secure multi-party computation'
and 'the rise of new ad-supported devices and platforms'. What I think
this word salad means is that users are regaining a modicum of privacy
with some specific privacy-preserving features in certain operating
systems and on certain devices, and that the use of dedicated, siloed
streaming services is increasing, which is harder for Google and
advertisers to track.

In other words, Google is relaxing its rules on fingerprinting because
we’re all getting more conscious about privacy"

Motor1: "Hydrogen-powered vehicles are already here. Internal
combustion hydrogen engines are being used in commercial applications
in Europe, while numerous automakers globally have patents for
hydrogen engines for both commercial and performance
applications. Just like gas or diesel mills, air is mixed with fuel to
make horsepower. And Cummins already has a special turbocharger to
force-feed these new engines, called the CCS H2 ICE.

It's a variable geometry turbo designed to 'meet the unique
requirements of hydrogen engines,' according to Cummins. The exact
details of the design aren't shared, though it's said to incorporate a
bespoke aerodynamic design that caters best to hydrogen, which has a
lower density compared to gasoline or diesel. A by-product of burning
hydrogen is water, and being a turbocharger, it's driven by the
engine's exhaust system. As such, the turbo is also designed to handle
that water both in terms of power production and longevity"

Jews from the Caucuses (see the Asimov link below) converted into the
religion for political reasons. They made being overtly different a
key part of their political identity. If the Jews descending from this
group (mostly in Europe then US) has any common feature, it is
this... Being different, and overtly so because it helped them in the
area where they came from. The shtick obviously did not help them as
much in 30-40s Germany.

Morgan Freeman:

---

Racial attributes do not define culture. Immigrants do contribute, can
cause changes, but their kids will assimilate into the whole, not the
little parts their parents brought in. Everyone is a little Irish, a
little black, no matter the race. Religious subcultures cannot remain
isolated either, Jews especially come to mind here who proudly claim
their extremely distinct. They are not.

---

Whichever country you were at between ages 0-7 you have its culture.
You are in it, you are it. Child born to immigrant Jamaican parents
will never be Jamaican. Same is true for others.

Iraq, Syria surely have their own singular culture. Culture code
homogenizes existing elements into one, from birth kids would
assimilate into that. I'm talking about politics; when people feel
threatened, what group do they take up arms with?

---

It's not about me wanting secterianism in Syria, or Iraq. Secterianism
already exist, and players position themselves according to it. If you
are making only moralistic arguments against secterianism, you are
missing a large part of what's going on.

Pikkety: "Biden is not wrong [about the dangers of oligarchy]. The
issue is that he has done little to oppose the oligarchic drift taking
place both in his country and globally. In the 1930s, his predecessor
Roosevelt, also deeply concerned about such trends, did not stop at
making speeches. Under his leadership, Democrats implemented a robust
policy of reducing social inequalities (with tax rates on the highest
incomes nearing 70%–80% for half a century) and investing in public
infrastructure, health, and education...

In the 1980s, Republican Ronald Reagan, deftly playing on nationalism
and a feeling of catching up, undertook to dismantle Roosevelt’s New
Deal. The problem was that Democrats, far from defending this legacy,
actually helped legitimize and solidify Reagan’s turn, notably under
the Clinton (1993-2001) and Obama (2009-2017) administrations.."

He has some pieces right but they are all put together
crooked. Democracy is broken in US, true, so bad a monarch would be
better, also true. But the culprit is corporate power, not
bureucracy. Reps *and* Democrats allowed that to happen, starting w/
Carter, then w/ Clinton, black Bill Clinton, so on.

That is not the right criticism against Bitcoin or cyrpto. No money in
history, including gold, had intrinsic value. *Politics* gives value,
it decides what is valueable as currency. Politics did that for gold,
the king demanded taxes to be paid in gold, dug up gold from mines he
controlled (this is key) and gave it to his soldiers to spend, and
voila! The public rushed to sell stuff to the army to get the golds to
pay taxes. Two birds with one stone: army is supplied, the king
controls money.
