<p>"As first-time homebuyers across the country face higher-than-ever
costs, California Rep. Ro Khanna is going after one of the biggest
winners of the housing crunch: Wall Street landlords. On Tuesday,
Khanna reintroduced the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act, a bill that
seeks to deter large institutional investors from scooping up
single-family homes...</p>
<p>In the first half of 2024, one in four 'low-priced' homes were
purchased by investors, according to the realty company Redfin. In
that same time, the percentage of Americans with a 'high degree of
concern' about housing costs rose to 69%, per data collected by the
Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>If passed, Khanna’s bill would increase taxes on future home
acquisitions made by companies and private equity funds that hold over
$100 million in assets and bar government-supported lenders from
backing new mortgages for such purchases. Khanna argued that
preventing large institutional investors from treating housing as a
speculative asset would ease an affordability crisis where demand for
housing has far outstripped supply"</p>

<p>For the 2006 Supes movie I remember B. Singer was going around saying
"Donner's vision! Donner's vision!", and the movie flopped, I dont
think he was able to capture Donner's vision, or if it would have
mattered if he did. The lighthearted tone Gunn is aiming for can work,
was that Donner's vision? Whatever. Let's hope it all works out.</p>

<p>The Daily Economy: "[2022/09] Imagine if officials at your local bank
announced that they would start surveilling your public speech and
messages, and would deduct money from your account if they didn’t like
what you said. PayPal, the online payment services provider, unleashed
a furor last week after announcing just such a scheme...</p>
<p>In published amendments to its Acceptable Use Policy, the company
informed its customers, 'You may not use the PayPal service for
activities that ... involve the sending, posting, or publication of
any messages, content, or materials that, in PayPal’s sole discretion
…  promote misinformation.' PayPal claimed the right to seize $2500
from customers’ accounts for any purported violations.</p>
<p>PayPal’s.. former CEO David Marcus [responded:] 'PayPal’s

<p>Molly White: "Not just one bad apple: FTX's practices were business as
usual in crypto.. Over a year after Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial, perhaps
one of the most memorable moments to stick with me was an unexpected
one: a brief exchange between prosecutors and BlockFi founder Zac
Prince.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>BlockFi's Zac Prince: [With] crypto firms, it was much less common to have audited balance sheets because of issues with getting audits as a cryptocurrency firm.</p>
<p>Prosecutor: Just to be clear, some of the balance sheets you received from crypto firms were what is called unaudited balance sheets.</p>
<p>Prince: I would say the majority of balance sheets that we received from cryptocurrency firms were unaudited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This casual statement about lending hundreds of millions based on
scrawled estimates and a 'trust me, bro' underscored the deception in
crypto executives’ post-collapse claims that FTX was a rare bad actor
with aberrant business practices"</p>

<p>Royal Astronomical Society: "Dark energy 'doesn’t exist'.. The new
evidence supports the 'timescape' model of cosmic expansion, which
doesn't have a need for dark energy because the differences in
stretching light aren't the result of an accelerating Universe but
instead a consequence of how we calibrate time and distance...</p>
<p>Professor David Wiltshire, who led the study, said: 'Our findings show
that we do not need dark energy to explain why the Universe appears to
expand at an accelerating rate.. Dark energy is a misidentification of
variations in the kinetic energy of expansion, which is not uniform in
a Universe as lumpy as the one we actually live in.'</p>
<p>He added: 'The research provides compelling evidence that may resolve
some of the key questions around the quirks of our expanding
cosmos... With new data, the Universe's biggest mystery could be
settled by the end of the decade'" via @AntonPetrov</p>

<p>NYT: "[2015] The employees who kept the data systems humming in the
vast Walt Disney fantasy fief did not suspect trouble when they were
suddenly summoned to meetings with their boss... ome were performing
so well that they thought they had been called in for bonuses...
Instead, about 250 Disney employees were told in late October that
they would be laid off. Many of their jobs were transferred to
immigrants on temporary visas for highly skilled technical workers,
who were brought in by an outsourcing firm based in India. Over the
next three months, some Disney employees were required to train their
replacements to do the jobs they had lost.</p>
<p>'I just couldn’t believe they could fly people in to sit at our desks
and take over our jobs exactly,' said one former worker, an American
in his 40s who remains unemployed since his last day at Disney on
Jan. 30. 'It was so humiliating to train somebody else to take over
your job. I still can’t grasp it.'"</p>

<hr />
<p>Andersen, <em>Evil Geniuses</em>: "And 1978 was also a tipping-point year in
the economic right’s crusade to persuade people that because
government now sucked, all taxes paid to all governments by everyone,
no matter how wealthy, were way too high and also sucked. The
overwhelmingly Democratic Congress overwhelmingly passed and the
Democratic president [Carter] signed into law a huge reduction in
taxes on income from selling stocks, capital gains—a definitive turn
toward making extra-sure the rich got richer faster..</p>
<p>During the 1980s, federal antitrust enforcement budgets and cases were
cut back to the levels of thirty and fifty years earlier. A true
libertarian OG who wanted to privatize Social Security, Greenspan
became Federal Reserve chairman in 1987 (and stayed in the job into
the new century). Democratic presidents now governed like liberal
Republicans, instructing Americans that 'all the legislation in the
world can’t fix what’s wrong with America' (Carter) and that 'the era
of big government is over' (Clinton)..</p>
<p>In 1977 President Carter declined to work hard for a bill that
would’ve given construction workers greater power to strike, and it
was defeated in the House, where Democrats had a two-to-one
majority. The next year the same Congress was considering a labor law
change that would’ve made it easier for all workers to unionize.  The
CEOs of fully unionized GM and GE were disinclined to oppose the bill,
but their fellow Business Roundtable member who ran the barely
unionized Sears persuaded them to lobby against it—and capitalist
solidarity carried the day. It too was defeated. Carter and most
Democrats shrugged"</p>
<hr />
<p>Politico: "Jimmy Carter Wasn’t a Liberal.. These misconceptions seem
plausible today because Carter’s four-decade post-presidency was
notably more left-leaning than his presidency ever was. The
ex-president’s peace missions to North Korea and Cuba and his frequent
criticisms of U.S. policies regarding everything from the Palestinians
(whose treatment by Israel he famously likened to apartheid) to
domestic surveillance (“unprecedented violations of our rights to
privacy”) positioned Carter well to the left of Republican and
Democratic successors alike...</p>
<p>In truth, the pendulum started swinging to the [economic] right before
Carter took office, and continued doing so under Carter’s
presidency. Reagan didn’t change the pendulum’s direction; he just
accelerated its speed...</p>
<p>Carter, a former governor in the conservative Deep South, preferred to
point out that there was much government <em>couldn’t</em> do. 'There is a
limit to the role and the function of government,' Carter said in his
1978 State of the Union speech. 'Government cannot solve our
problems'"</p>
