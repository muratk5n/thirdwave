<h1>Week 3</h1>
<p>FCW: "On January 10th, the first batch of 406 hydrogen fuel cell
sanitation vehicles equipped with GWM Hydrogen-FTXT's hydrogen power
system were officially delivered to customers, marking the successful
implementation of GWM's first 'hundred-unit level' hydrogen sanitation
vehicle demonstration application scenario in Baoding, China.</p>
<p>This batch of hydrogen sanitation vehicles includes three main models:
hydrogen sweeping and washing vehicles, hydrogen cleaning vehicles,
and hydrogen high-pressure flushing vehicles. They were jointly
developed by GWM Hydrogen-FTXT in collaboration with three well-known
Chinese commercial vehicle manufacturers - Changzheng, Yutong, and
Dongfeng. All vehicles are equipped with GWM Hydrogen-FTXT's
self-developed commercial vehicle fuel cell system and hydrogen
storage system. Compared to electric sanitation vehicles, they have
significant advantages such as faster fuel replenishment and better
adaptability to high and low-temperature environments. It only takes
5-8 minutes to complete hydrogen refueling, and a single refueling
allows for continuous operation of over 10 hours"</p>

<p>But everyone says Keanu is such a nice guy, we should not say bad

<p>We do not talk about any material concerns here, bunch of Woke shit,
coupled with anti-government propaganda (what Matrix is truly all

<hr />
<p>NEXT QUESTION</p>
<hr />
<p>I remember another interview around 2000 they asked Keanu about the
Seattle anti-globalisation protests, and how that might relate to the
first movie, he just cuts off the intervier, says "next question!". </p>
<hr />
<p>I watched the cast interview for Matrix 4, they were discussing
whether "a man plugging into the Matrix as a woman" would be <em>so
scandalous</em> the studio would think nixing it... Imagine that.. with
all the problems in the world, this is where you choose to focus? Here
is the level of rebelliousness of their art... All-blue Dem dimwits</p>

<p>Anderson, <em>Private Government</em>: "Consider some facts about how
employers today control their workers. Walmart prohibits employees
from exchanging casual remarks while on duty, calling this 'time
theft.' Apple inspects the personal belongings of their retail
workers, who lose up to a half-hour of unpaid time every day as they
wait in line to be searched. Tyson prevents its poultry workers from
using the bathroom. Some have been forced to urinate on themselves,
while their supervisors mock them. About half of U.S. employees have
been subject to suspicionless drug screening by their employers.
Millions are pressured by their employers to support particular
political causes or candidates. If the U.S. government imposed such
regulations on us, we would rightly protest that our constitutional
rights were being violated. But American workers have no such rights
against their bosses"</p>

<p>The whole worldview is patently dumb, and, hilariously, loud and

DNA. That base is working against them now. You need to fight this

<p>Note the brash, brazenness of this neolib delusion. Muckers live in a

<p>Philips, <em>Wealth and Democracy</em>: "Using consumption as a gauge works
to overstate popular well-being, all the more so because its
measurements ignore assets and leave out debt burdens, which climbed
most during periods like the 1920s, 1960s, and the 1980s and 1990s
precisely for those least able to afford them.  By an even more
expansive view, consumption had become part of the new edifice of
democracy-as-market. By driving a car, buying a movie ticket, or
watching a television commercial, U.S. consumers participated every
day in the democracy of the marketplace, or so suggested the editorial
pages of the Wall Street Journal. What was widely purchased was, ipso
facto, democratically approved. Buying and selling, indeed, was a
large part of what democracy was about...</p>
<p>Markets would become the democratic rulers in the nineties, said
banker Walter Wriston: 'Markets are voting machines; they function by
taking referenda.'  Ultimately even the proletariat would 'fight to
reduce government power over the corporations for which they work,
organizations far more democratic, collegial and tolerant than distant
state bureaucracies.' Broadcaster Rush Limbaugh, too, wanted to 'let
the marketplace rule.' Former House speaker Newt Gingrich dreamed
about the possibility of establishing a 'consumer-directed
government,' once even suggesting that major questions could be
resolved by simply asking 'our major multinational corporations for
advice'"</p>

<hr />
<p>Stevenson, <em>The Trading Game</em>: "[2011, the presenter] had a bunch of
charts. He went through them one at a time. On each one was the fiscal
situation of a single country. Italy. Spain. Greece.
Portugal. Ireland. Also the United Kingdom, the US, Japan. They were
all variations on the same story. All these governments were spending
more than their income year after year and their debts were growing.
If things kept going in the same direction, the interest rates on
their debts would start rising. People would stop lending to them, and
they’d have to sell their assets. That would be bad...</p>
<p>What I couldn’t get out of my head was this sense of similarity. It
was the same. The government of Spain, the government of America, the
government of Japan... Outgoings more than their income. Losing the
ability to borrow money. More and more income going into servicing
debt.  Losing their assets. The situation was the same...</p>
<p>But it came up against the economics though.. We’re in a monetary
system. The whole thing always has to be in balance. For everyone
who’s in debt, there’s someone who’s in credit. For everybody losing
money, there’s somebody who’s gaining. The whole system is designed to
be in balance. Not only that, but what about the houses?  What about
the stock market that was rising and rising? These assets weren’t
disappearing. But if we didn’t own them, if the people didn’t own
them, and the governments didn’t own them...Then who did?..  [T]hat
was the moment that it hit me, [I was] surrounded by
millionaires. [They owned the debt, along with most of the other
assets]"</p>
<hr />
<p>Countries, states reducing services, being in debt is an issue
involving taxation. Neolibs kept talking down gov, reduced their
spending, decreased biz regulation, well, now you <em>burn in fire</em>.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why the decrease in tax collection? Maybe CA should've kept it at 2022
levels and increase gov services, so there would be more firefighting
capability.  </p>

<p>Chollet: "[2024/12] OpenAI o3 ARC-AGI Results [which measures
abstraction capability].. OpenAI's new o3 model.. mark[s] a
qualitative shift in AI capabilities compared to the prior limitations
of LLMs. o3 is a system capable of adapting to tasks it has never
encountered before..  Of course, such generality comes at a steep
cost, and wouldn't quite be economical yet: you could pay a human to
solve ARC-AGI tasks for roughly 5 dollars per task (we know, we did
that), while consuming mere cents in energy. Meanwhile o3 requires
$17-20 per task in the low-compute mode...</p>
<p>o3's improvement over the GPT series proves that architecture is
everything. You couldn't throw more compute at GPT-4 and get these
results. Simply scaling up the things we were doing from 2019 to 2023
– take the same architecture, train a bigger version on more data – is
not enough...</p>
<p>[But] I don't think o3 is AGI yet. o3 still fails on some very easy
tasks, indicating fundamental differences with human intelligence...
Furthermore, early data points suggest that the upcoming ARC-AGI-2
benchmark will still pose a significant challenge to o3, potentially
reducing its score to under 30% even at high compute (while a smart
human would still be able to score over 95% with no training). This
demonstrates the continued possibility of creating challenging,
unsaturated benchmarks without having to rely on expert domain
knowledge"</p>
<hr />
<p>I thought as much.. differentiability is used to find optimum point of
a cost function. If program has to learn programs however, rather than
a function, differentiation might not make sense for that. Deep
Learning built a massive expertise around automatic differentiation,
backpropagation that might not apply to this new approach.</p>
<hr />
<p>"[E]xtending neural networks with more programmatic elements
necessarily means abandoning the idea of end-to-end
differentiability. An example is Chollet's observation that 'if
machine learning models become more like programs, then they will
mostly no longer be differentiable—certainly, these programs will
still leverage continuous geometric layers as subroutines, which will
be differentiable, but the model as a whole would not be. As a result,
using backpropagation to adjust weight values in a fixed, hard-coded
network, cannot be the method of choice for training models in the
future—at least, it cannot be the whole story'"</p>
<hr />
<p>Chollet argues "program synthesis" is the way to go for AGI. AI needs
to learn programs rather than representations of word clouds (current
apprach). If programs can be learned, AI can adapt to new situations
better, we are a step closer to true AGI.</p>

<p>James Woods says when officials tell you to evacuate don't wait
around, leave! I guess he is saying <em>listen to the government</em>. Wasn't
he some kind of Reaganite right-winger who wants small government? I
guess during emergency everyone remembers there is such a thing as gov
whose presence is not tied to profit motive, and is there to help you.</p>
