Neoliberalism has dominated economic thinking in the UK and across the

Rising poverty, broken housing markets, stagnant wages, failing
pensions, and growing inequality."</p>

<p>Freer access would be good, but in the current geo environment
everyone perceives things differently... Iran is a demonized actor by
the West, TR/AZ is their stooge, so them talking abt access is
perceived as an attack by the next-door neighbor. Sad.</p>
<hr />
<p>"[06/15] Tehran has announced it successfully thwarted plans to
establish the Zangezur Corridor, a proposed land route linking
Azerbaijan to Turkey via Armenia’s Syunik province, which Iranian
officials view as a major geopolitical threat. In a televised
interview on June 10 with Tasnim News Agency, Ali Akbar Velayati, the
senior foreign policy adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, warned that the corridor was “a geopolitical maneuver
disguised as a transportation project”, intended to isolate Iran and
contain Russia by severing critical regional connections. Velayati
alleged that the corridor, if completed, would have blocked Iran’s
only direct land access to Europe through Armenia, undermining
Tehran’s strategic position in the South Caucasus."</p>
<hr />
<p>AFAIK Iran is against that shit</p>
<hr />
<p>Wiki: "The Zangezur corridor is a concept for a transport corridor
which, if implemented, would give Azerbaijan unimpeded access to
Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic without Armenian checkpoints via
Armenia's Syunik Province and, in a broad sense, for the geopolitical
corridor that would connect Turkey to [AZ]. The concept was not part
of the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire agreement but was introduced to
geopolitical lexicon later by Ilham Aliyev.. Armenia has steadily
objected to it, asserting that 'corridor logic' deviates from the
ceasefire statement, and that it is a form of propaganda"</p>
