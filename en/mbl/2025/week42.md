James Ellars: "The idea of having to 'earn a living' implies that, by
default, you don't actually deserve to be alive."

---

Buckminster Fuller: ‚ÄúWe should do away with the absolutely specious
notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that
one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough
capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely
right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep
inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be
employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian
Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have
inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors
to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go
back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking
about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a
living.‚Äù

Social media companies run analysis like the one below all the
time. It's pretty standard. In order to suggest friends, they can look
for central characters, look for cliques,..

Mark Weinberger, no.. the ring leader cannot be Jew, it has to be Anglo.
The tail does not wag the dog. 

---

If I had to pick a shadowy surface state ring leader / MIC decision
maker from this list, I would chose Ronald D. Sugar or Alex Gorsky.

---

Betweenness centrality measures how often a corporate board director
lies on the shortest path between two other directors. A high score
identifies critical connectors or "brokers" who bridge different,
otherwise separate groups of directors/companies. People with the
highest influence would appear in the list.

---

```python
centrality = nx.betweenness_centrality(G)
centrality_by_name = {
    G.nodes[director_id].get('name', director_id): score
    for director_id, score in centrality.items()
}

sorted_centrality = sorted(
    centrality_by_name.items(), 
    key=lambda item: item[1], 
    reverse=True
)

print(f"Total directors (nodes) in the graph: {G.number_of_nodes()}")
print(f"Total connections (edges) in the graph: {G.number_of_edges()}")
print("\nTop 10 Directors by Betweenness Centrality:")
top_10_centrality = dict(sorted_centrality[:10])
print(json.dumps(top_10_centrality, indent=4))
```

```text

The network

```python
from itertools import combinations
import hjson, networkx as nx, json

with open('theyrorgs.json', 'r') as f:
    orgs_data = hjson.load(f)
    
with open('theyrdirs.json', 'r') as f:
    dirs_data = hjson.load(f)
G = nx.Graph()

organizations = orgs_data.get('Orgs', {})

for org_id, org_info in organizations.items():
    director_ids = org_info.get('d', [])
    for director1_id, director2_id in combinations(director_ids, 2):
        G.add_edge(director1_id, director2_id)
directors = dirs_data.get('Dirs', {})
name_mapping = {
    dir_id: dir_info.get('n', dir_id) 
    for dir_id, dir_info in directors.items()
}
nx.set_node_attributes(G, name_mapping, 'name')

If two people are sitting on the same board, we assume them
"connected", create the whole structure that way and run the rest of
the computation on that graph.

---

I always wanted to analyse data from the *They Rule* site
(theyrule.net), the site that tracks corporate boards and the members
on them. It turns out their raw data is in a Javascript file, in
`/static/js/main.6ef84500.js`.  Reverse engineered it - [orgs](mbl/2025/theyrorgs.json), [directors](mbl/2025/theyrdirs.json).  
With a little preprocessing, you create the social graph via
`networkx` and process its connections.

Perhaps that will help in their assimilation.. well, they are already
assimilated actually, I mean will help with them *accepting* their
assimilation more, realizing they do not constitute a seperate,
identifiably distinct culture within another. According to Clotaire
Rapaille cultural transmission does not occur through ritual, or
assuming labels, it is organic and takes place through osmosis.

I believe Jews who do not accept their assimilation (a big source of
neuroticism) also provide an attack vector for Israeli propaganda, and
indirectly the fearsome military-industrial complex. Less of an attack
vector, the better for the world.

WaPo: "More U.S. Jews shield identity in public amid antisemitism

The aid flotillas were a PR nightmare for Israel. I'm glad they
attempted to reach Gaza and did not give up.

IC: "[T]he Sumud Flotilla also deserves credit for creating momentum
for the ceasefire.. Sumud began as a small fleet of hope ‚Äî dozens of
boats carrying activists, doctors, and humanitarian cargo, setting
sail from ports around the world to challenge Israel‚Äôs blockade on
Gaza.

Now, after months of confrontation, detention, and diplomatic fallout,
the flotilla‚Äôs central message has unexpectedly materialized in
political reality: Israel and Hamas have agreed to a provisional
ceasefire that will allow humanitarian aid to flow freely into Gaza
and has facilitated the release of hostages and prisoners."

Considering the zeitgeist is Nazism the right focus for this cinematic
universe? Extreme right-wing is not the main problem for US, or the
world, extreme wealth inequality caused by errant neoliberalism is.  A
destroyed middle-class can be led towards various outlets, fighting
symptoms is not helpful.

---

Overman was literally raised by Adolf Hitler, according to DC canon.

---

Peacemaker S2 characters were off.. like Grillo's role. Is he being
set up for something bigger (it's not him, it is an impersonator)? His
son, is he Overman (the Nazi Superman) in his universe? Not a big fan
of 'other dimension' tropes, but if the storytelling is good enough,
one could go along... PM S2 fell short there.

"US Justice Department opens inquiry into First Brands
collapse.. First Brands, which makes filters, brakes and lighting
systems for the automotive industry, filed for bankruptcy protection
last month after its lenders began investigating irregularities in the
company's financial reporting. The company has $11.6 billion in total
liabilities..

Financial troubles at First Brands and the recent bankruptcy of
subprime lender Tricolor Holdings, have rattled debt investors and
stoked fears of broader stress in corporate debt markets, according to
bondholders and bankruptcy experts. Some of the financial firms
exposed to First Brands include Jefferies (JEF.N), opens new tab,
which disclosed $715 million in exposure through Leucadia Asset
Management, and UBS (UBSG.S), opens new tab, which is assessing
exposure on more than 500 million tied to the company."

Is the Nobel commitee captured by the US corporate complex (esp. its
military wing)? Trump was expecting an award but it was given to an
opposition figure in Venezuella, a country US is signaling it might
invade. It's like the commitee told Trump "you wait in line, prove
your worth to us, if you invade Venezuella maybe you get your award
next year 'for bringing peace and democracy' to Venezuella"

down as one of the more ironic tributes, as Machado has been quick to
turn her Peace Prize award into one more weapon of war."

How could stablecoin become every day currency? Organically, slowly
perhaps, or a crisis can be invented, ATM's can be down, banking
network is clogged / attacked, there is an artificial panic.. boom.
People are channeled towards this new thing, "hey it is safer". The
switch is made.

---

Right. Their tokens are backed by treasuries, the more they issue the
more treasuries they have to buy.. And now imagine stablecoins
becoming everyday currency, as in all your spending having to go
through them.. That would generate massive demand for stablecoins
therefore US debt / treasuries, wouldn't it?  Then you monetize in the
back end, $35 trillion debt, poof. Gone.

\#Ukraine 10/05 - 10/13

[[-]](ukrdata/map39.html)

---

$35 trillion of debt would be a driving factor. USG could say "we
can't pay this whole thing, we will pay back only half". But that
would create panic. Via the stablecoin scheme they will spread the
debt across time, across people, turning it into everyday money, then
they can monetize this debt/money instrument at any pace they want.

---

If the US stablecoin scheme spreads all over the world, it will create
even more demand for US debt, but when the US devalues, those
countries could end up suckers, they'd pay 100 but end up with 50
worth of "stablecoin" value. The scheme has a certain appeal from US
POV. But I agree with "the rest" suspecting it, smelling something
fishy.

---

He must be referring to a recent crypto bill... it says USG will
support short-term bond / cash backed "stablecoins", the coins are
backed with US debt, US bond one-to-one, so they are legally stable
hence the name. That can help USG: If such stablecoins, eg USDT,
become widely used in US as digital money, every coin holder would
automatically become the holder of US debt, gov would be creating
massive demand for its debt, its financing becomes easier.

Reportedly there is another leg for this scheme, banks have about 4
trillion of dollars sitting at the FED, currently kept out of the
circulation, sitting there only to balance their books. The new bill
will allow the use of that cash for the issuence of new stablecoins
and that will certainly cause the dollar to depreciate. The
speculation continues, other countries sensed this coming, they are
dumping the dollar, piling up non-US assets like precious metals at a
rapid pace bcz even though there is no official "money printing" the
use of that cash is still debt monetization and more of it can arrive
later.

move it into the crypto cloud, devalue it‚Äîand start from scratch,' he
said. 'That‚Äôs the reality for those who are so enthusiastic about

Year 2000 people who thought they had a good chance of improving their
standard of living was at about 70%. In 2015 the percentage fell to
50%. It is now at 25%. These numbers correlate with rising wealth
inequality in the populace. As a consequence few think working hard
will get them anywhere in life. The system is rigged against them.

Hinton, "the godfather of AI" is mostly talking out of his ass these

everything... it didn't go anywhere. His best days are clearly behind

---

It needs to be stressed, LLMs operate in a "latent space", in the
compressed knowledge representation of the world, and when asked
something they can *always* generate something from that latent
space. I can factorize a matrix $A$ into various components even with
missing data, get a "reduced dimension" representation, and always
recreate the whole matrix from those components even fill in the
missing values whether the prediction is completely right or not. The
generation can be close, but not always necessarily accurate. This is
what they mean when the hallucination is embedded in the math.

---

Retrieval-Augmented Generation is a good idea.. you can have LLM index
your personal notes, personal documents (obviously orgs can do the
same on their internal knowledge base), just like LLMs indexed the
whole Internet and books, they can just add your stuff on top of that,
then you can "ask", or query that knowledge base silo in plain
English.

---

LLM is glorified search.. LLMs are ok at that, I never said they
weren't, but remember for regular search we don't expect perfection,
or crazy accuracy, simply the top 10 or 20 items be relevant, same is
true here.
