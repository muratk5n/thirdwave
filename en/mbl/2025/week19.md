Sarah Miller: "The Ridiculous 'Everything‚Äôs Gotten Better'
Guys.. Globalized capitalism may be destroying the world, but it has a
great PR department. It‚Äôs astounding how many people still accept
Steven Pinker‚Äôs distorted claim that everything has gotten better
under capitalism..

It‚Äôs true that life expectancy has doubled in the US since the
1880s. But that was thanks mainly to cleaner water and better sewage
systems, and then to antibiotics, vaccines, and perhaps blood pressure
reducers. Most of that had worked its magic by 1960 and resulted from
government-sponsored programs. Since then, life expectancy gains first
slowed and have now gone into reverse.

If things have indisputably gotten better over the last 70‚Äì100 years,
how come we‚Äôre all ready to vote out practically anybody who‚Äôs in
power? How come life expectancy is falling again in the US? There‚Äôs a
war in Europe? We‚Äôre looking for escapes from reality everywhere from
sports to meditation? Globalization is collapsing?"

ScienceBlog: "Australian researchers have developed an innovative
system that transforms ordinary human urine into clean hydrogen fuel
at significantly lower energy costs than traditional
methods... Scientists at the University of Adelaide have created two
groundbreaking electrolysis systems that harness urea found in urine
to produce hydrogen while reducing electricity consumption by up to
27% compared to water-based hydrogen production. This approach not
only makes green hydrogen economically competitive with fossil
fuel-derived alternatives but also creates an elegant solution for
wastewater treatment, potentially revolutionizing renewable energy
production while addressing environmental challenges."

The quaternion rule $ijk=-1$ as axiom seems somewhat arbitrary. That
statement needs to be tied to something else...  Fletcher Dunn and
others had a good idea, $i,j,k$ are 4 x 4 special matrices forming a
*basis*, whose square, multiplication gives the results in Hamilton's
rules. Selecting a basis is more natural than declaring a random
statement, and coming up with two new imaginery numbers.

If these numbers are correct, Indian airspace is defenseless against
Pak attacks. PAF has 50 of these things and want to buy more,
including 5th gen J-20s.

---

The exchange was not a dogfight, Pakis shot the missiles outside of
the visual range. That means their integrated radar, recon systems
were better than the other side's, they detected and shot first. The
missiles worked they have their own guidance and were not fooled by
evasion measures. Pak arsenal is better integrated whereas India's are
a patchwork of different solutions put together. The planes lost on
their side were Rafales, SU-30 and a Mig-29. Both J-10C and Rafale are
4.5 gen.

Financial Times: "The west‚Äôs shameful silence on Gaza.. After 19
months of conflict that has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians
and drawn accusations of war crimes against Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu
is once more preparing to escalate Israel‚Äôs offensive in Gaza... This
would be a disaster for 2.2mn Gazans who have already endured
unfathomable suffering. Each new offensive makes it harder not to
suspect that the ultimate goal of Netanyahu‚Äôs far-right coalition is
to ensure Gaza is uninhabitable and drive Palestinians from their
land. For two months, Israel has blocked delivery of all aid into the
strip. Child malnutrition rates are rising"

Abramson, *The Guardian*: "[2016] The Clintons turned the Democratic
party over to donors. Can it recover?..[H]edge fund managers and media
titans.. had built the most formidable fundraising network ever seen
in American politics. They pumped more than $4bn into various Clinton
campaigns and related political and charitable groups over four
decades. Many of them have been cutting huge checks since Bill
Clinton‚Äôs first presidential campaign in 1992. In 2016, they expected
their 1.2bn dollar infusion to catapult Hillary Clinton back into the
White House and were astonished, like the rest of the country‚Äôs elite,
to see all that money go down the tubes...

Back in 1991, I was one of the only reporters with Bill Clinton at one
of his early Hollywood shakedowns. I saw how he loved schmoozing with
rich people, how his body language literally changed as he mixed with
the ultra-rich.. Bill and Hillary Clinton are the people responsible
for turning the Democratic party into the party of Wall Street and
their glitzy friends. During his time in office, Bill Clinton did
little to change a campaign finance system that has always been
fundamentally at odds with the party‚Äôs egalitarian message"

Jake Sullivan: "Regardless, despite Ukrainian tactical successes of
using these [advanced] weapons beginning in October 2023, Sullivan
said they were not game-changers... 'We ended up providing Ukraine
with a very significant number of these systems down to the level
where, again, we basically have no more to give,' Sullivan
surmised. 'And the idea that they made a major difference
operationally in the war has not been borne out by the evidence. So I
think a lot has been put on this ATACMS decision to suggest, "Oh, if
only you‚Äôd given ATACMS, the war would have turned out totally
differently." And yet, the experience of the use of ATACMS by Ukraine
on the battlefield, I think, suggests that that is not, in fact, the
case'"

---

Ledbetter, *Unwarrented Influence*: "One reason the [MIC] debate has
moved so little in the past twenty-five years is the lack of a clear
alternative to the MIC. The problem isn‚Äôt theory‚Äîthere‚Äôs plenty of
theory. But the most visionary work on converting to a civilian
economy has usually come from expectations‚Äîalways dashed‚Äîthat changing
geopolitics would bring about large cuts in military spending. It may
be time for critics of the MIC to abandon that fantasy.  Barring some
extremely unlikely events‚Äîa dramatic reduction in perceived threats to
the United States, a wholesale rejection of the role of global
superpower, or a protracted economic crisis that makes military
spending impossible‚Äîit is difficult to see how the United States would
be sufficiently motivated to eliminate its MIC, let alone replace it
with something superior. The United States for the foreseeable future
will continue to spend hundreds of billions of dollars every year for
military purposes.

Scandals that spotlight ugly issues of military procurement‚Äîsuch as
the $1,868 toilet seat and similar outlandish spending that surfaced
during the 1980s‚Äîoften create temporary impetus for limited
reform. Such scandals tend to flare up either when the country is
relatively at peace or after a military engagement becomes
protracted. Many legislative remedies have been passed in the wake of
scandals, such as increased requirements for competitive bidding and
limits on the revolving door between departing Defense Department
personnel and contractors. But scandals have been a recurring feature
of the political and military landscape at least since the 1930s, and
their reform power recedes as soon as another large conflict looms.

Hence, in the view of many critics, the size and sins of the MIC have
grown, not shrunk. As has been shown repeatedly in recent decades, it
is exceedingly difficult for the government to take even such
seemingly simple actions as closing a few military bases. It is one of
the pernicious features of a military-industrial complex that it is
nearly impervious to democratic reform"

Anglo-friend Israel threw in their support immediately.

India always had a balanced approach but it is a right rope to walk
on at the moment.

Was India perceived as too buddy-buddy w/ the Anglo and somebody
wanted to give a message..? There were attempts on upgrading rels with
US recently, and right after the India response to Kashmiri attack, IN
signed a massive trade deal w UK. Major powers of Brics all have
issues with US at the moment.. The attack is obscene in its daring
that it has to be some kind of message.

Hughes: "Instead of wallowing in chaos, as if our job is to give the
market what 'it' demands, we can harness markets to work for our
needs. 'Capitalism needs to be cared for by policymakers,' Secretary
of State Marco Rubio recently wrote. 'Our economy is supposed to work
for our nation; our nation does not work for our economy'"

---

Hughes, *Marketcrafters*: "The stubborn persistence of the language of
'market failure' and 'government intervention' reinforces a faulty
vision of how the economy works. There is no sequence where markets
exist first, before a governance structure. Just as there was no state
of nature where humans existed without a social order, there was never
a time when markets flourished without a political order. The core
flaw of the 'market failure' paradigm is that it casts the government
as a reactive parental figure‚Äîone who merely corrects missteps or
offers aid after harm has occurred. In this view, the government‚Äôs
role is limited to 'intervening' in markets only after problems arise,
much like a parent scolding a child for misbehaving on the
playground. This notion of state interference with natural market
forces reinforces a false market-government dichotomy, sets up the
state in the role of nefarious nanny, and constrains its capacity to
foster widespread prosperity"

Dessler: "This study focuses on the Electric Reliability Council of
Texas (ERCOT) electricity market in Texas and demonstrates how the
increase in temperature due to climate change is already driving large
increases in electricity demand and total electricity costs. Results
show that, compared to a 1950‚Äì80 baseline climate, electricity demand
in 2023 was 1.9 GW (3.9%) higher because of the extreme temperatures
of that year - climate change contributed 47% of this increase, with
the rest coming from short-term climate variability"

If singularities are eliminated from the field equations, black hole
hypothesis is automatically debunked.

---

Wolfgang Kundt: "There is now a group of young theorists in the world
who think that the ultimate field equations should not allow for
singularities, because they describe measurements, and our
measurements never get something singular. Our measurements get
something finite, otherwise it's not a physical. So good theories are
free of singularities, [the ones with singularities] must not be
admitted. And we notice now we don't need them, we don't need them
because our neutron stars stay regular. Our measurements.. will stay
regular, and finite"

Doctorow: "To make a computer ignore its owner.. the manufacturer has
to build in a bunch of software countermeasures to stop you from
reconfiguring or installing software of your choosing on it. And sure,
that software might be able to withstand the attempts of normies like
you and me to bypass it, but given that we‚Äôd all rather have the final
say over how our computers work, someone is gonna figure out how to
get around that software. I mean, show me a 10-foot fence and I‚Äôll
show you an 11-foot ladder, right?

To stop that from happening, Congress passed the 1998 Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. Despite the word ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù appearing in
the name of the law, it‚Äôs not really about defending *copyright*, it‚Äôs
about defending *business models*. Under Section 1201 of the DMCA,
helping someone bypass a software lock is a felony punishable by a
five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine (for a first
offense). That‚Äôs true whether or not any copyright infringement takes
place"

Kennedy was good to MIC, it would be unlikely they were behind his
death, but on Lyndon Johnson and Texas oil interests arranging for the
assasination they would have been a tentative yes. They were happy
with the status quo, but after JFK with LBJ they would still get their
earnings. Historically we know LBJ escalated the war in Vietnam and
via MIC stocks he owned, made himself a billionaire in today's
dollars, the only president to do so while on the job. Overall things
worked out for the complex.

The launch of Sputnik unsettled the Eisenhower WH, and the
military-corporate interests immediately pushed for more spending, a
hoax was created, "US is falling behind", ergo the need for increased
military budgets. JFK exploited the issue too before his election, he
kept talking about a "missile gap" (btw US and USSR) but there was no
such gap, it was a lie.

Ledbetter: "Since the early 1950s, anyone who has expected American
military spending to shrink significantly in absolute terms has nearly
always been disappointed. Many commentators have concluded that
America‚Äôs military and political elite have exaggerated or even
manufactured threats to national security so as to maintain high
levels of military spending. While such theories can veer into
conspiracy, they were not unknown in the Eisenhower White House. At
any rate, the spending numbers speak for themselves. Robert Higgs has
calculated that in the period from 1948 to 1989, real military
spending in 2005 dollars came to an amount just shy of $13
trillion. The overall trend during this period was for military
spending to rise every year, a trend that holds true more or less
independently of any assessment of increased threats to national
security. Simply put, the fact of the United States being relatively
at peace has little impact on how much it spends on its military‚Äîwhich
strongly suggests that other forces are at work..

Military spending under Obama (taking into account not only the budget
line for the Defense Department but also interest on military-related
debt, spending on Iraq and Afghanistan, military spending from other
departments, and veterans‚Äô benefits) [was] more than a trillion
dollars a year"

---

Ledbetter, *Unwarrented Influence*: "The decades-long criticisms
demonstrate beyond doubt that..  excessive cost is built into the
Pentagon contracting process. In one classic case, a 1979 review of
major weapons systems by the General Accounting Office could not
locate a single instance since 1969 in which the Defense Department
had not underestimated its costs. In the 1990s, MIC critics began
focusing on 'add-ons' ‚Äî money that Congress approves for weapons
systems and construction projects even though the Pentagon has not
requested it. Perhaps the most notorious example is the C-130
transport plane, manufactured by Lockheed Martin. For decades,
Congress approved the purchase of new versions of this plane even
though no one from the executive branch had requested them. Over a
twenty-year period, only 5 such planes were commissioned by the Air
Force; Congress paid for 256"
