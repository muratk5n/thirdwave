<p>IC: "Despite New Western Recognition of Palestine, the Israeli Gov’t
is Coming for the West Bank..  I visited the West Bank three times
over the past 12 months, During the last visit, Israel announced its
intention to divide the West Bank into two parts and possibly three
according to its E1 plan. This is part of Israel bigger plan for the
West Bank including the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians and an
annexation to Israel.</p>
<p>In fact, ethnic cleansing and annexation are Israel only plans for the
West Bank since it occupied Gaza and the West Bank in 1967. All Israel
polices, including the engaging in a so-called peace process, are
aimed at achieving these Illegal targets."</p>

<p>The Grayzone: "Mike Cernovich, a conservative activist and longtime
ally of Kirk, may have been alluding to the break-up allegedly
initiated by Shillman when he tweeted on September 13, 2025, 'Charlie
was about to lose his last major donor because he refused to ban
Tucker Carlson from events. There are A LOT of people shedding
crocodile tears. The billionaires must be exposed for the cretins that
they are.' Along with the apparent rift between Shillman and Kirk, The
Grayzone has learned that Netanyahu’s US allies intensified their
campaign to manage the late TPUSA founder as his fateful first campus
tour date approached...</p>
<p>Netanyahu’s functionaries managed Kirk 'on an almost daily basis'..
Shillman’s apparent break with Kirk capped a months-long pressure
campaign from Zionist bigwigs, media operatives, and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu himself to bring the late conservative
activist back into line with the self-proclaimed Jewish state’s
agenda... [T]he TPUSA founder refused an offer by Netanyahu to arrange
a new infusion of funding into his organization from his stable of
Zionist millionaires and billionaires in the US."</p>

<p>That was good wording, contrasting 'never again' of the Jews with 'yet
again' of Palestinians getting bombed and killed.</p>
<p>King Abdullah (Jordan): “Our UN General Assembly was born 80 years
ago, pledging to learn from and not repeat history. The world vowed
'never again'.. However, for almost as long, Palestinians have been
living through a cruel cycle. Yet again, bombed indiscriminately, yet
again, killed, injured and maimed, yet again, displaced and
dispossessed, yet again denied rights, dignity, their basic
humanity.. So I must ask, how long?"</p>

<p>Pieter Hintjens: "[2014] For decades, the [bad boys] of the patent
system have been the pharmaceutical industry. The truth is that new
drugs, like new software, are never the product of single teams
working in shiny white laboratories. All innovation comes from mass
effort, over time, to solve numerous individual problems. it's not
just the formula for a drug. It's ten thousand answers to a thousand
problems, along the whole process. At some stage these come together
into viable products [..].</p>
<p>In 1980 the US passed the Bayh-Dole act [which] allowed universities
to keep the patents on federally-funded research. This is an
extraordinary model. The public pays for research that is then owned
by private business and sold back to the public at an extortionate
profit. Bayh-Dole was written and pushed by a consortium of
universities and big pharma. Lucky universities privatized every
significant part of the drug research pipeline, and sold these rights
off to their big pharma partners. The public saw new drugs for
HIV/AIDS, but at a thousand dollars a pop. Hey, that's what health
insurance is for, right?</p>
<p>But what was really happening was worse than a simple hijacking of
public research and blackmailing of the sick and vulnerable. The drug
pipeline stretches 15-20 years. It's a slow process of turning data
into knowledge. The process depends on collaboration between teams,
across the world. Patents poison this process. You cannot at the same
time collaborate on research, and file patents. Simply publishing or
discussing a new idea means you can't patent it [..] Successful
patenting demands secrecy, whereas successful innovation demands open
discussion. Ah, you see the conundrum [..].</p>
<p>The drug research pipeline is layered. That is, a product floats on a
sea of techniques and intermediate tools, and primary research, each a
necessary step on the way to the market. As Bayh-Dole bit, and
universities across the USA and then Europe and Asia started to cash
in, they patented more and more of these layers, until even basic
research techniques were patented as "products". Meaning that
researchers could no longer share techniques and basic knowledge [..].</p>
<p>The consequences were predictable. By the late 90's, the drug pipeline
was almost empty. Pfizer and Merck and the other big pharma brands saw
their profits falling off a cliff [..] Today Pfizer's share price has
fallen by 62% from its high in April 1999. The Bayh-Dole act has not
cured cancer. It has not helped the drug industry past that 20-year
pipeline window. The universities that jumped on that ship have lost
their best researchers. It hasn't produced a single new success in
medicine. Instead, it has allowed a few to profit from what was
already in the pipeline, and poisoned the well of US medical research
for at least three decades."</p>

<p>TAC: "Israel’s bombing of Qatar changed [the dynamics]. Qatar had an
American base; the U.S. couldn’t stop Qatar from being bombed by a
rabid American protectorate already mired in conflicts with five
neighbours, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, Yemen, and Gaza and the West
Bank... The fact that a U.S. base cannot provide deterrence
automatically pushed Turkey to seek rapprochement with Egypt and the
Saudis to seek Pakistani nuclear weapons. The Joint Strategic Defense
Agreement is interesting; it is a hint that the Pakistani strategic
forces will be used for any contingency and enhance joint
deterrence. It also automatically treats an attack on one to be an
attack on the other. Unlike NATO, it leaves no room for consultation
between the principals and leaves no ambiguity. In case there were any
comprehension issues, the subsequent Pakistani comments clarified that
the pact is a comprehensive agreement that encompasses all military
means."</p>
<hr />
<p>The American Conservative: "Reports that TikTok will transfer an 80
percent stake in its U.S. operations to Oracle, Silver Lake, and
Andreessen Horowitz are celebrated in Washington as a strategic
victory over China, where its parent company is based. But a closer
examination of the deal reveals a different winner: the foreign
government of Israel and its lobby in the United States...</p>
<p>[Remember back in November 2023] panic over TikTok’s 'pro-terror'
algorithm reached a crescendo after young people on the app discovered
Osama bin Laden’s 'Letter to America' through their 'For You'
page. For the first time, many Gen Zers read the Al Qaeda leader’s own
explanation for why the U.S. was attacked on 9/11—an explanation that
had nothing to do with hating 'our freedoms,' as official Washington
had long insisted, and everything to do with U.S. militarism abroad,
particularly on behalf of Israel... TikTok’s capacity to totally and
instantaneously shatter decades of neoconservative propaganda revealed
what Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, would
label Israel’s 'TikTok problem'..</p>
<p>The acquisition of TikTok by Oracle, Silver Lake, and Andreessen
Horowitz is therefore not simply a reshuffling of corporate control,
but the latest step to consolidate a foreign government’s censorship
regime in America. The app’s new owners openly display their affection
for, and often loyalty toward, Israel."</p>

<p>Neural nets (as in LLMs) are not the default solution in many AI
tasks.  They are clunky and don't perform well in all categories..
For computer vision background extraction, streaming video, SOTA is
still non neural-net based. Top two methods are probabilistic / use
non-parametric statistics, they use solid mathematics, not shoving
some data into a dumb-dumb black box... Before your clunky neural-net
can be written, deployed, maintained, my probabilistic model will
leave it in the dust.</p>

<p>A second pro shooter is likely, that means Kirk was killed by an
organized entity, for a specific purpose. What could that purpose be?
The most powerful entity is the military-industrial complex. Possible
reasons - trying to change the subject from something they feared
more, attempting to foment civil war knowing they would profit from
it, or Kirk's recent doubts about Zionism (no-no, wars in ME are a
major source of profits). Whatever their reasons, we need to be clear,
Kirk would not have been sacrificed if he was a loyal soldier of the
Zionist cause. His doubts, and the fact that he aired them so publicly
would have moved him up in the list, in that list of possible targets.</p>
<hr />
<p>They shifted the moment he nodded to the point where he was told his
alleged motive so he looked like he was accepting it which is
different from the local TV version. That means the modification was
made at the ABC. Small things like this matter.. a manipulation here,
a manipulation there.. this is how perception is controlled...</p>

<p>A Navy Seal sniper says the shot heard in the Kirk video sounds
muffled, not muffled as in silenced, muffled like the shot was made
from inside an apartment, possibly a few rooms behind an open window.</p>
<p>One spectator at the scene did say when he was watching Kirk speak,
facing him, he heard the shot from <em>his left</em>, not behind, (Robinson's
location). And after hit CK was thrown towards his left (sad scene to
watch, RIP) hinting the bullet coming from his right (spectator's
left).</p>
<p>The building marked in the pic could be the likely location for the
second (real) shooter. The guy was almost certainly a pro. For
Robinson, a 200 yard shot, with a "cold muzzle", added stress, wind
conditions, and that specific rifle would be next to impossible to
accomplish.  Plus there are other things abt the man that just don't
add up.</p>
