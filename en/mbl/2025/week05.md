# Week 5


Section 31 was not part of Roddenberry canon, it was added later,
during the Deep Space Nine era where the storylines also displayed
frequent usage of munee, capitalist Ferrengi were normalized, and
other weirdo shit was there... DS9 is the worst of the bunch IMO until
its record was beaten by ST Discovery.

There is no deep state in US today

The movie is about "Section 31" the deep state of the
Federation. Today's corporate power via their movies would rather have
you think about a futuristic deep state which evokes images of
bureucratic opression, this way you fear government structures
*today*, with that fear tell the gov not to tax the rich (anything gov
does is bad), and the current privatized dystopia, a fascistic
corporate control mechanisms continue. Thankfully the movie sucks so
it will likely create the opposite effect.

Critic: "The only thing Star Trek about this [movie] is some of the
names of the alien races, a few references here and there, and some
familiar sound effects. There's no boldly going anywhere here, there's
no interesting sci-fi concept, no highbrow ideas, no moral or ethical
dilemma, no intelligent plot, no exploration, no optimism, and no
hope. It's bland, bleak, dark, joyless, and dreadful"

One of those degenerate ones... Jar Jar Ibrahim / Kurtzman
type.  The reviews aren't good.

There is a new Trek movie?

Paper: "In this paper our aim is to show that an increase in wealth
inequality is associated with a slowdown in economic growth"

Sriskandarajah, LSE: "The rest is not just politics: how inequality is
trumping democracy.. In essence, the exponential accumulation of
wealth and power by the 'private few' reduces the capacity of the
'public many' to exercise the freedom to make the choices that shape
our lives. The promise that each of us in a democracy has an equal
vote and equal say in how our society functions then begins to ring
hollow.

Those earning less than a minimum wage are the least likely to be
civically engaged... inequality lowers an individualâ€™s sense of trust
in others: not in family or friends but in unspecified persons. Again,
this kind of generalised trust is a core component of social
capital. We tend to have less trust in people who are dissimilar to
us, which might explain the striking correlation observed in countries
like the US between an increase in income inequality and a sharp
decline in trust.

Central to neoliberalism is the push to shrink the size of the state â€“
to see little or no need for social security provisions or any other
transfers of resources from richer to poorer groups of
society. Neoliberals are steadfastly against such
'redistribution'. But a study by the non-partisan RAND Corporation
found an eye-watering level of redistribution in the US in the period
between 1975 and 2018 â€“ just not in the direction that progressives
were calling for. During this era in which Reagonomics and neoliberal
policies were let loose, the bottom 90 per cent of Americaâ€™s income
earners saw a hit to their combined incomes of $2.5 trillion each year
relative to the case where their incomes had grown in line with the
average(per capita) income trend for the country as a whole over this
period"

RR's acting took a dive after he became a bidnessman.. it's a
long-running sarcastic shtick now rather than anything of substance.

The wife is one of those "entrepreneurial" stars too apparently. When
these people are on screen you are not sure whether they are selling
products to make a movie, or making a movie to sell a product.

Guy felt up Ryan Reynold's wife, RR is jealous trying to cancel him? ðŸ¤£

It is supposed to be 1 person 1 vote. Thanks to inequality now it is
"1 dollar 1 vote".
