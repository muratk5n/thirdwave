# Week 1

NYT: "I Was a Health Insurance Executive. What I Saw Made Me
Quit... At Cigna, my P.R. team and I handled dozens of calls from
reporters wanting to know why the company refused to pay for a
patient’s care. We kept many of those stories out of the press..

One story that we couldn’t keep out of the press and that contributed
most to my decision to walk away from my career in 2008 involved
Nataline Sarkisyan, a 17-year-old leukemia patient in California whose
scheduled liver transplant was postponed at the last minute when Cigna
told her surgeons it wouldn’t pay. Cigna’s medical director, 2,500
miles away from Ms. Sarkisyan, said she was too sick for the
procedure. Her family stirred up so much media attention that Cigna
relented, but it was too late. She died a few hours after Cigna’s
change of heart.

Ms. Sarkisyan’s death affected me personally and deeply. As a father,
I couldn’t imagine the depth of despair her parents were facing. I
turned in my notice a few weeks later"

The tech doesn't work but there is so much money seeking investment
targets that the hype had to keep going.. That's why Balaji was
suicided. Moneyed interests are behind it. These bleeping bleepers are
worse than any opressive order anyone can imagine. It's like 1984 but
for moneyed class.

From a strategic pov more EU presence in Syria esp. now through TR
makes sense. Europe has a lot of intrests in Anatolia, vica
versa. After the Syrian refugee crisis interdependence increased, but
it is all a simple function of geography.

---

German FM made a visit to Syria. Syria will need lota cash to rebuild,
and I believe Europe just showed up at the door w promise of
truckloads, granted Syria is governed certain way. Good.. I hope the
EU is actively involved in building gov structures in Syria. That
would ease the reintegration of the country as well..

"As first-time homebuyers across the country face higher-than-ever
costs, California Rep. Ro Khanna is going after one of the biggest
winners of the housing crunch: Wall Street landlords. On Tuesday,
Khanna reintroduced the Stop Wall Street Landlords Act, a bill that
seeks to deter large institutional investors from scooping up
single-family homes...

In the first half of 2024, one in four 'low-priced' homes were
purchased by investors, according to the realty company Redfin. In
that same time, the percentage of Americans with a 'high degree of
concern' about housing costs rose to 69%, per data collected by the
Pew Research Center.

If passed, Khanna’s bill would increase taxes on future home
acquisitions made by companies and private equity funds that hold over
$100 million in assets and bar government-supported lenders from
backing new mortgages for such purchases. Khanna argued that
preventing large institutional investors from treating housing as a
speculative asset would ease an affordability crisis where demand for
housing has far outstripped supply"

78 Lex was silly. 2006 was too angry. Gunn is right the *Smallville*
version is definitely the best one. Can the new Lex top that?

For the 2006 Supes movie I remember B. Singer was going around saying
"Donner's vision! Donner's vision!", and the movie flopped, I dont
think he was able to capture Donner's vision, or if it would have
mattered if he did. The lighthearted tone Gunn is aiming for can work,
was that Donner's vision? Whatever. Let's hope it all works out.

Zachary Levy MD: "United Healthcare just denied a claim on one of my
patients in the ICU with:

- a brian hemorrhage
- in a coma
- on a ventilator
- in heart failure

.. because I haven't proven to them that caring for her in the
hospital was 'medically necessary'.

Tear it all down"

Private, corporate fascism (the latter word literally meaning
corporatism) is worse than any other opression.. That's why biz needs
to be kept in check, gov needs to carry a big stick, and sometimes
bash them on the head just to show them who the boss is. Hint: it's
the people through their representative government.

The Daily Economy: "[2022/09] Imagine if officials at your local bank
announced that they would start surveilling your public speech and
messages, and would deduct money from your account if they didn’t like
what you said. PayPal, the online payment services provider, unleashed
a furor last week after announcing just such a scheme...

In published amendments to its Acceptable Use Policy, the company
informed its customers, 'You may not use the PayPal service for
activities that ... involve the sending, posting, or publication of
any messages, content, or materials that, in PayPal’s sole discretion
…  promote misinformation.' PayPal claimed the right to seize $2500
from customers’ accounts for any purported violations.

PayPal’s.. former CEO David Marcus [responded:] 'PayPal’s
new.. [policy].. goes against everything I believe in. A private
company now gets to decide to take your money if you say something
they disagree with. Insanity'"

Molly White: "Not just one bad apple: FTX's practices were business as
usual in crypto.. Over a year after Sam Bankman-Fried’s trial, perhaps
one of the most memorable moments to stick with me was an unexpected
one: a brief exchange between prosecutors and BlockFi founder Zac
Prince.

>BlockFi's Zac Prince: [With] crypto firms, it was much less common to have audited balance sheets because of issues with getting audits as a cryptocurrency firm.
>
>Prosecutor: Just to be clear, some of the balance sheets you received from crypto firms were what is called unaudited balance sheets.
>
>Prince: I would say the majority of balance sheets that we received from cryptocurrency firms were unaudited.

This casual statement about lending hundreds of millions based on
scrawled estimates and a 'trust me, bro' underscored the deception in
crypto executives’ post-collapse claims that FTX was a rare bad actor
with aberrant business practices"

Royal Astronomical Society: "Dark energy 'doesn’t exist'.. The new
evidence supports the 'timescape' model of cosmic expansion, which
doesn't have a need for dark energy because the differences in
stretching light aren't the result of an accelerating Universe but
instead a consequence of how we calibrate time and distance...

Professor David Wiltshire, who led the study, said: 'Our findings show
that we do not need dark energy to explain why the Universe appears to
expand at an accelerating rate.. Dark energy is a misidentification of
variations in the kinetic energy of expansion, which is not uniform in
a Universe as lumpy as the one we actually live in.'

He added: 'The research provides compelling evidence that may resolve
some of the key questions around the quirks of our expanding
cosmos... With new data, the Universe's biggest mystery could be
settled by the end of the decade'" via @AntonPetrov

NYT: "[2015] The employees who kept the data systems humming in the
vast Walt Disney fantasy fief did not suspect trouble when they were
suddenly summoned to meetings with their boss... ome were performing
so well that they thought they had been called in for bonuses...
Instead, about 250 Disney employees were told in late October that
they would be laid off. Many of their jobs were transferred to
immigrants on temporary visas for highly skilled technical workers,
who were brought in by an outsourcing firm based in India. Over the
next three months, some Disney employees were required to train their
replacements to do the jobs they had lost.

'I just couldn’t believe they could fly people in to sit at our desks
and take over our jobs exactly,' said one former worker, an American
in his 40s who remains unemployed since his last day at Disney on
Jan. 30. 'It was so humiliating to train somebody else to take over
your job. I still can’t grasp it.'"

Captain America: Corporate Soldier.

The Nomad era in CA canon is when Cap was at odds with the goverment,
he was on the run following the "Sokovia Accords". Of course the
examplar, the shit, "America's Ass" would be against the government,
and this is the time period they will focus for that show. Corporate
subliminal messaging is telegramming the message "government is bad,
look at Cap, you should be like him (wink wink they also want to tax
us, so be against everything they do)". Pysop.

Andersen, *Evil Geniuses*: "And 1978 was also a tipping-point year in
the economic right’s crusade to persuade people that because
government now sucked, all taxes paid to all governments by everyone,
no matter how wealthy, were way too high and also sucked. The
overwhelmingly Democratic Congress overwhelmingly passed and the
Democratic president [Carter] signed into law a huge reduction in
taxes on income from selling stocks, capital gains—a definitive turn
toward making extra-sure the rich got richer faster..

During the 1980s, federal antitrust enforcement budgets and cases were
cut back to the levels of thirty and fifty years earlier. A true
libertarian OG who wanted to privatize Social Security, Greenspan
became Federal Reserve chairman in 1987 (and stayed in the job into
the new century). Democratic presidents now governed like liberal
Republicans, instructing Americans that 'all the legislation in the
world can’t fix what’s wrong with America' (Carter) and that 'the era
of big government is over' (Clinton)..

In 1977 President Carter declined to work hard for a bill that
would’ve given construction workers greater power to strike, and it
was defeated in the House, where Democrats had a two-to-one
majority. The next year the same Congress was considering a labor law
change that would’ve made it easier for all workers to unionize.  The
CEOs of fully unionized GM and GE were disinclined to oppose the bill,
but their fellow Business Roundtable member who ran the barely
unionized Sears persuaded them to lobby against it—and capitalist
solidarity carried the day. It too was defeated. Carter and most
Democrats shrugged"

---

Politico: "Jimmy Carter Wasn’t a Liberal.. These misconceptions seem
plausible today because Carter’s four-decade post-presidency was
notably more left-leaning than his presidency ever was. The
ex-president’s peace missions to North Korea and Cuba and his frequent
criticisms of U.S. policies regarding everything from the Palestinians
(whose treatment by Israel he famously likened to apartheid) to
domestic surveillance (“unprecedented violations of our rights to
privacy”) positioned Carter well to the left of Republican and
Democratic successors alike...

In truth, the pendulum started swinging to the [economic] right before
Carter took office, and continued doing so under Carter’s
presidency. Reagan didn’t change the pendulum’s direction; he just
accelerated its speed...

Carter, a former governor in the conservative Deep South, preferred to
point out that there was much government *couldn’t* do. 'There is a
limit to the role and the function of government,' Carter said in his
1978 State of the Union speech. 'Government cannot solve our
problems'"
