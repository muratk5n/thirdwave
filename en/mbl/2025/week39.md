A Navy Seal sniper says the shot heard in the Kirk video sounds
muffled, not muffled as in silenced, muffled like the shot was made
from inside an apartment, possibly a few rooms behind an open window.

One spectator at the scene did say when he was watching Kirk speak,
facing him, he heard the shot from *his left*, not behind, (Robinson's
location). And after hit CK was thrown towards his left (sad scene to
watch, RIP) hinting the bullet coming from his right (spectator's
left), the exit wound was on his left side, confirming the direction.

The building marked in the pic could be the likely location for the
second (real) shooter. The guy was almost certainly a pro. For
Robinson, a 200 yard shot, with a "cold muzzle", added stress, wind
conditions, and that specific rifle would be next to impossible to
accomplish.  Plus there are other things abt the man that just don't
add up.
