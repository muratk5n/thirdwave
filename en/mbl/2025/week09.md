# Week 9

CMB is likely a local phenomenon, not cosmological. The distribution
of galaxies cannot be explained properly, large scale structures
detected by JWST made sure of that. Bullet point \#3 is the biggest
fail, there should be 20 TIMES more lithium than predicted by the
theory, yet it isn't there. The general spirit of the article is
correct though, Lambda CDM is in trouble (along with much of modern
physics).

---

Explains so well? It fails at all those items listed. 

"One significant experimental anomaly that does not appear to be going
away, and which may point to a fundamental weakness in either the
standard model or Big Bang cosmology, is the discrepancy in values of
the Hubble constant based on different experimental approaches. This
discrepancy is now known as the Hubble tension...  While [everyone] is
hard at work scrutinizing their methods and refining their results,
researchers are increasingly considering the unsettling possibility
that one or more of the underlying physical theories are just plain
wrong, at least on the length and time scales involved.

Key among these theories is the Lambda-CDM model of Big Bang
cosmology. Yet physicists and cosmologists are loath to discard this
model, because it explains so much so well:

- The cosmic microwave background radiation and its properties.
- The large-scale structure and distribution of galaxies.
- The present-day observed abundances of the light elements (hydrogen,
  deuterium, helium and lithium).
- The accelerating expansion of the universe, as observed in
  measurements of distant galaxies and supernovas"

Masse: "Maxwell’s electromagnetic field equations for free space can
be derived from classical elasticity theory as applied to transverse
elastic waves propagating in a perfectly elastic aether"

---

Masse: "[Niels Bohr's] first postulated constraint is inconsistent
with classical mechanics, which permits any of a continuum of orbital
paths around the nucleus. The second constraint is inconsistent with
classical electromagnetism, which requires that accelerating electrons
radiate electro-magnetic energy that should be detectable... By
adopting these postulates, Bohr effectively assumed that neither
classical mechanics nor classical electromagnetism is applicable at
the scale of atomic dimensions..

The atomic model initially developed by chemists to explain the
formation and structure of molecules generally differed from the
atomic model developed by physicists primarily in one important
respect: the chemist’s atomic model was static..

From a theorem developed by Earnshaw (1842), we know that stable
equilibrium cannot be attained by a system of stationary point charges
interacting only according to Coulomb’s inverse-square force law...
Electrostatic equilibrium cannot exist by itself. Therefore, the force
keeping atomic electrons from falling into the nucleus cannot simply
be electromagnetic force. Moreover, since the atomic electrons are not
accelerating, the force keeping the atomic electrons from falling into
the nucleus cannot be centrifugal force. Only one possibility remains:
we must conclude that the force keeping the atomic electrons from
falling into the nucleus is the weak nuclear force...

The atom is static as proposed in early atomic models developed by
chemists.. Atoms are observed to possess a very great stability. This
stability can now be seen as the natural result of electron positions
in an atom generally corresponding to a minimum energy
configuration. Classical physics can explain both the stability and
structure of the atom"

Doctorow: "A January 2025 report from Groundwork Collective documents
how increasingly nurses in the USA are hired through gig apps — 'Uber
for nurses' — so nurses never know from one day to the next whether
they’re going to work, or how much they’ll get paid. There’s something
high-tech going on here with those nurses’ wages. These nursing apps —
a cartel of three companies, Shiftkey, Shiftmed and Carerev — can play
all kinds of games with labor pricing.

Before Shiftkey offers a nurse a shift, it purchases that worker’s
credit history from a data-broker. Specifically, it pays to find out
how much credit-card debt the nurse is carrying, and whether it is
overdue. The more desperate the nurse’s financial straits are, the
lower the wage on offer. Because the more desperate you are, the less
you’ll accept to come and do the gruntwork of caring for the sick, the
elderly, and the dying.

Now, there are lots of things going on here, and they’re all
terrible. What’s more, they are emblematic of 'enshittification,' the
word I coined to describe the decay of online platforms"

---

CDO's are still around BTW. The post-GFC reforms did not do away with
them.

---

I remember in a post-mortem analysis of GFC, there were reports on
those infamous CDO products. They were basically packaged mortgage
loans each loan with differing risk level, stacked on top of each
other, in order to "distribute risk". One book described a scene where
an operator brings up a CDO on the screen, each debtor was a little
dot you would see money flow and the red dots for people who missed a
payment (who would later lose their houses, get foreclosed on, the
creditor ended up with the house which I'm sure they were fine with).
So via a CDO you could buy the debt of 100 people, in one package.
Financial services made that easy for you, if you had the money.

Stevenson: "In the UK, ordinary people tend to hold their assets in
property, and there is and there will be less direct owning of
property by ordinary families.  But what you will see increasingly is
the government need to keep people owning property politically.  The
rich have this enormous amount of cash, which is driving house prices
up.  The way that the government can square that circle is to
encourage rich people to lend that money.  And that money gets
borrowed eventually by ordinary people.  And I think this gets
disguised somewhat by the fact that this lending tends to go through
the banking system... a lot of people [likely] assume that when
mortgages go up, what that means is the bank is accumulating credit...
[But.. ]  banks are essentially middlemen.  They borrow money from the
rich, they lend money to mortgages, and the mortgage interest goes
from you, the mortgager, to the bank to the rich.  These people are
essentially just middlemen in between.

So you need to understand this, because governments will see the only
way to keep ordinary people in houses is to encourage high levels of
lending, high levels of mortgages, to do things like reduce the checks
on mortgage eligibility, to encourage things like longer term
mortgages, to encourage things like multi-generational mortgages.  And
this is exactly the transfer of wealth from the middle class to the
rich.  You are getting further and further into debt.  The rich are
getting further and further into credit.  They are owning your house
via your mortgage and they are driving you into poverty"

Gary Stevenson: "When you live in a very wealth unequal society.. that
means is a small group of people own all of the companies, they own
all of the commercial property, they own most of the properties. And
ordinary people are continually having to pay them rents, profits and
interest. If inequality gets very large, these flows of cash from
ordinary families to the rich become very large.  [Then three things
happen] One is ordinary people work much more for the rich, although
in reality, if you try and do that, it tends to just push wages down.
Two is ordinary families sell their assets to the rich, and that is
why we are seeing reduced homeownership rates and reduced ability to
save in pensions.  But the third one is the rich can lend that money
back to the poor. And that is what we're seeing when we see mortgage
sizes increase.  What you are seeing there is the rich taking enormous
amounts of money from working families and then lending it back...

During Covid, governments gave out an enormous amount of money. And
that money was largely, in the end, accumulated by richer people...
When these rich people started to accumulate cash, what do they do?..
They tend to want to own a balanced portfolio..  They want to own
things like stocks and shares..  They want to own property as well..
But the problem with property is it's very difficult for super rich
people to buy enormous amounts of property...  So what do rich people
do?..  If I had £500,000 cash and I wanted to buy a property, I could
go out and spend £500,000, buy a flat in London.  £500,000 is kind of
roughly what a flat in London costs nowadays.  I could rent it to my
sister and she could pay me rent every month.  Alternatively, I could
lend that money to my sister.  She could go out and buy the house
herself, and then she could pay me interest every month.  How are
these two things different to me?

Well, the first thing I want to point out is, what is the difference
between those two examples on the housing market and on house prices?
The answer is that is exactly no difference.  You know the housing
market doesn't see whether it's me or whether it's my sister, whether
I'm buying directly or whether I'm lending to my sister.  All the
housing market sees is somebody’s coming in with £500,000 and buying a
house.

So what that shows you is whether I buy the house directly or whether
I lend the money out to buy the house.  In both cases, I drive the
house price up.  The second thing is this question of who actually
owns the house.  So legally, technically, if I lent the money to my
sister, my sister owns the house.  But what is her net worth after she
buys it?  Well, she buys a flat that's worth £500,000.  She has debt
of £500,000.  She's worth nothing.  So, essentially, I own the equity
in the house..

Mortgage lending and the accumulation of credit by the rich is the way
in which rich people buy houses.  And if you are sitting on a house
with an enormous mortgage, realistically you don't own that house.
The person who lent you the money owns that house.  And it's important
to understand this because as we go forward, this increased size of
mortgage is going to be the primary way in which we see the wealth of
the middle class decline"

America oscillates between two extremes, either too industrious

stupidest theories presented as real physics many worlds, multiverses,
string theory among others. There doesn't seem to be a middle point
between the two extremes, as in conceptually sound and wide-reaching
base formulations that will explain experimental results. Eurasia

Masse: *Nature of Physical Fields and Forces*: "Newton’s force law can
be used to derive Poisson’s gravitational field equation. Moreover,
since Newton’s force law of gravity is not a function of time,
Poisson’s field equation of gravity only applies to gravitational
fields that are stationary. Therefore, Poisson’s field equation of
gravity and Newton’s force law of gravity must be mathematically
equivalent for a stationary gravitational field... The physical
interpretation of Poisson’s field equation of gravity is, however,
very different from the physical interpretation of Newton’s force law
of gravity. Rather than the action-at-a-distance interpretation of
gravity obtained from Newton’s force law of gravity, Poisson’s field
equation is based upon and must be interpreted in terms of the
existence of a physical medium consisting of contiguous particles
about any material body [aether!]"

Having a proper imperial past that descends from a militocracy would
help to get the right context on Ukraine, Georgia, Syria.. Empires
care about their borders, "what I control" vs "what the other guy
controls". You worry abt "trouble at the far flung edges" they can
spread and reach the middle. When I read my history I see statements
like "words of unrest reached [from a distant outpost] Sublime Porte
(the Otto palace), and they mobilized in a hurry". It is that "oh
shit" moment that many do not get. We are alert, borders have been
fought over for centuries, shed blood over.. This is not some
"McDonalds franchise" where you worry about "market share" and all you
care about is parachuting into some country beyond the border to open
a store there, and start selling products. The border is
life-or-death.

How did I find about Richard Masse's work? I was looking for a way to
explain how to derive the Lagrangian form of least action, the famous
$T - V$ formula from basic principles. I saw a derivation starting
from $\int mvds$, Euler's method, they call mass times velocity times
distance as "action", based on Maupertuis. But neither method sound
fundamental.  Feynman does a great job motivating $T - V$ in his
lectures (Vol II), he articulates extremely well why he thinks the
method works, but he is essentially putting lipstick on a pig. He is
rationalizing, the choice of this particular formula is arbitrary. It
is pulled out of the air, in a "let's see if this works" kind of
experiementation (obviously it did), explained later.

Then I searched for books on the subject, Masse's came up.  His
approach was Newton's second law is more fundamental, derive
Lagrangian from there, but still, not fundamental enough. This is
where his eather formulation comes in, he can derive the second law
from it.

There’s a deep historical irony in these recent developments: During
the Third Reich, it was the Max Planck Society then known as the
Kaiser Wilhelm Society that lost its best and brightest to the
U.S. and other countries"

The Guardian: "[2021] Literally meaning 'alternative-less',
*alternativlos* was Angela Merkel’s own version of a line usually
associated with Margaret Thatcher: 'There is no alternative.' But if
'TINA' was specifically used to close down debates over alternatives
to the market economy, Merkel’s government declared all type of policy
decisions *alternativlos*.. [eg open border immigration policy]. Her
use of the phrase also inspired the naming of the first party to the
right of her CDU to make it into the Bundestag: Alternative für
Deutschland [AfD]"

Sounds like a good plan so far

The New Arab: "Egypt’s diplomatic plan for Gaza's future is set to be
presented to US President Donald Trump after receiving approval at key
upcoming summits in Riyadh and Cairo... According to a high-ranking
Egyptian diplomat based in Washington, the initiative from Cairo
is divided into two phases, which are estimated to cost tens of
billions of dollars.

The first phase spans ten years and primarily focuses on rebuilding
Gaza's infrastructure, housing, and residential sectors. The plan
includes the redistribution of population clusters in Gaza,
particularly by easing the density of the population in northern Gaza
and creating less populated zones near illegal Israeli settlements.

The second phase, still open for Arab discussion and refinement, would
start the process of establishing a Palestinian state, focusing on
creating links between Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem...

Another key element of the first phase is the regulation of
weapons. Cairo's approach seeks to address concerns from international
donors financing Gaza's reconstruction while respecting Palestinian
armed groups' demands of retaining their arms until a Palestinian
state is established...

Another crucial aspect of this stage involves the establishment of an
Arab-led committee, with Egypt at the helm, tasked with resolving
disputes between local security forces and militant factions"

Masse: "Having concluded that time in our Universe is a result of the
flow of aether into matter, we see that time cannot be modified in any
way (shortened or lengthened). Time is then uniform and absolute
throughout our Universe and is independent of the kinematic properties
and spatial position of any observer. Since absolute motion
(acceleration) exists in our Universe, it is to be expected that
absolute time must also exist.  Time is not relative, and time does to
alter with the motion of any reference system.

We see, therefore, that Einstein’s special theory of relativity, with
its kinematically dependent time, cannot be correct. We also see that,
while Newton was correct in postulating the existence of absolute
time, he was incorrect in assuming that such time is independent of
anything external.  Aether provides not only the absolute frame of
reference in our Universe, but also (together with matter) the
absolute time in our Universe. Time is not, then, a fundamental entity
of our Universe"

We need boring scifi. A new show can focus on truly unknown, but
knowable stuff.. One episode they can discover how gravity
works. Another fixes quantum mechanics. Forget abt these multiple
universes, time travel. Try to imagine how stuff works in one universe
with boring time (it only flows forward).
