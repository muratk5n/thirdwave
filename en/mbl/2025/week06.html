<p>When user views the frontline maps for Ukraine on this blog, they are
running Javascript code locally, on their machine... I send Javascript
code to your browser to run, that code in turn fetches two more data
files from my blog (before/after coordinates for the frontline, two
simple text files), and displays them. Another piece of code, Leaflet,
also runs on browser allows the underlying mapping to be displayed w/
dynamic zooming. It all takes place locally to the user, their CPU
does the work, almost nothing happens on the server.</p>
<hr />
<p>Javascript (code that can run in the browser) is the universal GUI
now. If I was starting any UI-heavy project I would not bother with
anything else. JS is deployable anywhere (bcz browsers run all
platforms), and now with the addition of WebAssembly it can
incorporate code from multiple languages.</p>

degrees and a lot of them went into medicine and dentistry. They
became doctors and dentists. And now the doctors and dentists who make

things like Botox or like teeth whitening, teeth straightening,
cosmetic stuff that is obviously not like medically essential. Or they
work for private healthcare, healthcare for rich people... [Some say]
"That's politics of envy".  Well, what happens when you need a
dentist?  What happens when your kids need a dentist?  And we're in a
situation now in this country where it's becoming increasingly
impossible to get a NHS dentists to get cheaper, affordable dental
care.  And as a result, people are just not going to the dentist. And
it's not that the dentists are not there... just like your kids are in

<p>Hossein-Zadeh, <em>The Political Economy of US Militarism</em>: "[2006]
Official explanations such as weapons of mass destruction, Saddam’s
threat to the United States, or his connection to Al-Qaida, can now
easily be dispensed with as flimsy, harebrained pretexts for the
invasion of Iraq. Critics have, instead, pointed to a number of other
factors behind the drive to war. Those factors are divided into two
categories in this chapter: secondary or minor factors and primary or
major ones. Included among secondary reasons for the war are the role
of domestic politics, the influence of the so-called neoconservative
ideologues, and the role of oil. Primary or major factors include the
military-industrial complex and the militant Zionist proponents of
“greater Israel.” I will call the unofficial, unspoken, de facto
alliance between these two major forces, precipitated by a convergence
of their respective interests on war and political convulsion in the
Middle East, the military-industrial-Likud alliance.</p>

<p>Capitalism has many blind spots. Private capital turns everyone into a
wage slave, but it needs major government help to do it.  If education
(basically daycare) isn't public, then there is no place where kids
can be dropped off while parents are at work. That means an unhappy
wage slave. They could revolt!</p>

<p>Of course all WebAssembly tools are free and open source. In my crowd,
line of work (which is where all the action is -not to boast-) it is
mostly FOSS. We don't even think about it, so I sometimes forget to
comment on these things, but outside observers need to know, see the
power dynamic here. It's all about open source. We are the shit, the
rest are losers. I haven't bought a commercial software for decades
now. I use FOSS, I contribute to FOSS.. A client, company I work for
can utilize software "on the cloud" serving software for money but the
underlying software better f-ing be FOSS, otherwise I won't touch it.</p>

<p>During debt crises era 2010s there were a lot of government-spending-of-any-kind-fixes-all
economists running around in the media. "If there is no spending,
someone has to, government has to step up and spend, create aggregate
demand". Well government did spend during covid, gave people bunch of
money, inequality still increased. Where is aggregate demand?  If the
flow of money is one-directional, and it all ends up in assets not
owned by the middle class, you are still screwed. Gov spends, will
fall further in debt, the rich will buy that debt along w/ other
assets, collect interest and become richer. The cycle will continue..</p>

<p>Halton Arp: "[One galaxy I cataloged] has a large companion on the end
of a luminous arm. In 1971 a spectrum revealed that this companion was
8,000 km/sec higher redshift than the central, active Seyfert
galaxy. This amount of excess redshift cannot be accomodated in the
conventional picture where redshifts mean velocities in an expanding
universe. They could not be at such different distances and be
physically interacting. When Fred Hoyle heard about this he came up
from the Cal Tech campus to my Carnegie office and asked to see the
original picture. In 1972 he gave the prestigious Russell Lecture at
the Seattle meeting of the American Astronomical Society and outlined
a theory whereby younger galaxies radiated intrinsically redshifted
photons. His theory of growing particle masses was a more general
solution to the conventional field equations but was physically a
Machian (not Einsteinian theory). At the end of the lecture he said
the NGC 7603 observation created a crisis in physics and we needed to
cross over the bridge to a radically more general physics...</p>
<p>Over the years the evidence for non-velocity redshifts has grown
enormously, both for quasars and galaxies. A number of researchers
have tried to make the establishment admit the consequences of this
evidence. But it has been suppressed and ignored. However, In an event
of great irony, 30 years after Hoyle's talk featuring NGC 7603, two
young Spanish astronomers have announced the finding of two
quasar-like, much higher redshift objects imbedded in the arm which
connects the low redshift galaxy to the higher redshift companion of
NGC 7603. As in many past cases, this result alone should have settled
instantly and finally the existance of intrinsic redshifts. Instead
the paper was turned down by 'Nature' Magazine, rejected by the
'Astrophysical Journal' and only finally accepted by the European
Journal 'Astronomy and Astrophysics'...</p>
<p>The ejection in opposite directions of material from active galaxies,
including very high redshift material like quasars, has been building
up now for over 37 years. Yet the radio map shown here and the
notation that his object had 'two redshifts', one a 'background
object', lay unoticed and unchallenged in the voluminous literature
for 4 years! When it was finally submitted to the Astronomical Society
of the Pacific it was rejected. In spite of my being a past President
of this organization they refused other observational results and
communications and I had to resign. It is particularly vexing that the
A.S.P. has as a primary goal educating the public about astronomy. But
since it was hijacked by fanatical Big Bang adherents, it has been
exactly misinforming the public"</p>

<p>Fleming: "Einstein was stuck, in that by denying the existence of
aether, or any other medium of transmission of light, he still wanted
to explain clock rate slowing and hypothetical distance
contraction. In order to do that, he imagined that space itself must
change its spatial and time dimensions when that space is moving
relative to other space. His space was not a wallless container but
was physical. In order to do away with aether theory, he had to treat
space like it had physical properties, including spatial and time
dimensions that were variable. Therein lies Einstein’s fallacy. He
claimed space is non-physical and physical at the same time...</p>
<p>We now know experimentally that all space contains vacuum energy
consistent with Max Planck’s theory of quantum oscillators. Per his
theory it is impossible for space to be empty. Planck oscillators are
something physical that we can use to explain all the known physical
properties of space. Quantum vacuum energy has wavelengths and
frequencies that give space its spatial and time dimensionality. The
quantum vacuum also gives us a standard reference frame to use when
making relativistic frame transformations, as well as giving us a
physical medium for light and force transmission...</p>
<p>Einstein had not actually solved the problem. He merely turned space
into a new form of aether while still failing to provide a physical
explanation for its physical properties"</p>

feel obligated to like.</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Oppenheimer</em> was boring. Except a few conversations between Murphy
and Damon, there was no life in it. Is this how C. Nolan plans to
cement his position as a grand director? Make stuff boring, package
obfuscation as smart (Tenet), and/or rely on extended dramatic music
sequences that ramble on the same high exceeding its welcome but
somehow comes across as a refined movie technique (Inception). It
won't work. Except a few fools in the Academy his position in movie
history is far from cemented. He is on shaky ground.</p>

<p>Zelensky can demand all RU occupied regions back until he is blue in
the face. He has no capability to achieve that. It's like, while the
Red Army rolling into Berlin Hitler says "I demand to take
Moscow". Just because he says that, should a peace agreement be the
middle point between his demand and Russia's, and the Red Army pulls
back to middle point between Moscow and Berlin? This is non-sense.</p>
<hr />
<p>Negotiations are about finding middle point of what both sides are
<em>capable</em> to do, not what they <em>say</em> they want to do. Russia is
capable to prolong the war, take eastern Ukraine, take Odesa, and nuke
Ukraine. Ukraine is able to put up some defense, delay Russia, play
spoiler in some areas. The middle of both these capabilities is giving
Russia the four regions it wants plus Crimea, and keep Ukraine out of
NATO. Simple.</p>
