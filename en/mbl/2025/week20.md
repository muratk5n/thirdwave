NYT: "In Private, Some Israeli Officers Admit That Gaza Is on the
Brink of Starvation"

These LLMs are somewhat anal, they can be pedantic, unimaginative.
They remind me of shitlibs, you know the type, office-dwelling
blue-no-matter-who, faux-left, redundant, coastal Democrats. They take
their knowledge purely textually, they ingest, blurt it out somewhat
creatively but don't truly understand. LLMs epitomize what these
people consider as a smart person.

I don't think *oobats* is an Italian word

He is at least of Italian descent, part paisan.. of course, you have
to know your prujoot, gabagool, must be a precondition for the job.

*L'Americano*.. It would be funny if he had a really high-pitched
accent, like Ned Flanders, or Ross Perot.

Patriotic Millionaires: "Think of someone who starts a small business
— with a modest investment of, say $100,000 — that over three decades
grows into a not-so-small business worth 25 million. Our culture
celebrates small-business success stories like that, and political
leaders in both parties seek to protect the owners of these businesses
at tax time. Why punish, these lawmakers ask, small business people
who started from humble beginnings and sacrificed weekends and
vacations to build up their enterprises?

But do we get sound policy when we base our tax rates on high incomes
on the assumption that certain high-earners have sacrificed nobly for
their earnings?  Think of a highly specialized surgeon who made huge
personal sacrifices to develop the skills she now uses to save the
lives of her patients. Should the annual income tax rate she pays on
her wages be ten times the effective annual income tax rate on the
gain that the founder of a telephone solicitation call center realizes
when he sells the business after 30 years?

Just as magicians get their audiences to focus on the left hand and
pay no attention to the right, defenders of the lax tax treatment of
investment gains heartily hail the hard work of farmers and small
business owners, a neat move that diverts our attention from what
simply can be windfall investment gains.

Those.. business owners, you see, provide political cover for
America’s billionaires, by far the biggest beneficiaries of the
regressive taxation of capital gains"

---

Patriotic Millionaires: "[W]e tax the ultra-rich on their investment
gains less, not more. The rates we see on paper only apply to gains
taxpayers register in the year they sell their investments. But we get
a totally different story when we calculate the effective annual tax
rate for long-held investments...

For members of America’s top echelon — the wealthiest 2 percent or so
of American households — the effective annual tax rate on capital
gains income, the rate that really matters in measuring the impact a
tax has on wealth accumulation, actually rates as sharply regressive...

Consider Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. His original investment in
Amazon over 30 years ago, in the neighborhood of $250,000, has now
grown close to 200 billion dollars. And that’s after he’s sold off
billions of dollars worth of shares. Or how about Warren Buffett,
whose original investment in Berkshire Hathaway, the source of
virtually all his wealth, dates back to 1962?

Bezos and Buffett, when they sell shares of their stock, face
effective annual rates of tax similar to those in that far right bar
of the graphic above, under 4 percent"

ProPublica: "For decades, I’ve reported on outrageous health care
costs in the U.S. and the burden they place on patients. I’ve revealed
the tactics used by drug companies to drive sales and keep the price
of their products high. Even with my experience, the cost of Revlimid
stood out. When I started taking the drug, I’d look at the smooth,
cylindrical capsule in my hand and consider the fact I was about to
swallow something that costs about the same as a new iPhone...

I wanted to know how this drug came to cost so much — and why the
price keeps going up. The price of Revlimid has been hiked 26 times
since it launched. Some of what happened was reported at the time. But
no one has pieced together the full account of what the drugmaker
Celgene did, how federal regulators failed to rein it in and what the
story reveals about unrestrained drug pricing in America.

What I discovered astonished even me...

When Celgene launched Revlimid in December of 2005, it set the initial
price at $55,000 a year, or 218 a pill, which was about double what
analysts expected.. Seven months later, when the FDA approved the drug
for multiple myeloma, the price jumped to 70,560 dollar a year, or 280
a pill...

Celgene worked to mute any criticism of Revlimid.

In 2005, Celgene received reports that Los Angeles oncologist
Dr. James Berenson was “bashing” Revlimid in presentations sponsored
by patient groups. In one email, a senior company official said, 'it
is time for us to take Jimbo to the wood shed.' The company discussed
a range of options for dealing with the doctor, from taking legal
action to arranging a sit-down with Celgene’s chief executive.

Ultimately, the company appears to have decided on a friendlier course
of action. Berenson became a frequent paid speaker and consultant for
the company, with payments totaling at least 333,000, according to
Celgene disclosures. Berenson declined to comment. He wasn’t the only
doctor the company befriended. Payment records show that between 2013
and 2018, Celgene paid doctors $11 million for speaking engagements
and consulting work related to Revlimid...

Celgene went on to spread its largesse across the multiple myeloma
world. It funded patient groups, sponsored medical meetings and
contracted with prestigious academic medical centers. 'They remind me
of an octopus with many, many tentacles, and at the end of each
tentacle is a wad of cash,' said David Mitchell, a former Washington,
D.C., communications executive who launched a nonprofit organization
to fight for lower prices after he was diagnosed with multiple
myeloma. 'Everybody relies on the money'"

Iraqi Kurds had Kirkuk but Iraq took it from them.. The ultimate test
of statehood in ME is the ability to beat on the Kurds. Hopefully
there will be no need for that kind of beating anymore.

---

It looks like they do connect together, a contiguous piece of
land. Will they declare statehood at some point?

---

All Kurdish regions.. 

```python
import json
dk = json.loads(open("kurds.json").read())
u.map_coords({"Raqqa": [35.9588353, 39.0070503]},lines=dk,zoom=6,outfile='map08.html')

There was a cross-nation Kurdish pow-wow recently.

You can "mount" the image of a disc as if it is an hardware disc into
your filesystem. Can Windoze do that? I mean out-the-box, not after
installing some shit .exe full of spyware, bloatware and backdoors
into your machine. 

---

Mfka... `sudo mount -o loop disc_img.iso /mnt/iso`.. yeaaah now I got
the disc contents.. Still what a pain in the ass.

---

Then shares the disc image iso file on a Web site...

Pakis chose well.. Their military supplier China is a relatively new
player in the game, they could not have been sure, but bet on an
entire suite of solutions, an integrated air force system, from
early-warning down to missiles shot by their jet fighters. They were
right.

---

Clearly the shit does not self-control, self-police, or work for the
betterment of humanity left unchecked.

Corollary, if we intervene in the markets to correct monopoly, why not
intervene for other things, other sectors as well? Healthcare,
transit, energy? I mean the entire ideology, "way of life",
economic-ing collapsed already.. What's left?

---

If unfettered markets were optimal, why do we need fucking anti-trust?

Nigel Farage: "Just days after Reform’s catastrophic defeat of Labour
in its heartlands such as Durham and Doncaster, the Prime Minister has
made his latest fatal error... His new trade deal with India has sold
out British workers to the highest degree. Indians who are transferred
to work in Britain by their employers will receive an exemption to
National Insurance for at least three years"

TR fighter jet Kaan is not 5th gen. You could call it 4.5 with some
stealth capabilities. Reports on its radar range vary. How is its
AWACS integration?

That makes sense...

If China opens the floodgates though and turn the conflict into a
proyx war and a major testing ground for their military tech, could
that change the dynamic?

In an all-out war IN wld do better..
