Actually I was unfair, LLMs are not as smart as an hamster.. An
hamster is still smarter than these "AI" algorithms. I meant LLM
*processing power* is similar to an hamster. But since their
algorithms are shit, inefficient, the result is colorful, sometimes
creative, parroty junk. It can sound smart, but boy, when it takes a
wrong turn, it all goes down the cliff.. A hamster is absolutely
smarter than any neural network based approach currently in use.

course. But there are people who make *more* money than her, strangely
enough.

Amid America's \#COVID19 disaster, I must come clean about a lie I

idea that Canada's single-payer system was awful & the U.S. system
much better. It was a lie"
