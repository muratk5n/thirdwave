<p>Wiki: "The Guatemalan Revolution began in 1944, after a popular
uprising toppled the military dictatorship of Jorge Ubico. Juan José
Arévalo was elected president in Guatemala's first democratic
election. He introduced a minimum wage and near-universal
suffrage. Arévalo was succeeded in 1951 by Árbenz, who instituted land
reforms which granted property to landless peasants...</p>
<p>The U.S. government feared that Guatemala's example could inspire
nationalists wanting social reform throughout Latin America. The
United Fruit Company (UFC), whose highly profitable business had been
affected by the softening of exploitative labor practices in
Guatemala, engaged in an influential lobbying campaign to persuade the
U.S. to overthrow the Guatemalan government. U.S. President Harry
Truman authorized Operation PBFortune to topple Árbenz in 1952"</p>

<p>Power Magazine: "BASF has commissioned that country’s largest proton
exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer.  The company said the 54-MW
facility will have an annual capacity of as much as 8,000 metric tons
of hydrogen. The electrolyzer is located at BASF’s Ludwigshafen
site. It is designed to produce zero-carbon hydrogen, using
electricity from renewable energy resources, with capacity to supply
the main plant at the site with up to one metric ton of chemical
feedstock each hour"</p>

<hr />
<p>The TR opposition likely realized they made a mistake in the earlier
prez election. There were a lot of chefs in the kitchen then, settling
on a presidential candidate took a while, though many favored Istanbul
mayor Ekrem Imamoglu the decision wasn't clear cut. So when lawfare
was unleashed on him, just like today, the mayor was one of the many
candidates, the opposition sort of moved on to other candidates and
ultimately chose a lame guy (and lost).</p>
<p>Now oppo realized its mistake, they chose Imamoglu early, likely
expecting an undemocratic lawfare attack again, but when it arrived
this time they circled the wagons around him, making the fight about
EI and indirectly about democracy. If they insist on sticking with the
mayor they will be performing a boycott of sorts.</p>

<p>Politico: "Waltz at another point claimed he had never met Goldberg,
hours before a reporter unearthed a picture on social media of the two

Embassy."</p>
<hr />
<p>Sometimes even potus can direct you to leak.. Party affiliation does
not match sure but some stuff might spin better if it comes from a Dem
dickbag like Goldberg.</p>
<hr />
<p>Waltz could have added Goldberg to contact his list preparing to leak
to him later. Journos get those tidbits "from an unnamed official in
the administration" all the time don't they?. But then Waltz was
confused that day while creating the group, invited Goldberg by
mistake thinking he was someone else. It is possible.</p>
<hr />
<p>Good timing for them.. DJT's Canada attacks helped libs there, before

<p>Foreign Policy: "On Tuesday, March 18, the German parliament ended the
country’s economic Sonderweg, or 'unique path.' On that day,
two-thirds of members voted for a far-reaching change of the fiscal
constitution. Technically, the debt brake—Germany’s constitutionally
codified fiscal rule—is still in place. But from now on, defense
expenditures exceeding 1 percent of GDP will be exempted from the
deficit ceiling; infrastructure and climate related expenditures can
be financed from a special fund, which is also exempted from the debt
brake; and states also get additional fiscal space"</p>

<p>CDOs are financial instruments that pooled multiple debt obligations
(cash streams) whereby an investor (the rich) could offer loan money
by simply purchasing the CDO and collect interest on that loan... But
due to inequality massive amount of wealthy people's money rushed into
these instruments, raising the price of the underlying asset, housing
in this case, for regular people. Regulating the markets are a good
fix of course (regulation is always good), but the better fix is
reducing the wealth of the ultra-rich so their excessive money does
not cause price bubbles in products the middle class needs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Paper: "Explaining the U.S. Housing Bubble: are CDOs to Blame?..I
argue that a credit supply [increase].. originating in the CDO market
in 2004, was a significant causal factor in the unsustainability of
the credit driven housing boom of the early 2000’s. This paper sheds
light on when credit booms become bubbles and why... My results
suggest that the credit fueled housing price growth prior to 2004 may
have been the result of sustainable innovations in meeting the needs
of credit constrained borrowers. I argue that the CDO market was the
critical link along the credit chain both in terms of its
unsustainability as well as the causal role it played in effecting
home price appreciation"</p>

<p>Fools think by elevating meritocracy to new heights, they are helping
general populace. But talent on specific topics, at the level that can
earn serious money appears only in a few, so if we tie wealth
accumulation to that, we are not broadening its reach. We might as
well ask people to dig for gold, or give only red haired, or
left-handed people a lot of money.</p>

<p>The Guardian: "The mainstream of the Democratic party has long accused
progressives.. of a kind of moral vanity, a willingness to sacrifice
effective governance or policy gains for the sake of personal
purity. The shoe is now on the other foot: it is the mainstream
Democratic leadership – Schumer and his allies – who now favor decorum
over the public interest, personal dignity over principle, a vain hope
for a return to the politics of the past over their responsibility to
engage with the realities of the present. It is the centrist
Democrats, not the progressives, who are living in a delusion, and who
are selling out the country in order to maintain it"</p>
