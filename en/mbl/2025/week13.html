<p>CDOs are financial instruments that pooled multiple debt obligations
(cash streams) whereby an investor (the rich) could offer loan money
by simply purchasing the CDO and collect interest on that loan... But
due to inequality massive amount of wealthy people's money rushed into
these instruments, raising the price of the underlying asset, housing
in this case, for regular people. Regulating the markets are a good
fix of course (regulation is always good), but the better fix is
reducing the wealth of the ultra-rich so their excessive money does
not cause price bubbles in products the middle class needs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Paper: "Explaining the U.S. Housing Bubble: are CDOs to Blame?..I
argue that a credit supply [increase].. originating in the CDO market
in 2004, was a significant causal factor in the unsustainability of
the credit driven housing boom of the early 2000’s. This paper sheds
light on when credit booms become bubbles and why... My results
suggest that the credit fueled housing price growth prior to 2004 may
have been the result of sustainable innovations in meeting the needs
of credit constrained borrowers. I argue that the CDO market was the
critical link along the credit chain both in terms of its
unsustainability as well as the causal role it played in effecting
home price appreciation"</p>

hydrogen facility.. The new hydrogen industry will create good jobs
and environmental sustainability, says Minister of Natural Resources..
The federal government is pitching a wad of cash to help build a new
hydrogen facility on the North Shore waterfront, with the eventual
goal of filling fleets of heavy duty trucks with the alternative

<p>Fools think by elevating meritocracy to new heights, they are helping
general populace. But talent on specific topics, at the level that can
earn serious money appears only in a few, so if we tie wealth
accumulation to that, we are not broadening its reach. We might as
well ask people to dig for gold, or give only red haired, or
left-handed people a lot of money.</p>

<p>The Guardian: "The mainstream of the Democratic party has long accused
progressives.. of a kind of moral vanity, a willingness to sacrifice
effective governance or policy gains for the sake of personal
purity. The shoe is now on the other foot: it is the mainstream
Democratic leadership – Schumer and his allies – who now favor decorum
over the public interest, personal dignity over principle, a vain hope
for a return to the politics of the past over their responsibility to
engage with the realities of the present. It is the centrist
Democrats, not the progressives, who are living in a delusion, and who
are selling out the country in order to maintain it"</p>
<hr />
<p>Politico: "We Dug Into the Polls. Democrats in Congress Should Be Very
Afraid...  The Democratic base’s disillusionment runs so deep that
it’s eerily reminiscent of Republican grassroots sentiment in the
period leading up to Donald Trump’s takeover of the Republican
Party.. The numbers are clear: No longer satisfied with the status quo
in their party, Democrats are on the verge of a Tea Party-style,
intra-party revolt"</p>
