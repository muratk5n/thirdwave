<p>NYT: "Israel’s leaders have articulated various goals for the
expanding war in Gaza, spreading confusion over how the objectives
might be achieved and on what terms the renewed campaign might end...</p>

remain about what the forces can do this time that they couldn’t do in

<p>Zucman, <em>The Triumph of Injustice</em>:"1980—2018: The Working Class Shut
Off From Economic Growth.. The picture for the period from 1980 to
2018 looks completely different [from previous era]. First, average
growth slowed down. The first characteristic of the Reagan and
post-Reagan US economy is poor growth performance...  if we look at a
[long] period —one that averages booms and busts, recessions and the
recoveries that follow—things do not look good. Since 1980, national
income per adult has grown only 1.4% on average per year. And since
the turn of the twenty-first century, it’s grown by even less than
that: 0.8% a year"</p>
<hr />
<p>The word "voodoo economics" is not my invention. George Bush Sr. used
it against Reagan in the 1980 Rep primary.</p>
<hr />
<p>If pro-business, supply-side, pro-rich approaches worked, growth would
have been much higher during the post-Reagan era who was the king of
supply-side-ism.. Corps had all kinds of handouts in the form of tax
cuts, deregulation, and a crushed labor movement.. Yet, growth post
80s has been abysmal. Why? Lopsided income distribution destroyed the
purchasing power of the middle class. They were the many, the would-be
consumers, yet the voodoo economics of Reagan and his later copycats,
Democrat and Republican alike, failed to make money trickle down to
them.</p>

<p>Alo Japan: "The 38-meter-long tugboat, which was developed and built
as part of The Nippon Foundation’s Zero Emission Ships Project, was
launched on March 28. The vessel features twin 12-cylinder
hydrogen-blended engines (4,400 horsepower class) and combines
hydrogen with traditional marine fuels to reduce CO2 emissions by
approximately 60% compared to conventional tugboats.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tugboat is equipped with facilities to store
approximately 250 kg of high-pressure hydrogen gas to maintain the
same operational performance as when using conventional fuel, the
shipbuilder explained, adding that 'in the unlikely event of failure
of the hydrogen fuel system, the vessel can operate with only
traditional marine fuels, thus ensuring the same level of safety as
conventional vessels'"</p>

agriculture and industrial projects. However, the treatment process is

<p>The Guardian: "The social housing secret: how Vienna became the

third of what their counterparts do in London, Paris or Dublin. How is
it possible?..</p>
<p>Welcome to Vienna, the city that may have cracked the code of how to
keep inner-city housing affordable. As other cities battle spiralling
rental prices, partly fuelled by inner-city apartments being used as
short-term holiday rentals or being kept strategically vacant by
property speculators, the Austrian capital bucks the trend.</p>
<p>Part of the reason Schranz’s apartment is so affordable is simple:
it’s owned by the city. In Vienna, that is (almost) the norm. The
landlord of approximately 220,000 socially rented apartments, it is
the largest home-owning city in Europe (in London, which has more than
800,000 socially rented apartments, they are owned by the local
councils). A quarter of the people who live in Vienna are social
tenants – if you also include the approximately 200,000 co-operative
