2026 targeted for completion.</p>
<p>The pipeline will be gradually expanded in the coming years and form
part of the European Hydrogen Backbone. This aims to connect the key
ports and trading areas of Antwerp, Ghent, Kallo and Zelzate. Belgium

<p>SAN: "According to data compiled in the 2022 water plan from the Texas
Water Development Board, towns and cities in the state could face
severe water shortages by 2030. Water flow in 75% of Texas rivers and
all of its major aquifers are seeing decreasing levels"</p>
<hr />
<p>SAN: "The Permian Basin, located largely in West Texas, is the most
productive U.S. oilfield and generates roughly 1 billion gallons of
wastewater daily [due to fracking]. This wastewater is highly
contaminated, containing chemicals, potentially radioactive elements,
and salt levels up to seven times higher than seawater. Despite these
challenges, lawmakers and industry leaders are exploring ways to treat
and repurpose the water for non-potable applications, such as
agriculture and industrial projects. However, the treatment process is
highly energy-intensive. Estimates suggest treating the entire volume
of wastewater from the Permian Basin could require up to 26 gigawatts
of power — more electricity than what’s generated in 30 U.S. states"</p>

<p>STOP TAKING NOTES</p>
<hr />
<p>Sarah Wynn-Williams, <em>Careless People</em>: "[Prime Minister] Kenny has
been one of Facebook’s firmest allies since the beginning, and the
Irish have gone above and beyond to court our business... With the EU
quashing the double Irish, is Facebook going to stay in Ireland?
Google and Twitter have publicly committed to keeping their operations
going, but Facebook hasn’t.</p>
<p>Sheryl [Sandberg] says, 'I appreciate that there was substantial
pressure and scrutiny this year on global tax rules and arrangements,'
and thanks Kenny for his 'careful' and 'considered' handling of
it. What she’s thanking him for is an additional five years of double
Irish for Facebook..</p>
<p>Kenny starts explaining the pressure he’s facing. 'Now, you know
Ireland had no choice but to comply with what these other
countries....'  Sheryl interrupts. 'Did you know Facebook has over
five hundred employees from fifty-four nations based in Dublin, and
we’ve just leased a building with capacity for over two thousand
employees?'  'Have I told you about the Knowledge Development Box?'
Kenny asks with a twinkle in his eye. 'Sarah, stop taking notes,'
Sheryl instructs, knowing Kenny’s about to tell us how he’s going to
keep the gravy train going for us. She doesn’t want it written
down. My notes can be subpoenaed."</p>

<p>The Guardian: "The social housing secret: how Vienna became the
world’s most livable city.. In the Austrian capital, renters pay a
third of what their counterparts do in London, Paris or Dublin. How is
it possible?..</p>
<p>Welcome to Vienna, the city that may have cracked the code of how to
keep inner-city housing affordable. As other cities battle spiralling
rental prices, partly fuelled by inner-city apartments being used as
short-term holiday rentals or being kept strategically vacant by
property speculators, the Austrian capital bucks the trend.</p>
<p>Part of the reason Schranz’s apartment is so affordable is simple:
it’s owned by the city. In Vienna, that is (almost) the norm. The
landlord of approximately 220,000 socially rented apartments, it is
the largest home-owning city in Europe (in London, which has more than
800,000 socially rented apartments, they are owned by the local
councils). A quarter of the people who live in Vienna are social
tenants – if you also include the approximately 200,000 co-operative
dwellings built with municipal subsidies, it’s more than half the
population"</p>
