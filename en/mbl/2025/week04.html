<p>Pikkety: "Biden is not wrong [about the dangers of oligarchy]. The
issue is that he has done little to oppose the oligarchic drift taking
place both in his country and globally. In the 1930s, his predecessor
Roosevelt, also deeply concerned about such trends, did not stop at
making speeches. Under his leadership, Democrats implemented a robust
policy of reducing social inequalities (with tax rates on the highest
incomes nearing 70%–80% for half a century) and investing in public
infrastructure, health, and education...</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Republican Ronald Reagan, deftly playing on nationalism
and a feeling of catching up, undertook to dismantle Roosevelt’s New
Deal. The problem was that Democrats, far from defending this legacy,
actually helped legitimize and solidify Reagan’s turn, notably under
the Clinton (1993-2001) and Obama (2009-2017) administrations.."</p>

<p>Perfect setup, a piece of the floor is mobile, the exterior geodesic

deconstruct the exterior, done. </p>

<p>ProPublica found that, for years, Microsoft leaders ignored warnings
about the flaw from one of their own engineers because they feared
that publicly acknowledging it would alienate the federal government
and cause the company to lose ground to competitors.</p>

<p>He has some pieces right but they are all put together
crooked. Democracy is broken in US, true, so bad a monarch would be
better, also true. But the culprit is corporate power, not
bureucracy. Reps <em>and</em> Democrats allowed that to happen, starting w/
Carter, then w/ Clinton, black Bill Clinton, so on.</p>
<p>NYT: "Yarvin Says Democracy Is Done.. [he says] the mainstream media
and academia, have been overrun by progressive groupthink and need to
be dissolved. He believes that government bureaucracy should be
radically gutted.. America needs to.. get over our dictator-phobia —
that American democracy is a sham, beyond fixing, and having a
monarch-style leader is the way to go"</p>

<p>Adam McKay: "What you’re seeing.. is the hyper-financialisation and
corporatisation of studios and streamers where everything now is just
immediately funnelled into the boardroom…That economic model is what's

quarterly revenue models and your only responsibility is to
shareholders, that’s a destructive machine."</p>

<p>In the right circumstance a decentralized, digital cash can become the
defacto global currency. A new kind of politics can give it that power.</p>
<hr />
<p>Currently, official currencies are based on paper. What is more
(relatively) worthless than paper?</p>
<hr />
<p>That is not the right criticism against Bitcoin or cyrpto. No money in
history, including gold, had intrinsic value. <em>Politics</em> gives value,
it decides what is valueable as currency. Politics did that for gold,
the king demanded taxes to be paid in gold, dug up gold from mines he
controlled (this is key) and gave it to his soldiers to spend, and
voila! The public rushed to sell stuff to the army to get the golds to
pay taxes. Two birds with one stone: army is supplied, the king
controls money.</p>

<p>Budget 120 mil, it will lose money. I can see where the relatively
high audience score comes from. Fine to watch once but not enough to
recommend, so word-of-mouth would not carry it further... I agree with
a commentator, if this movie was made in the 80s when the audience did
not know what to expect from a comic book movie, <em>Kraven</em> would be
well received.  But after <em>Spiderman 2</em>, <em>Infinity War</em>, it's a
different game. Still fine for me.</p>
