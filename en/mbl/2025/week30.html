<p>The UK Government has been captured by the big business
lobby... George Monbiot describes the silly contortions the current
consultation on chemical imports standards is going through in the
hope of deregulation, when 'there is in fact a means of reducing costs
while maintaining high standards: simply mirror EU rules..'"</p>
<hr />
<p>The Anglo is born pro-bihness. It is deep in their cultural DNA. The
crooked ideology spread from the Anglo, helped by their perceived
status as the WWII victor. The rest of the world should not have
copied this bizarre philosophy. But the ideology reached the end of
its runway.. It exploited all it can, and ran out of ways to hide
itself. </p>
<hr />
<p>Monbiot, <em>The Guardian</em>: "A month ago, so quietly that most of us
missed it, the government published a consultation on deregulating
chemicals...  The intention is set out at the beginning: to reduce
'costs to business'... If.. a chemical has been approved by a 'trusted
foreign jurisdiction', it should be approved for use in the UK. No
list is given of what these trusted jurisdictions are. It will be up
to ministers to decide: they can add such countries through statutory
instruments, which means without full parliamentary scrutiny...</p>
<p>Lobbyists will point out that a chemical product has been approved for
sale in the US, or Thailand or Honduras, then ask the government to
add that country as a trusted jurisdiction. If the government agrees,
'domestic evaluation' would be 'removed', meaning that no UK
investigation of the product’s health and environmental impacts will
be required.</p>
<p>In the US, to give one example, a wide range of dangerous chemical
products are approved for uses that are banned here and in many other
countries. The government has fired the gun on a race to the bottom."</p>

<p>TSJ: "The Rockefeller Influence on the Education System In the U.S,
industrialists like John D. Rockefeller poured a significant amount of
investment into education system. He created the General Education
Board at the ultimate cost of $129 million and provided major funding
for schools across the nation and was very influential in shaping the
school system... Business advisor to Rockefeller, Frederick T.Gates, a
prominent member of the General Education Board stated, 'We shall not
try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or
men of learning, or men of science'..</p>
<p>There are even reports that Rockefeller and industrial giant Andrew
Carnegie, played a significant role to influence the American
educational agenda to direct what students were taught in school. In
1914, The National Education Association alarmed by the activity of
the Carnegie and Rockefeller Foundations stated in their annual
meeting : “We view with alarm the activity of the Carnegie and
Rockefeller Foundations—agencies not in any way responsible to the
people—in their efforts to control the policies of our State
educational institutions, to fashion after their conception and to
standardize our courses of study, and to surround the institutions
with conditions which menace true academic freedom and defeat the
primary purpose of democracy as heretofore preserved inviolate in our
common schools, normal schools, and universities.'"</p>

<p>Slashgear: "Cummins.. is known for its robust diesel engines. However,
while its diesel products continue to remain high profile, many may be
unaware of the company's technology division, which has been hard at
work innovating with sustainable power alternatives. One recent
achievement is the Cummins fuel cell engine in the HY4; the first
hydrogen-powered aircraft. Using hydrogen, the HY4 utilizes an
electric powertrain allowing it to take flight with the only byproduct
being water, meaning it effectively releases zero emissions during
operation. This aircraft isn't large, only allowing for four
passengers, but it's a proof of concept, demonstrating the feasibility
of alternative fuel after 30 multi-hour flight tests. Cummins isn't
alone in its quest for eco-friendly aircraft using hydrogen"</p>

forced to reroute to Cyprus after being turned away from the Greek
island of Syros after a quayside protest over the Gaza war... Around
1,600 Israeli passengers on board the Crown Iris were prevented from
disembarking amid safety concerns when more than 300 demonstrators on
the Cycladic isle made clear they were unwelcome over Israel’s conduct
of the war and treatment of Palestinians in Gaza. A large banner
emblazoned with the words Stop the Genocide was held aloft alongside
Palestinian flags."</p>
