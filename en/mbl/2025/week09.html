<p>Ash Sarkar: How WOKE Politics is DESTROYING the Left!</p>

<p>Sounds like a good plan so far</p>
<p>The New Arab: "Egypt’s diplomatic plan for Gaza's future is set to be
presented to US President Donald Trump after receiving approval at key
upcoming summits in Riyadh and Cairo... According to a high-ranking
Egyptian diplomat based in Washington, the initiative from Cairo
is divided into two phases, which are estimated to cost tens of
billions of dollars.</p>
<p>The first phase spans ten years and primarily focuses on rebuilding
Gaza's infrastructure, housing, and residential sectors. The plan
includes the redistribution of population clusters in Gaza,
particularly by easing the density of the population in northern Gaza
and creating less populated zones near illegal Israeli settlements.</p>
<p>The second phase, still open for Arab discussion and refinement, would
start the process of establishing a Palestinian state, focusing on
creating links between Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem...</p>
<p>Another key element of the first phase is the regulation of
weapons. Cairo's approach seeks to address concerns from international
donors financing Gaza's reconstruction while respecting Palestinian
armed groups' demands of retaining their arms until a Palestinian
state is established...</p>
<p>Another crucial aspect of this stage involves the establishment of an
Arab-led committee, with Egypt at the helm, tasked with resolving
disputes between local security forces and militant factions"</p>

<p>Masse: "Having concluded that time in our Universe is a result of the
flow of aether into matter, we see that time cannot be modified in any
way (shortened or lengthened). Time is then uniform and absolute
throughout our Universe and is independent of the kinematic properties
and spatial position of any observer. Since absolute motion
(acceleration) exists in our Universe, it is to be expected that
absolute time must also exist.  Time is not relative, and time does to
alter with the motion of any reference system.</p>
<p>We see, therefore, that Einstein’s special theory of relativity, with
its kinematically dependent time, cannot be correct. We also see that,
while Newton was correct in postulating the existence of absolute
time, he was incorrect in assuming that such time is independent of
anything external.  Aether provides not only the absolute frame of
reference in our Universe, but also (together with matter) the
absolute time in our Universe. Time is not, then, a fundamental entity
of our Universe"</p>

<p>The Guardian: "Nigeria sues crypto giant Binance for $81.5bn in
economic losses and back tax..  Authorities blame Binance, the world’s
largest crypto exchange, for Nigeria’s currency woes and detained two
of its executives in 2024 after crypto websites emerged as platforms
of choice for trading the local naira currency"</p>

<p>We need boring scifi. A new show can focus on truly unknown, but
knowable stuff.. One episode they can discover how gravity
works. Another fixes quantum mechanics. Forget abt these multiple
universes, time travel. Try to imagine how stuff works in one universe
with boring time (it only flows forward).</p>
