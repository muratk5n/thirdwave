<p>"Under the French anti-waste law for a circular economy (AGEC), which
came into force in 2020 after years of development, some 70 percent of
most non-hazardous building waste had to be collected for processing
in France. The objective is gradually rising, too: In 2024, the target
was 82 percent, and it will increase to 93 percent by 2027."</p>

<p>Masse, <em>Nature of Physical Fields and Forces</em>: "A Higgs particle can
never be directly detected. It is thought to exist for only about 10 âˆ’
22 seconds. The existence of Higgs particles can only be inferred from
indirect evidence. This inferential process involves examining the
decay products of high energy particle collisions that occur within a
particle accelerator in a search for a certain decay pattern that has
been predicted for Higgs particles. Because of the massive amount of
data produced in these high energy collisions, extensive data
filtering is performed before any search for decay patterns even
begins. Statistical methods are then used to detect Higgs particles
based on a theoretical model known as the Standard Model of particle
physics. If more decay patterns are found having the expected Higgs
decay pattern than predicted by the Standard Model assuming Higgs
particles do not exist, then the existence of Higgs particles is
inferred.</p>
<p>In 2013 the existence of Higgs particles was inferred based upon such
indirect evidence. Clearly the validity of this inference depends not
only on the functioning of the extreme amount of computer filtering
necessary to obtain a meaningful signal from the immense
collision-created noise background, but also on the validity of the
Standard Model.. The Standard Model has many problems, however, and is
almost certainly wrong.. Ironically, the inferred existence of the
Higgs particle is now being used to argue for the validity of the
Standard Model"</p>

<p>Masse's publishing indicates he researched, worked on geophysics,
earthquakes. The type of new physics he discusses requires hands-on,
solid knowledge of continuum mechanics, elasticity, wave progagation
which his branch would require to know from day one. I'd pay attention
to this guy.</p>
<hr />
<p>Masse, <em>Physics: Where It Went Wrong</em>: Why does gravity exist? What
are light waves?.. Physics has provided no answers to these and many
other basic questions concerning our Universe.  You might even say
that physics has failed to discover the very nature of our
Universe. While the fundamental forces existing in our Universe have
indeed been detected, and the laws describing these forces have
generally been documented, the nature of these forces remains a total
mystery. Why has the science of physics not made more progress in
unveiling the workings of our Universe?</p>
<p>To find the answer to this question we must look back in time to the
early 1890s. It was then that a couple of perplexing problems first
arose in physics. The British physicist Lord Kelvin referred to these
problems as two 'nineteenth century clouds' over physics. When
physicists grappled with these problems, the conclusions they arrived
at set physics on a path that quickly descended into a labyrinth from
which physics has still not escaped.</p>
<p>Although physics can be employed successfully today on a practical
level, the foundations of physics now rest on quicksand. As the Nobel
prize winning physicist Richard Feynman observed, 'Itâ€™s a terrible
mix-up, and you might say itâ€™s a hopeless mess physics has got itself
worked into.'</p>
<p>The picture of reality that physics currently paints is so bizarre
and, frankly, so unbelievable, that beginning students in physics when
confronted with this picture can be excused from exclaiming 'You canâ€™t
be serious!' Unfortunately, the Alice-in-Wonderland worldview created
by modern physics has done little to achieve a better understanding of
the real Universe.  And, yes, there is a real Universe.</p>
<p>Deciphering secrets of the real Universe requires taking a new look at
some of the problems that plagued physicists over 100 years ago. As we
revisit these problems, we will find that it is possible to arrive at
conclusions quite different from those obtained many years
ago. Moreover, with our new insight into these problems, we can begin
to unravel some of the mysteries of our Universe that have puzzled
mankind for centuries"</p>

<li>1-3 month US T-bills (BIL)</li>
<li>Tesla stock.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every single respondent had TSLA as the best performer since the start
of November 2021. Here are the facts. TSLA has earned less than
nothing in nearly 40 months. It was recently down 10% over that
time. The Dow has not exactly been the S&amp;P 500 (SP500) or Nasdaq 100
(NDX), but it has certainly done what investors hope a stock portfolio
would do over that time. The average stock gained 20%, or about 1/2%
per month on average. And the T-bill ETF outperformed TSLA by more
than 22% during those 40 months"</p>

simple coding to connect the route IDs that reference stops, listing
