<h1>Week 7</h1>
<p>Standing, <em>The Precariat</em>: "As globalisation proceeded, and as
governments and corporations chased each other in making their labour
relations more flexible, the number of people in insecure forms of
labour multiplied. This was not technologically determined. As
flexible labour spread, inequalities grew, and the class structure
that underpinned industrial society gave way to something more complex
but certainly not less class based... But the policy changes and the
responses of corporations to the dictates of the globalising market
economy generated a trend around the world that was never predicted by
the neo-liberals or the political leaders who were putting their
policies into effect.</p>
<p>Millions of people, in affluent and emerging market economies, entered
the precariat, a new phenomenon even if it had shades of the past. The
precariat was not part of the ‘working class’ or the
‘proletariat’. The latter terms suggest a society consisting mostly of
workers in long-term, stable, fixed-hour jobs with established routes
of advancement, subject to unionisation and collective agreements,
with job titles their fathers and mothers would have understood,
facing local employers whose names and features they were familiar
with...</p>
<p>On top of the longer term changes towards the unemployed, the
financial meltdown of 2008–9 accelerated the growth of the global
precariat by putting more pressure on firms to cut labour costs
through flexibility measures and prompting government policies that
encouraged them.</p>
<p>Predictably, the precariat initially bore the brunt of the
shock. Temporary employees were the easiest to make redundant, simply
by not renewing contracts. Randstad, the world’s second largest
staffing company, reported sharp declines across Europe in 2008,
observing that firms were more inclined to cut jobs than in previous
recessions. But as the recession proceeded, it became clear it was a
lever for expanding the precariat. Adecco, the world’s biggest
temporary employment agency, reported that the regrowth of employment
was concentrated on temporary labour"</p>

<p>Interesting.. they pose WASM as a competitor to Docker. The two techs
do not appear comparable at first, Docker is installation management
-can take a barebones machine (real or virtual) from nothing to fully
installed w/ packages A,B,C on it- WASM is similar Java VM but more
flexible.. but they are similar in that they offer code portability,
universal execution anywhere. In that sense WASM has an advantage.</p>
<p>"The appeal of WASM lies in its write-once-run-anywhere capability,
which allows developers to compile code from various languages into a
binary format that can be executed in any environment that supports a
WASM runtime, such as the popular V8 engine. This capability stands in
stark contrast to the limitations of Docker and other container
technologies, which can be cumbersome and require extensive
configuration"</p>

<p>There are problems w/ the CPI, median wage measures too says the
article.. Link below.</p>
<p>Politico: "Voters Were Right About the Economy. The Data Was
Wrong. Here’s why unemployment is higher, wages are lower and growth
less robust than government statistics suggest... I don’t believe
those who went into this past election taking pride in the
unemployment numbers understood that the near-record low unemployment
figures — the figure was a mere 4.2 percent in November — counted
homeless people doing occasional work as “employed.” But the
implications are powerful. If you filter the statistic to include as
unemployed people who can’t find anything but part-time work or who
make a poverty wage (roughly $25,000), the percentage is actually 23.7
percent. In other words, nearly one of every four workers is
functionally unemployed in America today — hardly something to
celebrate"</p>

<p>Anderson, <em>Private Government</em>: "Most believe.. that their boss cannot
fire them for their off-hours Facebook postings, or for supporting a
political candidate their boss opposes. Yet only about half of
U.S. workers enjoy even partial protection of their off-duty speech
from employer meddling. Far fewer enjoy legal protection of their
speech on the job, except in narrowly defined circumstances. Even
where they are entitled to legal protection, as in speech promoting
union activity, their legal rights are often a virtual dead letter due
to lax enforcement: employers determined to keep out unions
immediately fire any workers who dare mention them, and the costs of
litigation make it impossible for workers to hold them accountable for
this...</p>
<p>Certainly many U.S. CEOs, who think of themselves as libertarian
individualists, would be surprised to see themselves depicted as
dictators of little.. governments. Why do we not recognize such a
pervasive part of our social landscape for what it is? Should we not
subject these forms of government to at least as much critical
scrutiny as we pay to the democratic state? My [aim] is to explain why
public discourse and political philosophy largely neglect the
pervasiveness of authoritarian governance in our work and off-hours
lives and why we should return our attention to it, and to sketch some
thoughts as to what we should do about it — for neglect of these
issues is relatively recent. They were hot topics of public discourse,
academic and legal theorizing, and political agitation from the
Industrial Revolution through the New Deal. Now they are the province
of members of marginalized academic subfields — labor historians,
labor law"</p>

<p>Hawking was against the Big Bang Theory. There is also the issue of
missing lithium, theory says certain amount of lithium should have
been created, yet it is not there. Either our measurements are wrong,
or the theory is. My bet is on the latter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Hawking, <em>A Brief History of Time</em>: "[Roger Penrose and my work]
became generally accepted and nowadays nearly everyone assumes that
the universe started with a big bang singularity. It is perhaps ironic
that, having changed my mind, I am now trying to convince other
physicists that there was in fact no singularity at the beginning of
the universe – as we shall see later, it can disappear once quantum

<p>#JacobBarandes #QM</p>
<p>The comments below are an outgrowth of JB's research who was able to
show QM is merely a reflection, a projection of physical models based
on "configuration spaces combined with stochastic dynamics". The
system evolves based on non-Markovian stochastic process, while
measurement the experimenter loses something during that transition
which results in the funky results, that are attributed to the
"unexplainable weirdness" of quantum mechanics.</p>
<p>Other gems in the video, wave functions (of QM) are not real. They
have no physical existence in reality. Ergo any talk about their
"collapse" would be unscientific.</p>

<p>Hossein-Zadeh: "Frightened by the specter of peace and/or peace
dividends [after the fall of the Berlin Wall], beneficiaries of
military spending frantically sought to invent and substitute 'new
threats' for the 'communist threat' of the Cold War era, thereby
preempting the realization of peace dividends.</p>
<p>In pursuit of this goal, beneficiaries of war and militarism found a
strong, well-established network of politically savvy allies: radical
Zionist proponents of 'greater Israel.' Because the interests of these
two powerful groups converged over fomenting war and political
convulsion in the Middle East, an ominously potent alliance was forged
between them— ominous, because the mighty U.S. war machine was now
supplemented by the almost unrivaled public relations capabilities of
the hard-line pro-Israel lobby in the United States. The alliance is
unofficial and de facto; it is subtly forged through an elaborate
network of powerful militaristic think tanks"</p>
<hr />
<p>Hossein-Zadeh: "[2006] U.S. policy makers in the Middle East would go
along with the demands of the radical Zionist lobby only if such
demands also tend to serve the special interests that those policy
makers represent or serve — not necessarily the interests of the
American people, or collective U.S. 'national interests' in
general. The fact that, as pointed out earlier, U.S. foreign policy
during the Cold War era was less accommodating to the territorial
desires of militant Zionism than in the post–Cold War period is an
indication of this point. Another corroborating indication of the
point is that as the military-industrial complex has been gaining more
and more influence over U.S. foreign policy, that policy has,
accordingly, been more and more geared to the wishes of hard-line
Zionism because, as has been frequently pointed out in this chapter,
the interests of the U.S.  military establishment converge with those
of militant Zionism over war and political convulsion in the Middle
East"</p>

<p>Syria is another case in point. They had tussles w Israel bcz they are
near (Israel causes problems to all who is near), hence Syria along
the way became mostly pacified and it acted less on Palestine issues,
would jump, even until recently, at any chance to be on good terms
with Israel.</p>
<hr />
<p>The guys near Palestine, Jordan, Egypt also happen to have,
historically, more conflicts w/ Israel, bcz of that very reason - they
were near Israel. The private military-industrial-Likud complex used
more arm twisting on them compared to the rest, bcz they had more of a
potential to fight Israel.</p>
<p>Iran came into the picture later, after the near "threat" subsided,
but the complex needed military spending, that's when Iran became
"more evil" leading them to be more vocal on the Pal issue. </p>
