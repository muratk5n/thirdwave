<p>Cardiff University: "A new way of creating hydrogen, which eliminates
direct CO₂ emissions at source, has been developed by an international
team of scientists. The process reacts hydrogen-rich and sustainably
sourced bioethanol taken from agricultural waste with water at just
270°C using a new bimetallic catalyst.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional methods, which operate between 400-600°C, are
energy-intensive and generate large amounts of CO₂, the catalyst
shifts the chemical reaction to create hydrogen without releasing
carbon dioxide as a biproduct.</p>
<p>Instead, the process co-produces high-value acetic acid, an organic
liquid used in food preservation, household cleaning products,
manufacturing and medicine, and has an annual global consumption
exceeding 15 million tons. The researchers from Peking University and
Cardiff University, say the study represents a boost in de-fossilising
the chemical industry, by replacing fossil feedstocks used in making
chemicals with an alternative carbon source.</p>

<hr />
<p>CUDA is the programming interface for the graphics card. As we
mentioned before graphics card hardware historically had to offer
massive parallelization in its numerical code to accomodate
gaming. Then some geniuses hacked around, spoke to the graphics API to
pose non-graphics math computation as if they were graphics
computations, to exploit that fast hardware. That language, interface
later became CUDA. Apparently DeepSeek guys went deeper than that,
spoke directly to the hardware itself.</p>
<hr />
<p>The underlying "AI" approach is immature, lacking; LLM in terms of
animal brain comparison is closer to an hamster rather than a
human. But we can still celebrate the the underlying tech ability that
allowed this code to be a <em>more efficient hamster</em>. Such coding can
come in handy in scientific computing too not just for "AI". Maybe
someone will use similar improvements for Finite Element computation
to detect failure in building construction, in materials, or fluid
dynamics. CUDA based GPUs along with CPUs are part of every latest
supercomputing architecture.</p>
<hr />
<p>Assembly is the rawest form of code, it is basically machine
code. Almost noone writes assembly these days, we write in more
expressive languages that are <em>translated</em> into machine code via
special "compilers" or "interpreters".</p>

<p>Hard core. Close to the metal. Good for DeepSeek.</p>
<p>"@sehugg@infosec.exchange</p>
<p>If you were wondering if assembly language optimization is still
relevant, it was partially responsible for NVDA's stock price dropping
by 17% today:</p>
<p>'DeepSeek actually programmed 20 of the 132 processing units on each
H800 specifically to manage cross-chip communications. This is
actually impossible to do in CUDA. DeepSeek engineers had to drop down
to PTX, a low-level instruction set for Nvidia GPUs that is basically
like assembly language.'"</p>

<p>"But what happens to people who have their 'wealth stored in their

<hr />
<p>Zucman: [I]n peacetime, the United States pioneered two of the key
fiscal innovations of the twentieth century.  The first of these
innovations was the introduction of a sharply progressive tax on
property. As we have seen, by the beginning of the century, US states
already had a long history of property taxation behind them. But these
property taxes had a major limitation: they were not progressive. The
same rate applied to all property owners, regardless of their
wealth. There had been efforts to make these taxes progressive over
the course of the nineteenth century, but they had failed as states
adopted 'uniformity clauses' mandating that all assets—no matter their
nature (real or financial, for instance) or the wealth of their
owners—be taxed at the same rate. In 1916, the federal government
introduced its own progressive tax on property, in the form of a
progressive tax on wealth upon death: the federal estate tax. Its
rates were initially moderate: in 1916 the top estate tax rate reached
10% for the largest estates; it rose a bit during World War I before
stabilizing at 20% in the late 1920s.</p>
<p>This changed between 1931 and 1935, when the rate applying to the top
fortunes rose from 20% to 70%. It would hover in the 70%–80% range
from 1935 to 1981. Over the course of the twentieth century, no
continental European country ever taxed large successions in direct
line (from parents to children) at more than 50%. The only exception?
Allied-occupied Germany between 1946 and 1948, when tax policy was
decided . . . by the Americans, who imposed a 60% rate"</p>
<hr />
<p>Zucman: "The reasons for the sharp increase of tax progressivity
[during early 20th century] are multifold. There was a desire to
prevent war profiteering during the First World War— the type of
profiteering that had enriched so many during the Civil War. To
prevent a 'shoddy aristocracy' from emerging again, an excess profits
tax was imposed during the conflict. At first it covered the munitions
industry only; then after America entered the war in April 1917, the
tax was extended to all firms. All profits made by corporations above
and beyond an 8% rate of return on their tangible capital—buildings,
plants, machines, etc.—were deemed abnormal. Abnormal profits were
taxed at progressive rates of up to 80% in 1918..</p>
<p>[T]he rise of progressive taxation in America [also] stemmed from the
intellectual and political changes that had begun in the 1880s and
1890s: the evolution of the Democratic party, brutally segregationist
in the South, but eager to unite low-income whites in the North and
the West against Republican financial elites by means of an
egalitarian economic platform; the social mobilization in favor of
more economic justice, in a context of surging inequality and
industrial concentration. Simply put, a growing fraction of the
population refused to see America become as unequal as Europe, which
at the time was perceived as an oligarchic antimodel"</p>

<p>Whenever Trump says "NATO members need to pay more, 2%, 5%", I hear "I

without US picking up the slack, I don't think there would be a NATO
and such excess "defense" spending. If the members truly did pay, with
that kind of money floating around, they might as well create their
own alliance without US. My guess is they won't pay and defense spending
will go down w/ NATO losing influence.</p>

<p>Standing, <em>The Precariat</em>: "As globalisation proceeded, and as
governments and corporations chased each other in making their labour
relations more flexible, the number of people in insecure forms of
labour multiplied. This was not technologically determined. As
flexible labour spread, inequalities grew, and the class structure
that underpinned industrial society gave way to something more complex
but certainly not less class based... But the policy changes and the
responses of corporations to the dictates of the globalising market
economy generated a trend around the world that was never predicted by
the neo-liberals or the political leaders who were putting their
policies into effect.</p>
<p>Millions of people, in affluent and emerging market economies, entered
the precariat, a new phenomenon even if it had shades of the past. The
precariat was not part of the ‘working class’ or the
‘proletariat’. The latter terms suggest a society consisting mostly of
workers in long-term, stable, fixed-hour jobs with established routes
of advancement, subject to unionisation and collective agreements,
with job titles their fathers and mothers would have understood,
facing local employers whose names and features they were familiar
with...</p>
<p>On top of the longer term changes towards the unemployed, the
financial meltdown of 2008–9 accelerated the growth of the global
precariat by putting more pressure on firms to cut labour costs
through flexibility measures and prompting government policies that
encouraged them.</p>
<p>Predictably, the precariat initially bore the brunt of the
shock. Temporary employees were the easiest to make redundant, simply
by not renewing contracts. Randstad, the world’s second largest
staffing company, reported sharp declines across Europe in 2008,
observing that firms were more inclined to cut jobs than in previous
recessions. But as the recession proceeded, it became clear it was a
lever for expanding the precariat. Adecco, the world’s biggest
temporary employment agency, reported that the regrowth of employment
was concentrated on temporary labour"</p>

<p>Interesting.. they pose WASM as a competitor to Docker. The two techs
do not appear comparable at first, Docker is installation management
-can take a barebones machine (real or virtual) from nothing to fully
installed w/ packages A,B,C on it- WASM is similar Java VM but more
flexible.. but they are similar in that they offer code portability,
universal execution anywhere. In that sense WASM has an advantage.</p>
<p>"The appeal of WASM lies in its write-once-run-anywhere capability,
which allows developers to compile code from various languages into a
binary format that can be executed in any environment that supports a
WASM runtime, such as the popular V8 engine. This capability stands in
stark contrast to the limitations of Docker and other container
technologies, which can be cumbersome and require extensive
configuration"</p>

<p>Politico: "Voters Were Right About the Economy. The Data Was
Wrong. Here’s why unemployment is higher, wages are lower and growth
less robust than government statistics suggest... I don’t believe
those who went into this past election taking pride in the
unemployment numbers understood that the near-record low unemployment
figures — the figure was a mere 4.2 percent in November — counted
homeless people doing occasional work as “employed.” But the
implications are powerful. If you filter the statistic to include as
unemployed people who can’t find anything but part-time work or who
make a poverty wage (roughly $25,000), the percentage is actually 23.7
percent. In other words, nearly one of every four workers is
functionally unemployed in America today — hardly something to
celebrate"</p>

<p>Anderson, <em>Private Government</em>: "Most believe.. that their boss cannot
fire them for their off-hours Facebook postings, or for supporting a

U.S. workers enjoy even partial protection of their off-duty speech
from employer meddling. Far fewer enjoy legal protection of their
speech on the job, except in narrowly defined circumstances. Even
where they are entitled to legal protection, as in speech promoting
union activity, their legal rights are often a virtual dead letter due
to lax enforcement: employers determined to keep out unions
immediately fire any workers who dare mention them, and the costs of
litigation make it impossible for workers to hold them accountable for
this...</p>
<p>Certainly many U.S. CEOs, who think of themselves as libertarian
individualists, would be surprised to see themselves depicted as
dictators of little.. governments. Why do we not recognize such a
pervasive part of our social landscape for what it is? Should we not
subject these forms of government to at least as much critical
scrutiny as we pay to the democratic state? My [aim] is to explain why
public discourse and political philosophy largely neglect the
pervasiveness of authoritarian governance in our work and off-hours
lives and why we should return our attention to it, and to sketch some
thoughts as to what we should do about it — for neglect of these
issues is relatively recent. They were hot topics of public discourse,
academic and legal theorizing, and political agitation from the

two powerful groups converged over fomenting war and political
convulsion in the Middle East, an ominously potent alliance was forged
between them— ominous, because the mighty U.S. war machine was now
supplemented by the almost unrivaled public relations capabilities of
the hard-line pro-Israel lobby in the United States. The alliance is
unofficial and de facto; it is subtly forged through an elaborate
network of powerful militaristic think tanks"</p>
<hr />
<p>Hossein-Zadeh: "[2006] U.S. policy makers in the Middle East would go
along with the demands of the radical Zionist lobby only if such
demands also tend to serve the special interests that those policy
makers represent or serve — not necessarily the interests of the
American people, or collective U.S. 'national interests' in
general. The fact that, as pointed out earlier, U.S. foreign policy
during the Cold War era was less accommodating to the territorial
desires of militant Zionism than in the post–Cold War period is an
indication of this point. Another corroborating indication of the
point is that as the military-industrial complex has been gaining more
and more influence over U.S. foreign policy, that policy has,
accordingly, been more and more geared to the wishes of hard-line
Zionism because, as has been frequently pointed out in this chapter,
the interests of the U.S.  military establishment converge with those
of militant Zionism over war and political convulsion in the Middle
East"</p>
<hr />
<p>Syria is another case in point. They had tussles w Israel bcz they are
near (Israel causes problems to all who is near), hence Syria along
the way became mostly pacified and it acted less on Palestine issues,
would jump, even until recently, at any chance to be on good terms
with Israel.</p>
<hr />
<p>The guys near Palestine, Jordan, Egypt also happen to have,
historically, more conflicts w/ Israel, bcz of that very reason - they
were near Israel. The private military-industrial-Likud complex used
more arm twisting on them compared to the rest, bcz they had more of a
potential to fight Israel.</p>
<p>Iran came into the picture later, after the near "threat" subsided,
but the complex needed military spending, that's when Iran became
"more evil" leading them to be more vocal on the Pal issue. </p>
<hr />
<p>Thats true but half the story (also a bit unfair).</p>
<p>"The further you are from Palestine, the more you cheer for the
Palestinian cause"</p>
<hr />
<p>If US support for Israel was "strategic" then why were two influential
presidents before Truman against it? Eisenhower and FDR.</p>
<hr />
<p>Truman is skooling the viewer on how it's done. Take it from the pro,
the first leader to genocide others via nuclear bomb. Ethnic Cleansing
101. Watch and learn.</p>
