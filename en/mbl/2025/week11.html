<h1>Week 11</h1>
<p>Syrian HTS has been provoking a backlash from the coastal Alevite
regions for a while.. I wonder if they wanted some kind of pushback to
which they could respond with bigger force leading to displacement,
expulsion of Alevites (Assad's minority) from their regions. These are
prime locations after all.</p>

<p>The expansion of NATO had nothing to do with strategy. If there was
any strategic brains behind the expansion the famous strategist George
Kennan would not be against it. See the <a href="2025/03/nato-russia-timeline.html">timeline</a>,
1997/02/05.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anti-Russia sentiment of the "Third-Way" Democratic party is the
result of its decades long Republicanization. Thanks to Bill Clinton
this party not only adapted right-wing econ issues it also became
hawkish, perfectly aligning itself with the military industrial
private complex. During the 90s under the guise of "helping" Russia it
helped its plunder by its internationally connected oligarchs. They
started the expansion of NATO so more weapon sales could be made by
that same industry already experienced producing weapons compatible
with NATO specs. Dems eventually became NRINOs, Not Republican in Name
Only. Their anti-Russia sentiment is completely in line with them
being bootlickers of the industry and followers of right-wing
ideologies except a few bullshit culture war issues which are just
there for cosmetics.</p>
<hr />
<p>"UA RU war started back in 2014". You could actually take the starting
point back to the 90s when US-led liberal order was wreaking havoc in
Russia, people were dying of despair and NATO was starting to expand.</p>
<hr />
<p>Historically the Democratic Party has not been anti-Russia to this
degree. What changed?</p>
<hr />
<p>If light is a wave not particle (See Robert Masse) and there can be no
spooky-action-at-a-distance, no entanglement, that means quantum
computation is a farce... This is in opposition to Barandes, whose
inherently stochastic approach to QM still allows for quantum
computation.</p>
<p>We will see who is correct based on whether quantum supremacy is
achieved (it still isn't, despite claims to the contrary) then
indivisible stochastic process explanation has a leg up. If on the
other hand faster-than-deterministic quantum computation is
impossible, then Masse's aether model has an advantage.</p>
