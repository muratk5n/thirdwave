<p>Yucky. Ppl spend 10K on Zynga games? Who are these fools?</p>
<p>"Big Brother Zynga</p>
<p>I worked at Zynga for 8 months, I can tell you all about the Good
Stuff (yes, there is good stuff going on in there!), and the
nasty-douchey stuff (yes, there is extremely CREEPY stuff going on in
there!) [..].</p>
<p>Spying on players. Getting intimate gaming data, their habits, their
networks, and how to effectively monetize given X [..].</p>
<p>Another issue was skewing gameplay for the sake of profit, example; I
actually resorted to BAD MATH, to make the case for making a feature
more fun. At the end of one sprint, a QA dude was complaining about
the drop rate of a specific item being absurdly insane, and therefore
UnFun. I looked at the code, and tweaked some values, gave it back to
QA guy, and fun was restored. Product Manager overrides this, goes for
unfun, yet more profitable version [..].</p>
<p>Internal metrics researchers often give studio wide talks on what
trends are going on. They've basically tracked down very popular
players and also players who've spent an excess of 10k into the game
[..].</p>
<p>We often tweak our features to match and maximize for a particular
gaming habit. We do this for massive populations of players. Players
are not aware of this. To me, that's a big brother like issue, someone
is measuring and monitoring your behavior intimately, and you don't
know how that data is going to be used."</p>

<p>Giordano Bruno (1548 – 1600), was a philosopher, mathematician and
astronomer. His cosmological theories went beyond the Copernican model
in proposing that the Sun was essentially a star, and moreover, that
the universe contained an infinite number of inhabited worlds
populated by other intelligent beings. He was burned at the stake by
civil authorities in 1600 after the Roman Inquisition.Bruno was deeply
influenced by the astronomical facts of the universe inherited from
Arab astrology, Neoplatonism and Renaissance Hermeticism. He is said
to have made a threatening gesture towards his judges and to have
replied: "Maiori forsan cum timore sententiam in me fertis quam ego
accipiam meaning "perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with
greater fear than I receive it."</p>

<p>Know-How and Why</p>
<p>Science education needs to focus on the process, on mathematical
modeling, on how to obtain results, instead of simply results
themselves. There is some improvement in this regard, but the old
approach and culture still persists. Even the greats of teaching were
not immune to this problem; The Feynman Lectures on Physics is mostly
about results rather than the process used to obtain those
results. The real gold is in the process, the results can change. In
Genius we read at a young age Feynman reached a point when he could
model pretty much anything he wanted, he'd run around asking people
for problems to model, and finally found one;</p>
<p>"No one had ever analyzed the behavior of light passing through a
parade of mostly transparent films thinner than a single wavelength
[..] A few days later Feynman returned with the solution: a formula
summing an infinite series of reflections back and forth from the
inner surfaces of the coatings. He showed how the combinations of
refraction and reflection would affect the phase of the light,
changing its color. Using Feynman’s theory and many hours on the
Marchant calculator, Cutler also found a way to make the color filters
his professors wanted. Developing a theory for reflection by
multiple-layer thin films was not so different for Feynman from math
team in the now distant past of Far Rockaway [his childhood home]. He
could see, or feel, the intertwined infinities of the problem, the
beam of light resonating back and forth between the pair of surfaces,
and then the next pair, and so on, and he had a giant mental kit bag
of formulas to try out."</p>
<p>Representing functions are sums of infinite series is a deeply
theoretical subject whose research was inspired by physics, beautiful
mathematics. Tranmission of such "mental kit of formulas [or
equalities, inequalities, theories, representations, etc]" should be
the goal of education, not simply dropping a finished product /
formula F = ma in a kid's lap, and have him / her solve mechanical
problems one after another.</p>
<hr />
<p>Who Need Access? You Need Access!</p>
<p>Our governments spend millions on funding research. Scientists do the
work, write up their results as papers, format the manuscripts,
prepare figures, and send them to publishers. Other scientists handle
editing for the publishers (unpaid). Yet other scientists review the
manuscripts for the editor (also unpaid). The result of all this is a
honed and polished research paper. But all too often the publisher
demands the copyright, and locks the research behind a
paywall. (Needless to say, they don’t pay the author, either.)</p>
<p>The result is that the taxpayers who funded the research don’t have
access to it.</p>
<p>“So what?”, you might ask. “I don’t want to read research papers.”
[..] The reality is that there are many groups that want and need
access to the research that they and you funded. Public access to
scientific research makes all our lives better: it makes us healthier,
better governed and better educated; it lets us live in a cleaner
environment, a more civilised society and a healthier economy.</p>

<p>Crises Economics, Roubini</p>
<p>As securitization became increasingly commonplace in the 1990s and
2000s, mortgage brokers, mortgage appraisers, ordinary banks,
investment banks, and even quasi-public institutions like Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac no longer subjected would-be borrowers to careful
scrutiny. So-called liar loans became increasingly common, as
borrowers fibbed about their income and failed to provide written
confirmation of their salary. Most infamous of all were the “NINJA
loans,” in which the borrower had No Income, No Job, (and no) Assets.</p>

<p>Here is a great book on Islam and science. I perused through it, and
boom: found a passage that talks about how Greeks were busy with
science but Byzantium Empire wasnt. Frankly I am quite tired of being
right on this issue: Romans, Byzantium and Ottomans represent a dark
chapter in human history whose ill-effects persist even today.</p>

<p>P ≠ NP?</p>
<p>In theoretical computer science a distinction is made between
branch-and-bound problems, and stuff that is computed in linear
time. Solutions for NP problems try all possibilities, but for every
found potential solution, its correctness can be checked in linear
time. Shortest route from Boston to New York? Try'em all! If you have
the final solution will be blatantly obvious; is New York in the list?
If yes, you are done. P problems are anything efficiently
solveable. Almost all of the applied mathematics is in P.</p>
<p>I argue that fussing over P ≠ NP is pointless and waste of
energy. Feynman once said [paraphrasing] "some problems are just
harder to compute [numerically]". So he was like "so what?". NP
problems are foreign to physicist because their math is designed to
keep them in P. If they come across intractable computation, they will
throw simulation, other numerical tricks at the problem, but this
either a) never happens, or b) won't be pursued until it is absolutely
necessary. Algebraic derivation continues for a long time, twists and
turns, sometimes in order to avoid intractability, sometimes for other
reasons; and when finally there is a formula, usually it is already in
P.</p>
<p>Some argue that the data generated by the Internet, images, video,
sound, result in problems that are inherently in NP. I disagree. PDE
based methods are applied to image processing successfully, and noone
knows how much in P we can remain and still succeed solving these
problems, because we haven't tried them yet. To me, pattern equals
tractable math and that equals P.</p>
<p>Surely being able to solve NP problems, using paralellism, quantum
computers, multicore architecture is necessary, a different research
track on its own, what I am saying is there is a wealth of
mathematics, modeling that is essentially P material. Mathematics,
applied or not, is mostly about exploiting properties of numbers so
they give us computable solutions in linear time. I am using the word
exploitation here, with good reason. Some tricks are akin to dressing
up a monkey and making it dance. Monkey dont know it, but it is
dancin, and doing something for its viewers, conciously or not. That
takes genius, creativity, understanding the problem domain and a good
amount of mad skillz.</p>
<hr />
<p>A like-based system for artistic products (or even other things) can
result in interesting side applications. Each creation in the registry
can also carry a list of references, or sources that the creation used
as its inspiration. Then, every "like" (or a portion of it) received
by this creation can automatically be distributed people in the
references list.</p>
<p>Corollary: In our general scheme, copying and stealing is encouraged,
and no punishment of any kind is condoned. That said, potential
disagreement in this scheme can (should) be around the issue of
reference, that is being cited properly in a digital work, thus
"missing out" on the likes received by that work. Therefore, it is
conceivable one involving a legal mechanism of sorts in order to be
included in a reference list. That is ok. But again, no punishment,
and rabid stealing (copying) is encouraged and in fact the prime
f...ing directive of this system.</p>
<hr />
<p>Psychology &amp; Computation Link</p>
<p>There are interesting parallels between algorithms / computation and
Jungian psychology.</p>
<p>Si is introverted sensing, it looks at the current events and
"remembers" similar events, objects, sayings from the past. Then, Si
is basically a nearest-neighbour approach that is used in Machine
Learning. It has no model, the model is the data itself.</p>
<p>Ti is the ultimate modeler. It tries to summarize data, tries to set
clear boundaries between definitions so that categorizations and
predictions are more accurate. Ti in ML is anything that uses a
graphical, analytical, structure based model such as Bayesian Nets,
ID3, or already cooked up formula with some missing parameters. Si
cannot predict, classify things that it did not see before. Ti can.</p>
<p>Te has logic, measurement, contingency planning. In compsci terms it
is a combo of a recursive depth-first search, logic and sensor data
processing. It has rudimentary modeling abilities. It is quick so it
probably utilizes a cache (hah!).</p>
<p>Ne, Ni are the ultimate non-deterministic generator of
possibilities. They are probably "multi-threaded", as they generate
many possibilities, sometimes blindly, these many possibilities can be
executed in parallel. Even then however, their job might take a long
time to finish, which must be why Ni,Ne is known to keep working even
when a person is asleep, busy with other things. A "discovery" popping
into a scientist's head is simply Ni, Ne finishing its work. There's
nothing mysterious about it. Note: Generating possible solutions and
verifying them are seperate tasks of course (per our P ≠ NP?
discussion), Ne,Ni generate, Ti,Te verify.</p>
<hr />
<p>Stereotypes</p>
<p>Knowing someone, at a certain level, is about being able to peg
them. If you see behaviour X a hundred times, 101th time you expect
it, somewhat different way -with some sauce-, then you feel like you
know that person. Culturally, in US, and relationship-wise between
subcultures, minorities and majorities, a form of this pegging happens
all the time. Distance is a major factor in the country, so people
need to form connection fast and efficiently over vast distances [1],
between varying subgroups; so categorizing someone becomes ever more
important.</p>
<p>Surely stereotypes can have a bad side, US culture balances that
through its "letting go / prohibition" code.. This tug-of-war works
fine on this issue, most of the time; The mainstream stance of
prohibiting oneself on racial, stereotypical issues is the rule,
while, as the exception, an undercurrent of comedy, art, silly talk
between friends manages to play with this hot potato, dancing on the
issue, and still make some substantial statements, while at the same
time giving people a funny group to belong to.</p>
<p>In terms of comedy some of the best jokes I heard in US were on
racial, stereotypical issues. It seems the more comical the stereotype
is, the more it is embraced, and that perhaps pushes the uglier, bad
forms of stereotyping away from society; Examples are many: Mexicans
can't park, black people love fried chicken, etc. This process is part
of "creating culture" in US. I once watched an Italian-American
comedian in a comedy club, his jokes would start about himself, how
guido his friends are, then move on to black men, then to oral sex,
after which he would just drop the bomb: "Brothers won't eat that shit
unless it's fried!". A comedy club full of all ethnicities would just
explode in laughter.</p>

<p>Stop Trying To Make Money From Distribution</p>
<p>As Tim O'Reily said, this link sums up Holywood's piracy problem
perfectly.</p>
<p>Before Internet distributing content was inefficient, hence
distributors could provide a service by making the delivery of content
just a tad more efficient. The problem is publishers also hooked their
payment-receiving mechanism into this delivery as it was logical at
the time; A needs product X, B delivers it, A pays to B before
delivery, who passes the earnings onto C.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2day. Free distribution of content is highly efficient
-- noone can beat it and provide a "service" by replacing
this. Unfortunately, now content producers lose their "hook", the
place where they inserted their payment receiving step.</p>
<p>This is why I've been saying, a new payment mechanism must assume
distribution is now seperate from payment mechanism, for good. Since
legal enforcement is out of question (Net distribution is,
well.. distributed, but enforcement is concentrated, 3rd wave vs 2nd
wave, latter loses) we need to make it very easy to indicate interest,
"likes" in a product. If given the chance, I am sure people will
indicate their likes, dislikes; in fact, there is nothing people like
to do more in their leisure time.</p>
<p>Free market, capitalism worked because it was mostly based on what was
natural. In this day and age sharing and distribution of content is
natural. This is the new "constant" and any successful system needs to
take that constant into account, rather than fighting it. You can try
to fight it of course but the natural will kick your ass. Just ask the
Soviets. However, with one simple change of viewpoint, free
distribution of content can be seen as a major service, a benefit to
all consumers and content creators alike.</p>
<p>I am not saying my proposal is the best, or the only method. I was
simply trying to demonstrate an alternative that takes the new
constant into account.</p>

<p>Stretched Thin</p>
<p>To stretch this far … modernity must necessarily be culturally thin. …
It is a generic culture, this culture of the television age, of
asphalt, advertising, uniformity, and waste. And those who feed on it,
those who live by it, become generic people who also are thin, who
stretch wide and belong to nowhere in particular.</p>

<p>Larry Wasserman: "A World Without Referees.. Our current peer review
is an authoritarian system resembling a priesthood or a guild. It made
sense in the 1600’s when it was invented. Over 300 years later we are
still using the same system [..]  If we used the same printing methods
as we did in 1665 it would be considered laughable. And yet few
question our ancient refereeing process. [..] I argue that our current
peer review process is bad and should be eliminated.</p>
<p>The refereeing process is very noisy, time consuming and arbitrary. We
should be disseminating our research as widely as possible. Instead,
we let two or three referees stand in between our work and the rest of
our field. I think that most people are so used to our system, that
they reflexively defend it when it is criticized. The purpose of doing
research is to create new knowledge. This knowledge is useless unless
it is disseminated. Refereeing is an impediment to dissemination.</p>
<p>Every experienced researcher that I know has many stories about having
papers rejected because of unfair referee reports. Some of this can be
written off as sour grapes, but not all of it. In the last 24 years I
have been an author, referee, associate editor and editor. I have seen
many cases where one referee rejected a paper and another equally
qualified referee accepted it. I am quite sure that if I had sent the
paper to two other referees, anything could have happened. Referee
reports are strongly affected by the personality, mood and disposition
of the referee. Is it fair that you work hard on something for two
years only to have it casually dismissed by a couple of people who
might happen to be in a bad mood or who feel they have to be critical
for the sake of being critical?</p>
<p>Some will argue that refereeing provides quality control. This is an
illusion. Plenty of bad papers get published and plenty of good papers
get rejected. Many think that the stamp of approval by having a paper
accepted by the refereeing process is crucial for maintaining the
integrity of the field. This attitude treats a field as if it is a
priesthood with a set of infallible, wise elders deciding what is good
and what is bad. It is also like a guild, which protects itself by
making it harder for outsiders to compete with insiders.</p>
<p>We should think about our field like a marketplace of ideas. Everyone
should be free to put their ideas out there. There is no need for
referees. Good ideas will get recognized, used and cited. Bad ideas
will be ignored. This process will be imperfect. But is it really
better to have two or three people decide the fate of your work?</p>
<p>Young statisticians (and some of us not so young ones) put our papers
on the preprint server arXiv (www.arXiv.org). This is the best and
easiest way to disseminate research. If you don’t check arXiv for new
papers every day, then you are really missing out [..]</p>
<p>When I criticize the peer review process I find that people are quick
to agree with me. But when I suggest getting rid of it, I usually find
that people rush to defend it. Is it because the system is good or is
it because we are so used to it that we just assume it has to be this
way? In three years we will reach the 350th birthday of the peer
review system. Let’s hope we can come up with better ideas before
then"</p>
