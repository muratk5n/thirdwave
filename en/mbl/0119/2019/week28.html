<p>Just saw this by the metro line today, warning passengers about a
27500 Volt electric line! Suggesting not to approach more than 2
meters. I believe they are talking about the lines that go above the
trains to power them?</p>
<p><img width="300" src="train1.png"/></p>
<p>BTW this is an incredibly stupid design. You could safely and cleanly power the trains with hydrogen, no need for such crazy warnings and no need need for mile long cables. </p>
<hr />
<p>In May 2019, Angstrom Advanced Inc officially completed the Microgrid
hydrogen-based power-storage system demonstration project. [..] This
groundbreaking project was the first of its kind on the East Coast of
the United States.[..]</p>
<p>The success of this project also proved the feasibility of
establishing and implementing “Hydrogen Energy Communities” or
“Hydrogen Cities”. In such a scenario, hydrogen would be the critical
medium in bringing together renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro,
etc.), power, heat and utilities, and the ability for grid
peak-shift. Additionally, hydrogen can be used as a backup power
source, as well as the fuel for Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles
(FCVs). The ultimate goal of the “Hydrogen Energy Communities” is to
take advantage of hydrogen as a clean, zero emission energy source to
achieve sustainable development.</p>

<p>Yang is Just Do It Nike Man type. When in doubt, act (obviously don't
act for the f--k of it either). These ppl lock themselves into
inaction overthinking stuff. They also worry too much about saying
what others expect them to say (in the negative). </p>
<hr />
<p>I am starting to realize ppl make money through obfuscation. Why
explain when u can hide? Take the simplest thing a spin up an
obnoxious story around it? Imbeciles (goaded to be that way by ppl who
should know better) will eat it up. So called "religion", science,
journalism is replete with this.</p>
<hr />
<p>In my writeups, in order to show end result I take snapshots from "the
system", and save them as simple images. "The system" could be my code
(for pendulum, double pendulum not too hard), or lunar lander, cart
pole from an outside simulator. In either case snapshots are taken,
saved, and I combine snapshots with ImageMagick for an animated gif
and share that as simple file.</p>
<p>So reader can see end result immediately, one click, see animation,
and more important, he sees how those snapshots are taken from the
system, shared as code in the writeup.</p>
<p>Setup requirements, nearly zero. Just one additional package install
on Python, if that.</p>
<p>Wiggers niggers dont get it. Less dependence, simplicity is better. </p>
<hr />
<p>Docker tech can create a fully installed machine from a single
image. Instead of writing down a long list of "install this and this
first" some ppl like to just share a docker image.</p>
<p>But it is an overkill for this case. </p>
<hr />
<p>I am emailing frickin MIT professor who taught such classes. He has
code but to make it work gazillion instl steps needed (readme actually
talks abt using a docker image!), and he turned the code into a
"framework" (which means scattering shit in multiple places so it
becomes extremely hard to follow). I bet he is thinking "Imma do a
startup one day, maybe, and this is how pro code looks like".</p>
<p>On an old vid of his I saw a boring-ass code on screen, i asked him
"where is that?". He is like yo that's gone man.</p>
<p>Bitch what have u done? Guy is failing with his first duty to the

<p>Calculus works well for physics because Calculus digs into the very
small (then puts it back together - derivation / integration) and the
real world also consists of the very small. So the mathematical method
mirrors the real world.</p>

block of thought?</p>

<p>You say much of "Asimo [robot] is overly controlled. Humans and many
species in nature evolved to be underactuated, that is guiding their
system with minimal control". Does this relate to waves and life?</p>
<p><span style="color:red">It does</span></p>
<p>Both industrial age and agrarian age are examples are overly
controlled environments. Agg is a very hard business, everything needs
to be right in order for crops to grow. The land is controlled, with
clear borders around it, watered, fertilized at certain intervals. The
crops are genetically engineered to be a certain way, chosen after
years and years of "unnatural" selection.</p>
<p>In a factory, robot arms are overly controlled, every move is planned
for, and the driving control is in exact proportion to the outcome you
get (Asimo is the end result of robotic arm technology, something

<p>Tooze, Crashed</p>
<p>[After 2008 crisis and QE] Dollars were cheap for everyone. Any
investor who was willing to take a gamble on exchange rate movements
could borrow cheaply in dollars and invest in high-yielding emerging
markets. Assuming the dollar did not sharply appreciate before the
debt was due, it would be a profitable carry trade. By the middle of
2015, governments and businesses outside America would pile up $9.8
trillion of debts denominated in dollars. Much of this went to rich,
developed world economies. But $3.3 trillion was owed by ​emerging
market borrowers, both government and private. From the point of view
of the yield-chasing investor, the more exotic the securities the
better. (..) In May 2013 the boom reached its peak, with the $11
billion ten-year bond issued by Petrobas, Brazil’s state-owned oil
company. It was the largest bond issue ever by an emerging market
corporation. Demand was so great that the yield on the Petrobas issue
fell to as little as 4.35 percent, less than many sovereign
borrowers. (..)</p>
<p>This global interest in emerging market debt was exciting from the
point of view of the borrowers. But it also exposed them to serious
risks. Huge, aggressively managed funds crowded into tight markets. As
the IMF pointed out, given that the largest five hundred asset
management companies had more than $70 trillion in their portfolios, a
1 percent reallocation implied a flow in or out of an asset class of
$700 billion. This was enough either to swamp or to starve the
emerging markets. The withdrawal of funds that had caused such stress
in 2008 around the periphery of the world economy had amounted to only
$246 billion. The unprecedented inflow that transformed the outlook of
those same economies in 2012 was $368 billion.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Brrr</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Tooze</p>
<p>That the astonishing events in Congress in 2013 did not lead to an
immediate crisis in the bond market pointed to the resilience of the
US Treasurys as the global safe asset of choice. (..) Ultimately, the
market for IOUs drawn on the American taxpayer was underwritten by the
Fed. (..) America’s central bank left no doubt that it backed its
government’s debt. QE3 bond purchases provided immediate support,
keeping prices up and rates down. (..)</p>
<p>The real question was the likely fallout in the financial markets and
money markets when the Fed changed its stance. Any move to moderate
the Fed’s bond purchases, let alone to unwind its position, implied a
comprehensive adjustment in the willingness of the markets to absorb
not only a greater volume of bonds but also some of the maturity
mismatch that the Fed was carrying. And that would have to happen at
the same time as short-term interest rates were nudging up. If, on the
other hand, the Fed continued QE3, its balance sheet would further
inflate, bond prices would remain elevated, interest rates would
remain stuck near zero and imbalances would further accumulate. In
2008 the Fed had embarked on a vertiginous tightrope walk from which
there was no way back to the certainties of the great moderation. (..)</p>
<p>In 2008 the Fed had intervened to stop the market from imploding. It
had pumped trillions into the financial system. Now the markets hung
on its every word.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Yeah no shit</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Tooze</p>
<p>The swap lines that had been so crucial to stabilizing global
financial markets and which had been uncapped in October 2008 were now 
being established on a permanent basis. As in 2008, this network had
limits. None of the most fragile emerging markets were included in the
inner core of the Fed’s swap network. But they were not left out in
the cold either. What began to take shape were regional
subnetworks. These were uneven. There was nothing of note around the
core European central banks. But in Asia the central banks were more
active. In September 2013, as anxiety about the Fed’s tapering rose to
a crescendo, India negotiated an increase in its existing swap line
arrangement with Japan from $10 billion to $50 billion. In December
Japan doubled the swap line facilities it offered to Indonesia and the
Philippines and announced that it would be looking to negotiate
similar bargains with Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. Japan’s
enormous reserve holdings of dollar assets, second only to those of
China’s, gave it the means to offer such facilities. And in the event
of a crisis, the Bank of Japan could always draw on the Fed. Thus
dollar liquidity would percolate out through the entire system.</p>
<p>As in 2008–2009, in 2013 the public bluster about the need for a new
monetary order and a “de-Americanized world” distracted from the
reality that a powerful new network of liquidity provision was being
rolled out across the world economy. The swap-lines story stayed
buried on the interior pages of the Financial Times and the Wall
Street Journal. There was no fanfare, no new Bretton Woods
Conference. There was also no congressional or parliamentary
approval. These were administrative measures. But they were also far
more than that. Five years on from the crisis, while markets remained
unsettled and the American political system was racked by dissension,
the global dollar system was being given a new and unprecedentedly
expansive foundation.</p>
<p>About the technical efficacy of the swap lines there was little
doubt. Their political legitimacy was a different matter. And in the
autumn of 2013 one couldn’t help thinking of another of America’s
technical systems of ​power that had been revealed earlier that year:
the NSA’s electronic surveillance network. The network that Edward
Snowden exposed in early June also centered on US power and
technological capacity. It too was no American monolith. Like the Fed,
the NSA worked through local agencies. It too promised to provide a
blanket of security for the United States and its allies. Of course
spying and exchanging currencies were not the same things. But they
did have in common that their functional power and administrative
efficacy were not matched by anything resembling public political
authorization. They were testimony, at one and the same time, to the
continuing significance of US global power and the difficulty in
justifying that power in public either in the United States or in the
countries whose governments and business interests were enrolled in
America’s network.</p>

<p>Question</p>
<p>One of the most famous singers [Bulent Ersoy] in TR is a
transwoman. How is that possible in a convervative country?</p>
<p><span style="color:red">It's a result of palace culture</span></p>
<p>In agrarian era the palace is always associated with excess,
weirdness. In the peasant's mind, the weirdo village life he is living
must be multiplied 10-fold "over there" in the palace. Look at the
show <em>Game of Thrones</em>, there is incest, barbarism of all kinds (not
saying trans choice is like that, bear with me), resembling the
gladiator shows during days of Rome. This is "the ultimate landowners"
as seen by the rest.</p>
<p>In such cultures different sexual choices are entertainment for the
palace, the king and queen, if not overtly practiced by the "royals"
themselves. Then the peasant is interested in these things because
they are practiced, or an object of interest by the king or queen. </p>
<p>Normal people (as in nomadic, adaptable) would not be fascinated by
unorthodox choices and look at them as things in a zoo, but just let
them be.</p>
<p>Story: I did a joke at Ersoy's expense once; As I mentioned before
<em>ağa</em> is the landowner patriarch male in TR. And this famous
transperson, in her woman form, comes very much across as a
<em>hanımağa</em>, a she-boss; it's the weirdest thing to see. But she is
liberal in her views, not overly militant... One time she made an
anti-militant comment and I said "well that was very courageous to
say, she surely knows how to MAN UP (the comment was <em>erkek
kadınmış</em>)". Heh :o I drop them jokes man.. that's right.</p>

<p>The leaders of Wall Street had never liked Trump. They clearly
preferred the Clinton brand. He had paid them back in kind and he had
won. The question of who was boss had been answered.</p>
<p>Trump’s about-face once in office was utterly unabashed. He would do
as befitted a boss-president. There would be a bonfire of regulations
and in particular those of his predecessor. The thought of doing a
“big number” on Dodd-Frank pleased POTUS. And it pleased him also to
bestow favors on and receive applause from powerful interests, even
those he had previously made a show of attacking. As he told a meeting
of CEOs in April 2017: “For the bankers in the room, they’ll be very
happy.” To have favors lavished on them by the man who had pilloried
them on the stump might seem topsy-turvy. But the bankers were not
complaining. As the Financial Times commented: “Imagine going to the
races, betting 98 per cent of your stake on the favourite [Clinton],
which loses in the final stretch, and going home with huge winnings.”
As far as Wall Street was concerned it turned out that the game of
politics was heads I win, tails you lose. Neither the politicians nor
Wall Street gave a second thought to the angry voters who had actually
put Trump in the White House.</p>

<p>The resulting tax bill that passed both houses of Congress in December
​2017 was hugely controversial. The sugar coating, such as it was,
consisted of across-the-board reductions in personal income taxation
and cuts to exemptions that principally hit high-income local
taxpayers in states that voted Democratic. But these were time
limited. Within a few years many lower-income Americans would be
paying higher taxes. Of more lasting benefit to the very wealthy was
raising the estate tax threshold to $11 million. And what really
mattered was a 40 percent cut in the rate of business taxation, which
meant that profits could either be retained for growth or paid out to
shareholders. Given the vast inequality in wealth holding and
particularly in the holding of equity—the top quintile of the American
income distribution owns 90 percent of corporate equity—the benefits
go to the better off.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Some tax cut</span></p>
<hr />
<p>Tooze</p>
<p>His main shtick was that he was a businessman, a deal maker. And
because his business was real estate, Trump lived the American
business cycle close up.  As Hyman Minsky, the legendary analyst of
financial crises, observed already in 1990, Donald Trump was the very
epitome of a Ponzi scheme capitalist, living hand to mouth by
borrowing against the expected appreciation of his assets.  As a
result, crises punctuated Trump’s career. He was hit hard by the early
1990s recession, almost losing his business. By 2008 he was less
vulnerable, having diversified into media and branding. But his real
estate exposure was still significant. Indeed, he was seeking to
increase it. In 2006 he started a mortgage brokerage and announced
plans to open a mortgage lending business. Luckily for Trump, neither
got off the ground. By 2008 his casino business was failing again and
would ultimately close. But Trump’s real vulnerability was a gigantic
condo development in Chicago. It was a spectacular project, the
tallest building to be built in the United States since the Sears
Tower, and sales had originally gone well.</p>
<p>But in 2008 Chicago condo sales stopped dead. By the fall it was clear
that Trump and his business partners were in trouble. Since his
bankruptcies of the 1990s, Trump was no longer on good terms with the
major American banks, so the Chicago project got its funding mainly
from Deutsche Bank’s North American real estate arm.  In the first
week of November 2008, as Barack Obama celebrated his election victory
with his adoring Chicago base, Deutsche and Trump went to war.
Deutsche sued for $40 million, for which Trump was personally
liable. Trump responded with an astonishingly audacious legal
broadside. He claimed that the greatest financial crisis since 1929
constituted force majeure, akin to a natural disaster. He therefore
demanded more time for the project to pay off.  Deutsche’s own suit
was typical of a predatory and dangerous lender that had helped to
bring on the crisis. Trump’s countersuit claimed $3 billion in
compensation for the damage it was causing to his reputation. It was
pure legal swordplay, but it bought him the time he needed.  In a
tight spot Trump is nothing if not pragmatic, and he was certainly not
one to be squeamish about the maxims of free-market economics. Faced
with the 2008 crisis he knew that American business needed all the
help it could get. He had decades of experience working the subsidies
available from American government. He liked the cut of Obama’s jib;
2009 was not his moment to get on the anti-Obama bandwagon.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">So what's in those tax returns?</span></p>

<p>Since these older and more economically powerful property owners
dominate the electorate, politicians are reduced to doing their best
Man of La Mancha impersonations: they “Dream the Impossible Dream”,
and aspire to bring about “affordable” expensive housing.</p>
<p>The best way to do that is to give young people a government handout
to let them climb onto the property ladder. A name evocative of
concern for the young, such as the “First Home Buyers Grant” in
Australia, or even more evocative, the “Help to Buy” Scheme in the UK,
helps make the policy look worthy.</p>
<p>This way, politicians are seen to be doing something to help the
young, deflecting blame onto others (as they rail against rigid
supply, which is not their responsibility), while actually fuelling
the engine that drives house prices higher faster than consumer prices
(and household incomes)[..]</p>
<p>That fuel is leverage – the rising level of household debt compared to
income. Not only can politicians do something about this by changing
the regulations on bank lending – they have done something about it in
the past, by changing the regulations in ways that allowed this bubble
to form in the first place.</p>
<p>House prices only took off when politicians followed the advice of
economists – and the special pleading of the finance sector – that the
economy would work so much better if the heavy hand of government
regulation was lifted, and industry was allowed to innovate. However,
the innovations we got were not industrial but financial, as banks
found ever more ways to persuade households (and also corporations) to
take on more debt.</p>
<p>Here the UK data is remarkable, even in the context of a worldwide
trend to higher levels of leverage. Between 1880 and 1980, private
debt in the UK fluctuated as a percentage of GDP, yet it never once
reached 75% of GDP. But in 1982, both household and corporate debt
took off.</p>
<p>In 1982, total private debt was equivalent to 61% of GDP, split
equally between households and corporations. 25 years later, as the
global financial crisis unfolded, private debt was three times larger
at 197% of GDP, again split 50:50 between households and corporations.</p>
<p>The key changes to legislation that occurred in 1982 is the UK let
banks muscle into the mortgage market that was previously dominated by
building societies. This was sold in terms of improving competition in
the mortgage market, to the benefit of house buyers – allegedly,
mortgage costs would fall.</p>
<p>But its most profound impact was something much more insidious: it
enabled the creation of credit money to fuel rising house prices,
setting off a feedback loop that only ended in 2008.</p>

<p>Beard et al, from <em>Introduction to Feedback Control</em></p>
<p>I had a need for a new masters student in my research group and hired
one of the top students in the class. We had designed a gimbal system
for a small unmanned air vehicle, and needed a control system
implemented on a microcontroller for the gimbal. I tasked this new
masters student to model the gimbal and design the control system. I
was a surprised by how much the student struggled with this task,
especially understanding where to begin and how to model the
gimbal. If I had given him a transfer function and asked him to design
a PID controller, or if I had given him a state space model and asked
him to design an observer and controller for the system, he would not
have had any difficulty. But he did not know how to do an end-to-end
design that required developing models for the system, including
physical constraints</p>
<p><span style="color:red">There is a lot of that going around</span></p>
<p>Education is increasingly pigeonholing ppl into areas, into weird
-isms, noone can do end-to-end design anymore. It's like Isaac Newton
knowing some algebra but not being able to compute anything, or vica
versa. We complain science became huge, one person cannot manage it
all, but the essential core really did not, a lot of concepts taught
are umimportant and a core general science / engineering knowledge
with solid math and computation can be learned by all who are
such inclined.</p>

<p>How Obama Failed: [The flaws in the admin] were baked in. As Hundt
makes clear, despite Hillary Clinton’s primary loss, the Obama
residency essentially became the second Clinton administration that
she and her family’s entourage had been planning for, with Obama
surprising John Podesta by tapping him to lead his transition. Podesta
staffed top posts with Clintonite neoliberals, ensuring their ideology
predominated in the administration</p>
<p>It’s ironic that Obama’s defenders point to Republican obstructionism
to explain away his administration’s inadequacies, when Hundt makes
clear that the primary source of obstructionism was coming from inside
the house</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Some call Biden Hillary 2.0</span></p>
<p>But IMO Obama was Hillary 2.0. Biden would be Hillary 3.0.</p>
<p>Why did Bam become a Clinton continuation? Well, if you are a young
guy with a weird name who is really green, you have to belong
somewhere. Clintons provided Obama that umbrella. Then the usual
suspects filled the ranks of his admin, financial industry was saved,
citizens were not.</p>
