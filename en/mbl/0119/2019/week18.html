<p>Producivity growth. Look at how low it is recently</p>
<p>Sad truth is the economy does not need so many workers or farmers. 2% generate the food in US. &lt;15% are blue collar workers. We dont need f--ing teachers. Sorry.</p>
<p>The reason is same amt of output is generated with less people, displaced ppl go to shit jobs (which is most of the jobs) for which the need is questionable, overall productivity goes down.</p>

<p>Every country is stuck in the wave they were born. TR invented farming, still tries to increase employment in "sheepf--ing" i.e. piss poor farmer tied to a land (and his goat). Industrial nations want full-employment in industry that pays fair "wage".</p>

<p>I think Edward Witten is too narrow minded with his tunnel vision on string/M-theory as the(!) only way. Not one (new) testable prediction has been made by string theory. (Besides the microscopic explanation of BH entropy and many math conjectures). The era Edward Witten is over.</p>

<p>keeps saying for 30 yrs is changing TR land inherit laws so land is
not divided (i.e. smaller)</p>
<p>Bcz there are incredible efficiencies in big lands, industrialized
farming that way.</p>
<p>Dingbat populists and the left fall in this trap all he the time;
aiming full employment. Once they aim for it, guess what, they get
it. But efficiency is lost. Every1 hates work, become cynical</p>
<p>Growth falters, wages suck (bcz ppl <em>really</em> are not needed in this
economy), no inflation, no savings, just big ugly bubbles in places
ppl now cannot touch - the stock market and real estate.</p>
