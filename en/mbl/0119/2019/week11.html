<p>CEOs can want to "burn the shortsellers" occasionally, and act on it if they can. The reflex is not unnormal. Bezos did it, changed amzn invsmt, profit balance, and burned them. What he did not do is meddling in shady shit, like "funding secured at blah".</p>

<p>Why is Beto running for president in 2003? the democratic base today is hardened and more ideological and saw vapid centrism eat away their pensions and wages and gave us two decades of perma-war. Nobody wants this. How can someone so badly misread the times?</p>

<p>So the left needs to prepare itself for the most likely outcome. When centrist implode thru Biden, you want to be far away from that so none of the shit spills on you. </p>
<p>That means distancing urself from the "moderates". Given a choice btw bashing them or the rightz, u bash them</p>
<p>.. if they have a shortcoming, you bring it up. Dont wait for the "other side" to do it.</p>

<p>DJT win would be because of incumb, popularity, econ on his
watch. Elections are about incumbents, about people, leaders not about
the pretty "ideas" anyone puts forward. But the dumbass centrist
spewing will coincide with the pummeling in ppls minds, so it will be
discredited.</p>
<hr />
<p>Actually the most likely outcome is still good for
progressives. Frontrunner Biden gets nom, proceeds to election spewing
his dumbass centrist bullshit, but even with econ slowdown (growth
near 1%) gets pummeled to the ground by Trump (pred is
clear). "Moderates" are discredited</p>
<p>Of course I'd like Bernie getting nom (likely) and the Hail Mary win
of presidency. That'd be a BIG Hail Mary.</p>
