<p>Speech at its simplest is 1D data. It can be represented by a sum of sine waves - u could extract those base waves through sinusoidal regression. Save those regression results in a DB per each word (how many are there, like 20-30K?) and for TTS, while reading doc per word look up its waves, sum them up, play, repeat. </p>

<p>What is a low correlation portfolio and why is it good?</p>
<p>It's simple - prices form a time series, then low or negative
correlation would mean one is down when the other is not, vica
versa. So if one instrument took a hit, the others would save you. The
"bad"s cancel out, and, if tests show, overall, the portfolio
generates returns, we are a-ok.</p>
<p>Correlation between two series is known to many. How about correlation
of 3 series or more? For that, there is the correlation matrix. Say we
have Apple, IBM, and Exxon,</p>
<pre><code class="python">import pandas as pd, pandas_datareader.data as web, datetime

start=datetime.datetime(2001, 1, 1)
end=datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 1)
insts1 = ['AAPL','IBM','XOM']
df1 = web.DataReader(insts1, 'yahoo', start, end)['Adj Close']
ret = df1.pct_change()
H = ret.corr()
w = np.ones((1,len(insts1))) * 1./len(insts1)
print ('score', np.float(np.dot(np.dot(w,H), w.T)))
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">score 0.6021293830308531
</code></pre>

<p>Correlation matrix of the prices gives H, then <code>w'H w</code> gives a single
score to judge to portfolio by.  <code>w</code> is the weights, how we allocate /
distribute money to each instrument. For simplicity we picked
equal. 1/3, 1/3, 1/3.</p>
<p>In this example we see intra-correlation is high (1 would be
highest). Can we do better? There are two tech stocks in there, AAPL
and IBM. How about we replace IBM with a retail-ish tech stock? Say
Amazon?</p>
<pre><code class="python">insts2 = ['AAPL','AMZN','XOM']
df2 = web.DataReader(insts2, 'yahoo', start, end)['Adj Close']
ret = df2.pct_change()
H = ret.corr()
print ('score', np.float(np.dot(np.dot(w,H), w.T)))
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="text">score 0.548369645733854
</code></pre>

<p>The correlation went down. If the overall returns prove (backtest)
better, this is the better portfolio.</p>
<p>Ideally u want correlation to be a big fat zero. These were just
random symbols off the top of my head</p>

<p>The fight. "Learning" statistically as in deep nets vs. formulating
the problem somehow starting from principles... A similar version of
this fight actually <a href="https://www.tor.com/2011/06/21/norvig-vs-chomsky-and-the-fight-for-the-future-of-ai/">took place</a>
between Chomsky and Norvig (of Google) a while back on natural
language processing. Chomsky does not like ML methods. I'd say he is
right on this one.</p>
<p>(Chomsky knows a thing or two about stats u see, hard sciences and
experiment, so can speak on such issues with some authority)</p>
<p>A lot of the successes of the recent AI methods (which are great and I
applaud) are in the category of weak AI. This is the first level of
pattern recognition - especially for to/fro conversion type tasks if
you remain in the same domain, e.g. speech sounds to text of those
sounds u can do some damage, the "AI" methods can work. But
interpreting that speech, translating its ideas are still far out of
reach.</p>
<p>We also talked about clean formulas vs. constants before (which DL ppl
call weights or coefficients) in physics context. Basically in that
formula vs. weights trade-off, DL chose <strong>all</strong> weights, all the
time. Their "models" such as they are, can have <em>millions</em> of
weights. This is the price you pay for not burning brain cells on
formulating, modeling a problem.</p>

<p>Realist interpretation of physics can be based on "human
interpretable" constructs and still be real - meaning stuff that
exists wout observer being there. I think the problem with these
comments is its use of "common sense" and "everyday". What is the
elements, the clay from which these comments are formed? For the
non-technical they are springs, pulleys, balls, wind, elasticity,
force, movement, stuff rotating around other stuff (atoms, or planets)
or simulacra (easily relatable these days thanks to movies).</p>
<p>The "everyday" items for STEM ppl are graphs, matrices, DEs, the
interplay btw the continuous and the discrete..  Graphs can be
directed, non-directed, some algorithms can work on them, in various
speeds, like shortest path, minimum spanning tree, etc.</p>
<p>This is important, because you can construct a reality from these
structures. Like a game - and the root of the game would be a
graph. Or a probability distribution (needs pseudorandomness knowledge
which isnt really random), still <strong>real</strong>, same for everyone.</p>
<p>I'd say realists vs crackers are divided half'n half these days, among
those who matter... So the former group is nothing to be dismissed.</p>

<p>Tiggers be flailing on IRel - the odd behaviour is partially due to a
"little Putin" strategy. Little Putin strategy takes a page out of
Putin's playbook ; you find areas, regions where the other side does
not want to be involved completely, so you get involved 100% bcz u
know the backlash wont be severe, so u cause some discomfort for the
other side. Like Russia invading Georgia, the West doesnt like it, but
will not engage militarily, it doesnt worth that much to them, so u
look tough. Tigger obviously cannot do this at the scale RU can,
that's why I call it the "little Putin strategy".</p>
<p>It's a way of looking tough - but in fact, it's like acting like a
little bitch isn't it? Engaging in something when your security isn't
truly at stake, against someone who is not a threat, and usually not
in the same class. Just to get some headlines?</p>

<p>If Corbyn was decisive one way or another on Brexit he'd have a
chance. They had to be decisive, and scare people - with truth (also
offer some way out if Brit culture codes have such a thing). U need to

<p>We live in interesting times. It gives rise to a strange new
vocabulary. Like issue-non-issue. Or in finance the good news that is
bad news. Watch a finance show u hear them argue all the time "this
was good news, but is good news good news or bad news 😶 [for the stock
market, bcz good news can cause FED to raise rates that'll lower the
laughing gas, causing the market go down]". </p>

<p>BJ succeeded in painting others as the ones stopping Brexit, "the will

rode that to victory.</p>

something like this. It keeps on giving.</p>

<p>I am definitely studying this subject irreverently (per Feynman)
#optimization</p>
<hr />
<p>What happens if, in a society, ppl who do not buy into the national
narrative, are culturally different and focused in one region? It can
happen, see <a href="https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2013/03/allegience-of-peon-4.html">Gellner</a>
who wrote the book on nationhood,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People can be categorized as tall and short, as fat and thin, dark and light, and in many other ways. Clearly, there is simply no limit to the number of ways in which people can be classified. Most of the possible classifications will be of no interest whatever. But some of them become socially and politically very important. They are those which I am tempted to call entropy-resistant.</p>
<p>A classification is entropy-resistant if it is based on an attribute which has a marked tendency not to become, even with the passage of time since the initial establishment of an industrial society, evenly dispersed throughout the entire society. In such an entropy-resistant case, those individuals who are characterized by the trait in question tend to be concentrated in one part or on the totality of society. The rest of this argument can now easily be anticipated: entropy-resistant traits constitute a very serious problem for industrial society.</p>

<p>Well, noone should run these ppl over, displace them, or destroy
them. They'd need their own local governance, Scots, the Irish, or the
Uighurs.</p>
