<p>Haha.. just when I think I heard it all, there is more.</p>
<p>"Brexistential crisis"</p>
<hr />
<p>Niiice. Merkel dropped the H-bomb.</p>
<hr />
<p>I dont know abt Brexit, but May could be exiting soon.</p>
<hr />
<p>Damn, Vonnegut was a POW at Dresden, luckily jailed in a safe place while UK fire bombed the place. He came out, Dresden was gone. "It was like the surface of the moon" he said later. &gt;20 ppl killed.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDF (Electricite de France) is a BUY</p>
<hr />
<p>It's funny SV ppl are the types who want to deal <em>least</em> with people
somehow ended up dealing w them the most. Ethics, speech, privacy,
etc. Social nets really broke the camel's back.</p>
<p>You are up in ppl's biznitch, then gov will be up in yours - cuz gov's
biznitch is people.</p>
<p>A lot of times non coder types look for neferiousness in Net
platforms. I guarantee u, what they do most of the time is trying to
reduce their involvement. Dude is flagged for sharing gif, wouldnt it
be better to warn first?</p>
<p>Yes but they could use human reward / punish cycle to reduce their
involvement (involvement is so non-code and not cool). If u flag and
punish, only real non-offenders are motivated to fight back (legally
what-not). That's fine for them.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is still the <em>small</em> matter of nuclear waste... I said small
bcz, u know, April Fools.</p>
<p>@ShellenbergerMD</p>
<p>"Just 5 nuclear plants in Pennsylvania (PA) produce</p>
<ul>
<li>more electricity than <em>all</em> the solar in US</li>
<li>21x more power than all solar-wind in PA</li>
<li>93% of PAâ€™s clean power</li>
<li>4,500 high-paying jobs"</li>
