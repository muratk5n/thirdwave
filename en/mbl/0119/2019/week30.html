<p>National Dem polling might be misleading, regional ones, since cands
probably put more energy there, could be more indicative. Iowa, New
Hamp, South Car, Cali are 5, 7, 22, 1 ahead for Biden (ahead of the
next most pop cand). So SC needs some attention.. Whoever is after the

<p>Good profiling trick: look at intense disagg, conflict - usually the
two sides of the conf have the same type. Like Varoufuckis vs
Schauble, both are Mellow Meadow. Who gets the most brutal digs into
Trump?  Colbert. Etc..</p>
<p>Whatever we might know of other types, we only truly now our own
kind.</p>
<p>And when someone like us does something wrong, we insinctively know
where it comes from, so the attacks can be more pointed.</p>

likely to offer many insight or opportunities for surprise; the result
can be predicted with very high confidence long in advance. QD is
roughly about demonstrating the internal (theoretical) compatibility
of unitary quantum dynamics with the appearance of classicality (and,
in particular, wavefunction collapse)'.</p>

<p>Yes because such systems are the easiest to find the data for, and ML
is extremely reliant on data. Like, "does the picture have a cat or
not?". You can find training data very easily for that.</p>

<p>He is right. Sethian works with PDEs (used in phy) on all kinds of
interesting problems. We need more of this, but instead a lot of brain
power is wasted on the "statistical thing", where practitioners mainly
chase more and more data.</p>

<p>Mathematical physics has lots of "forms". These are precooked
formulations, like Euler-Lagrange, or the Hamiltonian. U need a
certain thing find thr form for it, plug in, done.</p>

<p>Forgot to mention Israel as an energy starved country hence with a
need to innovate in this area along with Japan.</p>
<p>"Since its founding in 2011, GenCell has grown to more than 80
employees, including many veterans of the Apollo &amp; Mir projects. The

<p>Johnson and Nixon did more for moon landing than JFK. Johnson
recommended moonlanding as a goal to begin with. But JFK looks good on
TV (and is a LTCB type like Beto always getting more accolades than
they deserve) so he is sadly the "front man" for this historical
moment.</p>

<p>Some said TG movie feels like a commercial rather than a movie. It's
true. You could take any 5 second sequence from most of it, and mumble
the name of some product afterwards and it would be like a commercial.</p>
<hr />
<p>Funny story - guy walks up to M. Ironside one day and says "f$!#k
you!". MI is like WTH? Apparently dude was so inspired by <em>Top Gun</em> he
joined the mil, became a fighter pilot, but the life wasn't like the
movie. He was pissed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Cruise says the new <em>Top Gun</em> is a love letter to aviation. I get the
angle; they didnt want to make it a love letter to war.</p>

<p>Hananuer is a billionaire in favor of redistribution. So not "education will fix inequality" type of billionaire, like R Dalio.</p>
