<p>We’ve been lying about a shortage of scientists continuously since
Sputnik. We have too many scientists relative to our anemic level of
interest in paying for the basic research that created our modern
economy.</p>
<p>Why do we believe a &gt;60YO lie? Because of who tells it.</p>
<p>Scientists.</p>

<p>UQM, BLDP, PLUG, HYGS, FCELL,  PCELL.ST , NELL.OL, HEX.OL,  IMPC.ST , MYFC.ST  are all a BUY.</p>

<p>Dalio: more education to fix poverty. Great solution, jackass. This guy cant even put five words together. He is in no position to be "generating ideas".</p>
<hr />
<p>Yang's inexperience could be overlooked but his polsci "lay of the land" missteps cannot. He nearly did that circum. debate thing, that's a sign the campaign is ran by neophytes.</p>
<p>IDW intervened at the last second IMO and he got a respectable interview. Otherwise he was toast.</p>
<p>The idea for the original debate must have been planted "elsewhere", so Shapiro was probably bitchslapped from all directions.. That'd be hilarious to watch.</p>
<p>You see how these fuckers play the game though... U have to be alert. Very alert.</p>

<p>There is a Github repo on it </p>

<p>Replying to @dweinberger</p>
<p>Sloppy and loaded language. "Ethics" too quickly devolves into "<em>my</em> ethics", which devolves into politics and parochialism. Likewise for "justice".  And "should" is just lecturing, which tends drive people away</p>

<p>Goldcucks dream abt a world that cannot be. Sound money isn't what u think it is.</p>
<hr />
<p>Capital is not "allocated" in capitalism, it is <em>created</em> while giving credit. Banks have no need for savings in order to lend. </p>
<p>That's why it's moronic to talk abt the price of money for lending. Demand 4 money is infinite, so is the suppy (printing). It can't be priced.</p>

<p>Buttgeek sounds like squarely for M4A. He doesnt want to be pinned
down in certain yes/no questions, but the oscillation is around single
payer 4 sure.</p>
<p>Not everyone is Bernie. Giving a negative headline by one wrong
sentence would scare most politicians. U r but one guy, and there is
this entire machinery dissecting your every move.</p>
<p>With Steophnaopoplouuopuuoupoouuouous the headline he was fishing for
is "I Will Replace Private Companies", in a way that sounds like "I Am
A Gay Commie Who Will Also Take Your Child".</p>
<p>So you dont give that to him. You oscillate while indicating you are
for what u r for.</p>

<p>No food, and now no electricity. Yeah I bet that's US's fault too.. In a country where oil is cheaper than water. </p>
