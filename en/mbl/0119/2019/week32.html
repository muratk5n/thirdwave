<p>Funny I was thinking abt a drone design the other day and thought, for
a cheap design, "remote automation" (as in within 1 km) could be
possible; Drone is in constant radio contact, relays sensor, takes
command, processing done on smartphone. Delays, choppy data factored
in the compute; it could work.</p>
<p>This is to keep the drone skeletal, small, and  light.</p>

with Hispanics.</p>
<p>Plus Kurds have been here longer than tigga, and I use the T word
ethnically the way nats use. The term is laden confusion, in reality
so-called "Turks" and Kurds are both ancient, local to the area -Turks
did not wholly come from Central Asia as some dumb nats
claim-. Whoever arrived in little numbers melted away into the main
population. The current culture is a continuation of what was here
before that arrival.</p>

isn't that important. Brits and Americans both speak English, but are

<p>3 million $ award given to supergravity related research. </p>
<p>Hossfelder thinks this was a very bad idea:</p>
<p>"To date, we have no evidence that supergravity is a correct
description of nature. Supergravity may one day become useful to
calculate properties of certain materials, but so far this research
direction has not led to much.</p>
<p>The works by Ferrera, Freedman, and van Nieuwenhuizen have arguably
been influential, if by influential you mean that papers have been
written about it. Supergravity and supersymmetry are mathematically
very fertile ideas. They lend themselves to calculations that
otherwise would not be possible and that is how, in the past four
decades, physicists have successfully built a beautiful,
supersymmetric, math-castle on nothing but thin air.</p>
<p>Awarding a scientific prize, especially one accompanied by so much
publicity, for an idea that has no evidence speaking for it, sends the
message that in the foundations of physics contact to observation is
no longer relevant"</p>

<p>Is reincarnation possible? Sure; in an ancestral simulation scenario
reincarnation would be a player entering the game multiple times. In
fact, in our profiling one group of attributes talks abt the general
inclination of a type (their negative), like <em>High Horse</em> carrying the
attributes of a king or queen, or another of a surgent... These could
be interpreted as these ppl <em>played</em> a king or queen in earlier games
(now they are trying something else). </p>
<p>I am sure a lot of people feel there is something ancient, persistent
inside of them, that even predates their birth, this could be it. Like
the mystic says "there is another me inside of me (Y. Emre)", could be
loosely refering to a shadow-reversal as in <em>Was That Really Me?</em> (by
Quenk) maybe? But maybe also a more persistent type attribute which is
from an "earlier game".</p>

<p>HFC in India, awesome. </p>
<p>"C.N.R. Rao [..] on Monday said [India's] focus should be making fuel
cells from sodium and hydrogen.</p>
<p>The market is currently attuned towards lithium-based fuel cells but
that element is not available in the country as also cobalt.</p>
<p>Both the elements are crucial in making of batteries to power mobile
phones, laptops and even electric vehicles.</p>
<p>'The government has correctly called for the move towards electric
vehicles; I have no issue with that but since we have no reserves of
either lithium or cobalt and China having effectively taken control
over Congo where cobalt is available in abundance, we have to shift
towards sodium and hydrogen. We can do magnesium fuel cells too but it
is in short supply' he said.</p>
<p>[..] Rao also pointed out that certain elements like lithium and even
helium are at risk of being depleted and lost forever.</p>
<p>'We have been able to prove in the laboratory about the efficiency of
fuel cells made of sodium, magnesium and hydrogen. Fuel cells of
hydrogen cause no pollution as water is a by-product. The challenge is
to scale it to commercial operations and it is very much possible,' he
maintained.</p>

<p>A lot of people wrongly assume elementary teaching is beneath a top
scientist. Nothing can be further from the truth. Einstein taught
algebra to little kids all the time. When I received a tutorial from a
researcher / scientist (undergrad Chemistry), I knew this has to be
the way to learn and teach. In a span of 30 minutes I must have
received instruction worth half a semester. I guarantee it, there is
nothing like it.</p>
<p>Not all top researchers are good teachers of course, but it's not hard
to find ppl who are good at both. Take that and let Internet do its
thing; amplify that one voice to millions. Instead of trolls, let
quality troll.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why is it good to have researchers, the best, teaching (even for the

<p>Dirty coal to clean H2. Exciting!</p>
<p>I keep saying the best place to do carbon capture is in the beginning
of the energy cycle. This is the only fossil I can tolerate.</p>
<p>How abt fracking into H2? No. Bcz the fracking process itself has
polluting side-effects.</p>
<p>"Japan and Australia have taken their first steps to create new export
industry which will convert the world’s most polluting fuel, coal,
into its cleanest, hydrogen, and ship it in liquefied form from
Australia to Japan.</p>
<p>The $350 million experiment is based on a vast reserve of low-grade
coal in Victoria, which was for decades the southern state’s major
source of electricity, until most of the power plants were closed
because of the pollution they generated".</p>

<p>[facepalm] Just saw paper "Path optimization for marine vehicles in
ocean currents using reinforcement learning". "AI" bitches everywhere.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is someone who did research on flattest path calculation for
ground terrain using analytical math, dude is Swedish.</p>
<hr />
<p>I should have known to look for flattest path solution in marine
literature. The problem is probably nearly identical to "ship
traveling in minimal time through water currents in the sea" problem,
as in fighting currents = fighting uphill elevation. For the West
(therefore modern science) this would be more pressing problem to
think abt.</p>
<hr />
<p>"In Europe there are negative interest rates on government and some
corporate debt, which pays for redundant bureaucracies and favoured
zombie industries.</p>
<p>In the US there are negative gas prices in an area of Texas the size
of a European country. The producers will pay you to take away their
pipeline-grade gas. If that ploy fails, they flare it in fires so
large they can be seen from space. [..]</p>
<p>Oil and gas is a faith-based industry.</p>
<p>During the past few years that faith has been well rewarded in the
Permian Basin of Texas. Gas produced there is processed and sold at
Waha, where pipelines take it to the huge hub and market in Cushing
near Oklahoma City, or to petrochemical plants and liquefied gas
export terminals on the coast of Texas and Louisiana [..].</p>
<p>Why would E&amp;P companies produce gas for a negative revenue? The answer
would be that they can sell the oil, as well as the associated natural
gas liquids, for actual cash, though at a transportation discount.</p>
<p>As for the gas, it can be cheaper for them to place a vertical pipe
near their wells and set it on fire. This flaring is legal for a few
days after a well is discovered, or when there is an equipment failure
but it is frowned upon by the Railroad Commission of Texas (RRC), the
state regulator.</p>
<p>Yet no flaring application has been turned down by the RRC for at
least a couple of years. This annoys environmentally minded Texans,
who allege that satellite photos show twice as much flaring as
publicly declared".</p>
