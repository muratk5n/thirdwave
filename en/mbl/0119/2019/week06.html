<p>No need for "smart grid" that is supposedly based on "DC energy" and will reroute energy to where it is needed. This is 90s style old-skool Al Gore environmentalism. There is already an energy carrier based on molecules, with xport infrastructure to take it where it's needed.</p>

<p>Downsample to 3%, data for 1 huge grid becomes 2 MB. Sheeeeet</p>
<hr />
<p>If u have continous func, u can get elevation data at any
resolution. This is key for flattest path algo.</p>
<p>Next, next step; seeing if heat flow PDE can be used to find
path. Higher elev can be seen less thermal conductvity, start pos is
heat source, target is sink </p>
<hr />
<p>Imma fit Gaussian bumps on elevation data w RBF to have smooth, continous funcs as mountains. </p>
<p>However 100m corresponds to 0.001 change on lat/lon. A box (20,30),(21,31) has 1 mil pts. Solution: downsample. Dude did it, reports good results on the fit.</p>

<p>TV guy said "Martin Luther Coon"? What a jackass..</p>
<p>Funny story with that word. First time I heard it was during OJ
trials. There was an OJ joke for everything. This one goes "one day OJ
comes to the courtroom, in a Hawaii shirt, summer outfit. His lawyer
asks him 'what is going on OJ? Why r u dressed like this?'</p>
<p>OJ says 'I thought you said we was going to Cancun'. Lawyer says 'no,
I said you are going to the can, coon'". Joke was triggered bcz we
were going to Cancun.</p>
<p>Guy who told us the joke was racially .. everything, except black,
hence the joke I guess.</p>
<p>Funnier thing is the same guy ran someone over with his car, while
drunk, killing him, and went to the slammer himself for 10 years for
manslaughter :| How's that 4 a story?</p>
