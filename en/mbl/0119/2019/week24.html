<p>Gov (left) help to people will decrease connections, will make us more
human, that is a spread out populace with intermitten
connectivity. People who like to have sex with goat and sheep can
still do that of course, but I am thinking they will be in the
minority, as the culture is repugnant and revolting. Catholicism,
Ottoman Caliphate as cultures are all extensions of this which need to
be culturally cleansed.</p>

him. And it is right, during FDR days, he would seem like a regular

<p>The Bill of Rights part is to reclaim the box of goodies which other
candidates claim they'll dole out once in power. He turned the volume
up, and took all the goodies back. And tied it into a coherent

<p>Now I know why I keep seeing this guy (Rajan) at honco meetings. He
became India CB head later but it always seemed like he was treated as
a prominent voice on econ issues. This must be why.</p>
<p>"Every year in August the elite of the central banking and monetary
economics world gathers at a resort in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. In
August 2005 the theme of the conference was not the crisis brewing in
the US housing market but a celebration in honor of the outgoing Fed
chairman, Alan Greenspan. Most of the presentations were appropriately
upbeat. But one rang an off note. It was given by Raghuram G. Rajan,
an Indian by birth but a fully paid-up member of the American
economics elite, professor at the Chicago Booth business school and
chief economist at the IMF. His paper bore the heretical title “Has
Financial Development Made the World Riskier?”57 Rajan worried that
the dramatic expansion of modern financial intermediation was building
up a dangerous new appetite for risk. At Greenspan’s farewell party,
the message was not welcome. Rajan was slapped down by Larry
Summers. Wielding his full authority as former Treasury secretary,
Summers introduced himself as “someone who has learned a great deal
about this subject from Alan Greenspan . . . and . . . who finds the
basic, slightly Luddite premise of this paper to be largely
misguided.”58 To highlight risks in a complex, modern financial
system, as Rajan was tactlessly doing, was to invite “restriction” and
other “misguided policy impulses.” It would be like giving up air
travel for fear of crashes."</p>

<p>Interesting</p>
<p>Electrifiers ran amok. It is a disease.</p>
<p>Also right on increased complexity. In a software project, a good
architect constantly tries to fight complexity (especially important
in software because it is very easy to increase complexity as the
initial cost of just typings some stuff is incredibly low) , and say
no. A recent example is Boeing with its MAX debacle, unnecessarily
increased
complexity. <a href="https://lwn.net/2000/0914/a/lt-debugger.php3">Here</a> is
Linus Torvalds' comment on a question, some programmers were trying to
include a so-called kernel debugger in the Linux code (a tool that
helps trace bugs, hence the name) when he lost it.</p>
<p>Let's not forget Linux is the largest software code base humanity ever
created, when the previous software management guru Fred Brooks in his
<em>The Mythical Man-Month</em> said such a scale for a software project was
impossible to reach (he was talking about a possible Star Wars project
code base which the Linux project surpassed in terms of LOC many times
over). And it was all done through loosely connected (this was key
IMO) programmers through text-based version management tools.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.history.com/news/how-did-the-gold-standard-contribute-to-the-great-depression">Article</a></p>
<p>A number of complex factors helped to create the conditions necessary
for the Great Depression, and adherence to the gold standard was just
one of those factors. A slowing economy combined with the stock market
crash of 1929 and a subsequent wave of bank failures in 1930 and 1931
led to crippling levels of deflation. Soon, the frightened public
began hoarding gold. European countries began to abandon the gold
standard.</p>
<p>The United States and other countries on the gold standard couldn’t
increase their money supplies to stimulate the economy. Great Britain
became the first to drop off the gold standard in 1931. Other
countries soon followed.</p>
<p>Gold is Old</p>
<p>There are some liberterians who are still high on the fumes of this
thing, they are best to abandon their dream. Keynes was right to call
gold "a barbaraous relic". There has been no successful gold-pegged
currencies in history. All trials ended badly; gold is deflationary.
Graeber showed armies make money what it is; king orders x to be
mined, gives x to soldiers, takes tax in x. All of a sudden the public
is stepping over eachother to sell their produce to those soldiers to
earn x. Money is created. It has always been so (now it is US military
over oil).</p>
<p>Surely with fiat an unwanted side-effect could be the reverse of
deflation, inflation, but that falls under the rubric of a political
decision. Democratically elected official will pay the price for that
inflation if it becomes excessive. My point is just to avoid the "bad"
inflation we cannot tie the hands of economic governance.</p>
<hr />
<p>Question</p>
<p>There are some liberterians among conservatives, aren't they better kind
of conservatives?</p>
<p>No</p>
<p>Because they are generally anti-war and pro-freedom they might come
across as preferable. But make no mistake, these people are just
deluded as the next con. A lot of their shtick comes from 1st wave
land-based sheepfucker that we call the peasant. If we remember agro
empires rose on the tax collected from them, using their sons as
soldiers. This is where a lot of the knee-jerk reactions of the
libertard comes from; he doesn't want to be taxed, he surely doesn't
want to lose a son. He also doesn't want his money to lose value
(hence gold, something "trustworty", in his mind, that he can bury,
hide on his land).</p>
<p>What happens to the greater society?  Libertard, wedded to his land,
his sheep, does not care. I heard one say once, about policing,
security issues "well I have a private security / guard on my land"
and the stupid son of a bitch truly thought that comment got him off
the hook. But here is where he makes his first logical
mistake. Because "his land" such as it is, depends on a larger
apparatus that he does not <em>want</em> to care about. But if a mob gathered
outside his land and wanted to take it, there is little his $10/hour
rent-a-cop could do. So libertard depends on the societal apparatus to
not only keep the mob at bay, but keep them <em>not</em> unhappy enough so
they would not think of coming for his estate.</p>

<p>Question</p>
<p>Why did Elizabeth Warren shun Fox News when many other Democrats did
town halls?</p>
<p>Warren didnt shun FN for the reasons she says (I dont want to support
their extremism). She shunned them because she is making a play for
the centrist Democrats. It can work.  She is also revealing policy
after policy, which ppl dont understand shit about, but it reinforces
an image of her as someone taking care of citizens.</p>
<p>Why the move for centrists? Let's not forget, we are not at national
elections yet. First, a candidate needs the Dem nomination. Looking at
Biden's numbers we can see there is a sizeable centrist chunk. Warren
is combative with DJT for this reason (pro impeachement, no FN, etc).</p>
<p>Also previously, that whole native American genetic testing "debacle"
worked for Warren. She was ridiculed by Trump, but that's a good
thing, it made her more of a nemesis, the un-Trump. She engineered it
for that reason. DJT was also ridiculed by Bam, remember?</p>
<p>This is how the pro-anti, for-against mechanism works. People have
vague notions about candidates, standing out in any way helps, any
emotional memory people can remember you by is good, in terms of
politicking of course.</p>

first-hand).</p>

<p>Two reasons why CCS (carbon capture and storage) on industrial
hydrogen production is much more affordable than on fossil power
plants: 1. Hydrogen production from natural gas, e.g. by steam methane
reforming, results in a pure CO2 stream, while power plants produce a
mixture.</p>
<p>Right</p>
<p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201906081075738684-oil-economic-forum/">Sputnik News</a></p>
<p>Once you have got hydrogen, you have a phenomenal energy vector [..]
And if you can replace natural gas and only lose say 15% of the
heating value inefficiencies that is a pretty good deal because you
can make the hydrogen with 100% carbon capture. Now, if you want to
charge a battery in 10 minutes for a domestic car, you need hundreds
of kilowatts of power, hundreds, you need thick cables, you need a lot
of… and that infrastructure doesn't exist.</p>
<p>True</p>
<p>IMO the best point in the fossil cycle to go clean is in the
beginning. Once hydrocarbon is "reformed" in to H2, all the way down
the line the energy can remain clean. No risk of methane leaks, no
risk of carbon.  Generating H2 this way is a win-win for all, both for
fossil fuel companies and the public.</p>

<p>A. Tooze, <em>Crashed</em></p>
<p>Whereas Russia had reacted to its humiliation in the 1990s by
accumulating a substantial currency reserve, the East European states
had no such defense. For them security lay in integration with the
West, or at least so they imagined. With the Fed having used swap
lines to stabilize a core group of economies in which American
interests were undeniable, one might have expected the ECB to extend
similar support to the East European neighbors of the eurozone.</p>
<p>Membership in the EU and NATO was supposed to have promoted Eastern
Europe from their inferior status in the global pecking
order. Ex-members of the Warsaw Pact and former Soviet republics had
eagerly refashioned themselves as exponents of Donald Rumsfeld’s new
Europe. They now found their prospects for growth shattered and their
governments thrown back to where their post-Communist careers had
begun, as lesser sovereigns, and more or less resentful supplicants
for international financial assistance. The IMF was their last
resort</p>

absence of financial help at the time of need. Need I remind ppl

the G20, on March 23 the Chinese central bank chairman, Zhou
Xiaochuan, surprised the world by launching his own call for a new
Bretton Woods. The Chinese had been at the original meeting in 1944
and they knew their economic history. As far as Zhou was concerned, it
was time to revisit the fundamental decisions made in 1944. It was
thanks to America’s overweening power at the end of World War II that
the dollar had been established as the global reserve currency. Ever
since, America had been free to spend at will while accumulating huge
deficits. To ensure true stability, as John Maynard Keynes had argued
for the British delegation in 1944, the world needed a global monetary
unit independent of any national currency. The obvious candidate, Zhou
suggested, was the IMF’s unit of accounting and credit, the Special
Drawing Rights (SDR)."</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Keynes' idea was bancor, not SDR</span></p>
<p>SDR is gold backed, controlled by IMF which is a terrible, terrible
idea. Word is CH is buying lots of gold to prepare for an SDR
future. That future might not come to pass and you might get stuck
with that gold. Watch out.</p>
<p>Deficits, and surplusses are not anybody's "fault"; we cannot
"implore" countries to act nice, we need to design a system that will
nudge actors in the optimal direction. </p>

<p>A. Tooze, <em>Crashed</em></p>
<p>Despite the decision endorsed by the president on March 15, Geithner
never agreed with restructuring Citigroup. No one had ever unraveled a
bank of Citigroup’s complexity. It was not clear that the Treasury had
the resources and legal authority to carry it through. A protracted
restructuring would spook ​the markets. In the words of a later
postmortem compiled by one of Obama’s closest advisers, the Treasury
“slow walked” the Citigroup proposal. Though this delaying action
bordered on insubordination, Obama showed little inclination to impose
his will [..]</p>
<p>In the spring of 2009, rather than going over to the offensive, Obama
and Geithner positioned themselves as the last line of defense for
America’s financial system. It was their self-appointed mission to
calm “the mob.” Of course, playing the good cop is a tried-and-tested
negotiating tactic. But it is usually combined with stiff
demands. Someone has to play bad cop. What was remarkable in 2009 was
how little the Obama administration asked in return for the protection
it offered. To the amazement of the hardened Wall Street deal makers,
the only item on the table on March 27 was voluntary restraint on
compensation. That was even less than Paulson had asked for six months
earlier when he foisted TARP on them. In truth, if there were
pitchforks being wielded by anyone in the spring of 2009, it was not
by the Left against the banks but by the right-wing populists. With
the lavish attention of Fox News and subsidies from friendly
oligarchs, they were organizing themselves in the Tea Party
movement. The target of their anger was not Wall Street but the
liberals in the White House. The uncomfortable truth was that the
Obamians lacked pitchforks of their own. Reviled by the Right and
suspected by the Left of being in the pocket of Wall Street, as
Geithner himself admitted, the administration would find itself in
political “no-man’s land.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Haha</span></p>
<p>So Bam gave the go-ahead and Geithner totally ignored him. Duh!</p>

<p>G. Friedman</p>
<p>On [24/6], U.S. national security adviser John Bolton will meet with
his Israeli and Russian counterparts in Jerusalem [.. Russia] is
allied with Iran, but that alliance has made Iran dependent, not
equal. Russia is the only major power not hostile to Iran, but that’s
already changing in Syria. If Russia turns on Tehran, it would
intensify Iran’s isolation and array forces against Iran that it could
not resist.</p>
<p>In exchange for joining a powerful anti-Iran coalition, Russia will
look to the U.S. – which can deliver its interests. Moscow will want
an end to economic sanctions, a guarantee of U.S. neutrality on
Ukraine, and likely a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Poland and
Romania. While Russia may have interests in the Middle East, it’s
these burning issues that it really cares about, and it is here that
Russia will try to gain leverage. For the U.S., sanctions are not
critical – neither Crimea nor eastern Ukraine are major issues – and
while it doesn’t trust Russia enough to withdraw from Poland and
Romania, Russia can probably live with that. Israel, for its part,
would be happy with anything that massively weakens Iran.</p>
<p>The talks may well stick to far more trivial issues than this, and
there will be no grand bargain on the table. Yet, senior security
officials from these three countries are not meeting in Jerusalem to
make some pious declaration. It seems they’ll be there to do business"</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Hmmm</span></p>
<p>What is cooking up there?</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hC3ckLqsL5M?t=52">Tim Maudlin</a></p>
<p>[Paraphrasing] Quantum mechanics isn't really a theory; it doesn't
specify a physical ontology, as in "tell me what exists in the
physical world, etc."  Copenhagen QM just computes some stuff, and
pulls out random explanations out of its ass to justify its
computational method.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">He is right</span></p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hC3ckLqsL5M?t=688">Tim Maudlin</a></p>
<p>Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment to point out the sillyness
of Copenhagen QM. Schrodinger was trying to point out a flaw.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Somehow it became a QM "teaching" tool</span></p>
<p>SC is not cooked up to give you a sexy, scifi talking point that u
impress your friends with at a party. But somehow SC is now part of an
accepted reality that is Cop QM.</p>
<p>I guess people will do anything to be "mystified" with stuff.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/hC3ckLqsL5M?t=743">Tim Maudlin</a></p>
<p>[How did we get here? Paraphrasing] Early on, Bohr's "magnetic
personality" played a role, he mystified the field, said that "you
can't understand QM and shouldnt be able to". Later bcz of the
Americans, who like to "compute stuff", the attitude was just "shut up
and compute".</p>
<p><span style="color:red">True</span></p>
<p>US culturally likes action, "doing it"; that could have been a factor
too, they were culturally more susceptible to this stuff than the
rest.</p>
<p>Now we understand what Feynman meant when he said "if you think you
understand QM you really don't". The brilliant educator that he was,
he was trying to point out the state of QM as it was then.</p>
<p>Why did Feynman follow suit with the rest? IMO he joined the field at
a young age when Cop QM was accelerating. Then he contributed to the
"computation" himself (Feynman diagrams are exactly that, a way to
calculate) earning him the Nobel prize, so in many ways, he was badly
placed to make a new path.</p>
<hr />
<p>TM</p>
<p>All we have [in Cop QM] is a very effective method to make predictions.</p>
<p><span style="color:red">So Cop QM is the Deep Shit of physics?</span></p>
<p>Effective predictions, no explanations. Right on.</p>

<p>Libertard, goldcucks love this guy tho. "When goods dont cross..?"
Guess who was Germany's biggest trading partner before the world wars?
It starts with F, ends with rance.</p>
<p>Unfettered trade is not a win-win for all. Comparative advantage is
false. Only a 1st year student of classical macro would believe this
nonsense. Through <a href="../../2017/08/economic-complexity-hidalgo.html">recent research</a>
(thanks to physicists barging into economics) we know that what matters is
diversity of products each country produces, not some empty notion of
"trade". "France should specialize on wine, UK on fish and chips". No;
they should both dabble in wine making and fish and chips, in varying
amounts sure, but the know-how for both products needs to exist in
each country. That is how everyone wins.</p>

<p>Question</p>
<p>Why is the Davos label "Fourth Industrial Revolution" a bad name?</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Think of agricultural era</span></p>
<p>When agriculture was industrialized we didn't call it "the Second
Agricultural Revolution". Agro was simply made better but as a way to
arrange social interactions, it lost its importance. We were in a new
age, the Second Wave.</p>

<p>Question</p>
<p>Why was the left associated with anti-religious feeling for so long?</p>
<p><span style="color:red">They chose their enemy</span></p>
<p>In war the greatest luxury has to be choosing your enemy yourself. The
so-called "conservatives" probably honed in on Marx (whose mental
faculties were subpar to say the least) because of his anti-religious
writings. He would be an enemy easier to fight.</p>
<hr />
<p>Question</p>
<p>What sources are best to learn about the teachings of Jesus, Mohammad
[not necessarily the same thing as Christianity or peasant Islam]?</p>
<p><span style="color:red">It is hard</span></p>
<p>For Mohammad, it takes a lot of trawling through his recorded sayings
Hadith, cross checking everything. For Jesus I would look at Gospe of
Thomas. My favorite part is "when you make the two one, and when you
make the outside like the inside, and above like below; when you make
the male and the female as one, then you will enter the kingdom of
God".</p>
<hr />
<p>Question</p>
<p>Do you feel rebellious?</p>
<p><span style="color:red">Not really</span></p>
<p>Sometimes, but I am mostly baffled why people cannot reach the
simplest conclusions indicated by numbers, economics, history. Let's
take religion; A figure who befriended thieves, all kinds of unruly
characters is somehow the symbol of moralistic piousness, and the
mafia-state of the time had nothing to do with his murder?</p>
<p>Is this what Gurdjieff meant when he said 'everyone seems asleep'?</p>
<hr />
<p>Question</p>
<p>Affirmative action works. But what happens when it is applied a black
applicant vs. an Asian applicant? With equal qualifications, should
the black student be preferred?</p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>The legislation was intended for black students; because they need to
battle more discrimination to get there, so the admission process
needs to take that into account and apply reverse-discrimination in
order to achieve the intended effect.</p>
<p>In society the Asians have the exact opposite "problem" in a way, a
form of positive discrimination on one specific area, "oh look at that
Asian kid, he must be smart (US vernacular reserves the word 'smart'
mostly for 'book-smart' as in person cranking through homework
problems). For 1st, 2nd generation immigrants there are other cultural
factors which could also be unfair on the Asian, Indian kids, maybe
they don't want to be this certain way, the "smart" kid, pushed
towards a particular direction. British comedian Sanjeev Bhaskar tells
a story where he is informing his father that he wanted to be an actor
when his father interrupts him and says "son, you mispronounce the
word..  It's pronounced as <em>doctor</em>". The man wasn't joking, he
wouldn't even hear the words, like it didn't register.</p>
<hr />
<p>Question</p>
<p>How far has the integration in United States come? </p>
<p>Depends</p>
<p>The society isn't color blind, non-discriminate, equal in most
places. During college I remember a white femal friend telling us
about her black roommate saying "she watches black shows all the
time", in a near whispering fashion, as if sharing some surprising
information. She didn't have black friends before college, not many
did. Of course her roommate watched black shows, why wouldn't she?</p>
<p>In US high schools it is a known fact that black students cluster, of
course so do goths, white jocks, geeks, etc, ... The surprising place
is Holywood, the liberal, "equality, diversity bastion" of America,
where recently the lead actor Boseman, while talking about his
experiences during filming of <em>Black Panther</em> said, during an
interview "it was black people everywhere, it was so awesome!". So he
was happy being only with black people; This is coming from a guy with
some history in TV, movies, scifi and his first name isn't Tyron,
Tabitha, or Momembe.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be taken as Asians, black, Latinos cluster <em>all the
time</em>. There are always interactivity, but it just ain't the
Federation. Not yet.</p>

<p>Ha ha.. is that Nancy with JFK? </p>
<p>Better watch out.. he'd nail you on the spot if alone in the same room
with him. He did that to this one girl u know. Basically rape. But
hey, little rape here, little hair smelling there.. just a regular
day for a Catholic.</p>
<hr />
<p>Question</p>
<p>What is the biggest con in the world?</p>
<p>Biggest con in the world is the fake news around the death of Jesus
and the coopting of his legacy. Reality: He died because of the
"landed interests" i.e. Rome.</p>
<p>I want to make this point very clear: Italians killed Jesus.</p>
<p>The empire killed him, and by extension the empire's descendent the
Catholic Church. The schism was, and always is, between static,
village-minded landowners (and their many empires) and adaptable, free
wheeling foragers. If not in actuality, in spirit.</p>
<p>What happened after his death...? So when Jesus was killed the
establishment started the dance: he died, but he didn't actually die,
he wasn't killed by us, killed by these other people (for which we'll
take revenge for later, there'll be a guy with a funny mustache, don't
worry, whose soldiers will make the exact same hand gesture as our
soldiers -Ave Ceasar, Heil Hitler-, there'll be a price to pay). They
continue the dance, he died, he didn't die, BUT he was a God, a deity
(but he is dead?), for which you need a way to worship to, <strong>which
we'll provide to you</strong>. The clerical class is born. Pre-Abrahamic
bone-worshipping child sacrificing villager makes a comeback, now
creating a worshipping seance towards a figure whose teachings were
exactly the opposite . Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>This is the biggest con in the world with the most far reaching
consequences. It was genius.</p>
<hr />
<p>Question</p>
<p>Should the CC continue to exist?</p>
<p>Better safe than sorry</p>
<p>I know the new gumba they got in there is trying to fix some stuff,
but, just to be on the safe side, I think everyone's goal should be
<strong>to degrade and ultimately destroy</strong> the Catholic Church. By extension
all related Rome-like cultures need to be "degraded" as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>How are marital relations effected by agrarian era?</p>
<p>When land became important it's inheritence became a huge issue, and
by extension, knowing who your biological children are. The piousness
around marriage, sex become prevalent here. Moralism is not due to the
teachings of prophets, who were, in their time, political
revolutionaries (left) fighting entrenced intrests.</p>
<p>I repeat, piousness predate the prophets.</p>
<p>But there is more: On the one hand there is the moralistic
piousness. On the other, the landowners, now flush with cash who are
hoarding wealth (because they can, wealth is based on land which can
grow), they are also, at least the big ones, hoarding wives, because
again, they can. You can see that "I'am entitled to this" attitude in
sexual matters, like with JFK. Or other Catholics, or many others from
"that part" of the world, culturally speaking.</p>
<p>Look at how Trump, whose thinking is marred by the paisan he grew up
with, being a serial cheater on his wives, including this last
one. Same thing. The current wife, of course, being a good Catholic
forgave him.</p>
<p>The funny anectode here is that Mohammed actually tried <em>reducing</em> the
number of wives men could marry to, trying to sneak in some sense,
saying "you know it's really much better to be with one".  But like
with many other things, "peasant propaganda" won the day. We are
living in the world created by them.</p>
<hr />
<p>Question</p>
<p>How was sexual relations pre-agro?</p>
<p>Normal</p>
<p>There were couples, men and women paid some attention to their child -
why not? I hunt for fish, I hunt for one more and give it to this kid
who kinda looks like me. People did have relations with other partners
sometimes, but noone made a big deal out of it.</p>
<p>I don't want to sugar coat it, men and women were not the <em>same</em> in
all aspects of life, but the inequality between sexes was much less
pronounced than during the agricultural era. During agro, 1st wave,
there were also other weirdness (everything about these people is
bunch of weirdo nonsense), sometimes in place of the male landowner
you can end up with female landowner boss, the <em>hanımağa</em> as it is
called in gobble-gobble (where all this shit started) which is just as
repugnant as the male version.</p>
<hr />
<p>Question</p>
<p>Is entertainment a 1st wave thing?</p>
<p>Mostly</p>
<p>From anthropologist Ian Morris [1]: "Hunter-gatherer bands had had
broad geographical horizons but narrow social ones: the landscape
changed but the faces did not. The early farmer’s world was just the
opposite. You might pass your whole life within a day’s walk of the
village where you were born, but what a place it was—full of shrines
where the gods revealed themselves, festivals and feasts to delight
the senses, and gossipy, nosy neighbors"</p>
<p>Offering art in an enclosed space, you don't leave it, it comes to
you, everything you need in that one cramped place... Sounds a lot
like today, where people shun the environment, nature, but are
entertained by some stupid box in your own room.</p>
<p>But the subconcious is rebeling against this: why is Fortnite the most
popular game today? What do you do in Fortnite? You are outside,
running around, seeking shelter, fighting, trying to survive right?
Isn't that pre-agro forager life?</p>
<hr />
<p>Question</p>
<p>What defines normal?</p>
<p>Good question</p>
<p>Most of our sense of normal is still defined by our hunter-gatherer
days, because we've been that way the longest. The teachings of
prophets (philosophers / politicians) reflect this, and reliable texts
that survive reveal an abhorrence for a particular way of life. Rumi,
a famous Islamic cleric, said "spend a day in a village you won't
recover for a month". He was like "there is some f..d up shit going on
in there, u know wha Im sayin?  It creeps me the f..k
out... Damn!". Well he didn't say that exactly but he meant it.</p>
<p>A lot of comedy is based on the "normal" person from outside village
looking in and telling on what's going on inside. When a comedian
makes fun of people having relations with dogs, having quirks, they
are making fun of the village. How else could you get fat if it wasn't
for a surplus generation of food that's only possible in the agro
area?  Hence the fat jokes. Obsession with sex; again only possible in
an enclosed space where you have no other worries than fuckin.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-388476833/steven-strogatz-how-lies-in-mathematics-reveal-the-truth#t=7:35">here</a> is your moment of Zen...</p>

<p>Bancor requires no anchor; There are a certain group of econs out
there who have an odd infatuation with gold (Keynes despised it,
called it a barbaric relic). The yellow metal is nothing special. We
<em>imbue</em> moneyness on things ourselves, from the beginning of ancient
times (money is created by armies. King deploys soldiers to get slaves
to dig x out of the ground, gives x to the soldiers as minted money,
and taxes ordinary people in x [2]).</p>
<p>Bancor discourages both creditors and debtors, PLUS adjusts the
exchange rate depending on the status of countries, whether on the
plus side, or the minus side of the ledger. In essence what should
have happened through "floating" currency exchanges, happens through
bancor.</p>
