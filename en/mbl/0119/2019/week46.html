<p>Some like SNG (synthetic natural gas) which can be used like NG,
created by mixing H2 with CO2. But SNG is methane just like NG, that
is worrying, for leakage.  I stick to the position where fossil
converted into H2 at the source, then all the way down the line fuel
stays clean. This is the safest choice.</p>

in which Alexander Hamilton, the founding father Democrats had
traditionally associated with the banker-friendly Republican Party and
a self-proclaimed elitist who created Wall Street and distrusted
democracy, had somehow become an icon of progressive thinking and
national greatness. He had become a left-wing political hero, instead
of the traditional enemy of democracy that historians‚Äîand members of
the Democratic Party‚Äîunderstood him as for two hundred years ... Obama
said that enjoying Hamilton was the only thing he and Republican Dick

<p>"Equilibrium thinking in economics has clearly traceable historical
roots. Chapter 1 of Eric Beinhocker‚Äôs book is a wonderful summary of
where it comes from. In short: it comes from equilibrium
thermodynamics ‚Äî the study of gases, liquids, solids, under conditions
where everything is allowed to come to rest. This field developed in
the 19th century when people were interested in steam engines. In
other words, it was all about gases in boxes (steam in cylinders).</p>
<p>Social researchers of the 19th century were impressed by the success
of this branch of science, and also by its similarity to economics. A
gas is a macroscopic thing, characterized by macroscopic properties ‚Äî
temperature, pressure, volume. But it consists of many microscopic
constituents (molecules) whose interactions collectively create the
macroscopic state. The study of macroscopic properties arising from
microscopic interactions is called statistical mechanics. That really
does sound like economics: an economy is a macroscopic thing,
characterized by macroscopic properties such as GDP and trade
balances, and those macroscopic properties arise from myriad
microscopic constituents (people) interacting with each other.</p>
<p>So far so good. I completely agree with the analogy at this level:
economics really is about a lot of microscopic constituents generating
macroscopic behavior. But‚Ä¶ what was done in 19th-century
thermodynamics and statistical mechanics was based on the assumption
that things are well described as being in equilibrium. That is not
the case in economics (we have growth), and a lot of equilibrium
intuition simply doesn‚Äôt apply"</p>

<p>"It is always irritating to me when important researchers say, or
imply, that theory is not important for methods intended to solve real
problems. I could not disagree more. A theorem should say what happens
when a method is applied to a problem when the hypotheses hold. It is
a proof of correctness for the algorithm on the class of problems
satisfying the hypotheses. It is not that the hypotheses should be
checked before the algorithm is used. I will try to make my point with
a simple example: the theory says that a square matrix is positive
definite iff the Cholesky decomposition of that matrix exists. But, we
do not check to see that the matrix is positive definite before
attempting the decomposition. If the decomposition fails, then we
know"</p>

<p>It's true - Bam could be un-American, possibly Indonesian at that
subconcious cultural level. But that's fine - in 2008 many voters
probably <em>wanted</em> someone un-American, bcz there was a string of
screw-ups until than by "Americans".</p>
<p>This also explains the success of Trump's birther attack on him, the

<p>Stoller, <em>Goliath</em></p>
<p>"The high technology of the 1920s‚Äîautomobiles, electric utilities,
chemicals, airplanes, radio‚Äîgenerated massive wealth. But this wealth
wasn‚Äôt really paid out to workers in the form of higher wages. Machine
‚Äãguns in the mines, and a legal framework biased against unions, made
sure of that... And the Mellon [the long-time ultra-cap treasury sec]
tax cuts took away the last mechanism for democratic forces to
structure the political economy; the profits of the decade did not
pass into government hands.  By 1928, the top one percent of the
population received nearly a quarter of all income. This excess income
flooded into the stock market, and into speculation. At the same time,
the Federal Reserve, created by Wilson to give the public control over
banking, was instead controlled by shortsighted private bankers who
could not or would not stop speculative bubbles. It was a dangerously
unstable system" -</p>
<hr />
<p>Book claims Patman inspired, set the stage for what was to follow,
basically FDR's New Deal.</p>
<p>Sounds like he knew his shit - so he was a technocrat. Being technocrat
is not bad - more left technocrats are needed.</p>
<p>"This thirty-nine-year-old radical had an owlish face, an accountant‚Äôs
glasses, and a scrupulously polite demeanor. Yet in picking a fight
with Mellon, he put into the crosshairs the entire old order of
finance-friendly politics that had organized American politics during
most of the years since the 1870s. This conflict would set the stage
for a forty-six-year career in Congress working to constrain the money
lords.</p>
<p>His influence in the Democratic Party was profound. Much of
mid-century banking law bears his stamp, and he used his perch to
launch investigations against banks, foundations, and corrupt
government agencies. Sam Ealy Johnson, Lyndon Johnson‚Äôs father, told
LBJ that when he went to Washington, D.C., as a congressman, if he was
ever unsure of how to vote on a bill, he should follow Patman‚Äôs lead,
as Patman was for the people...</p>
<p>Patman was always fascinated with politics. As a high schooler, his
hobby was reading the Congressional Record, and he would do so even
while plowing fields. ‚ÄúIt will stack up like cordwood if you don‚Äôt use
it right,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut you can use it right, and you‚Äôll get an
education out of it.‚Äù34 While a teenager, he was imbibing the monetary
debates of the early 1900s, the years of Teddy Roosevelt fighting his
first major antitrust case with J. P. Morgan over Northern Securities,
the monetary collapse of 1907 leading to the founding of the Federal
Reserve, and the third presidential campaign of William Jennings
Bryan" -- Stoller, <em>Goliath</em></p>

<p>The biggest anti-American book many read outside US is <em>Shibumi</em>. IMO
it is an indirect criticism of a certain brand of politics and time in
US, overly pro-corp, even fascistic, cartel politics. The sort of
stuff that many thought was buried decades ago, but the post Berlin
Wall "euphoria" and the naivete of Clintons brought it back.</p>
<hr />
<p>Stoller, <em>Goliath</em></p>
<p>"Our world looks very different than it did in the mid-1970s, and not
just because of technological advances. There‚Äôs a sameness to
everything. In 1974, we often shopped at a local store. Today we live
in a world dominated by chain stores, not just in the U.S., and in
many cases with a sameness of experience in most major cities in the
world.</p>
<p>Take a look around. You probably have a phone made by one of two
companies. You likely bank at one of four giant banks, and fly on one
of four big airlines. You connect with friends with either Facebook,
WhatsApp, or Instagram, all of which are owned by one company. You get
your internet through Comcast or AT&amp;T. Data about your thoughts goes
into a database owned by Google, what you buy into Amazon or Walmart,
and what you owe into Experian or Equifax. You live in a world
structured by concentrated corporate power.</p>
<p>This goes far beyond consumer brands. Our increasingly concentrated
and corrupted medical system is literally killing us. As one analyst
put it, ‚Äúdue to medical errors and other forms of harmful care,
contact with the American health-care system is now the third leading
cause of death in the United States.‚Äù. That‚Äôs 10 percent of all
U.S. ‚Äãdeaths. This too can be traced, in part, to
monopolization. Because of a wave of mergers, 40 percent of hospital
stays occur in markets where one entity controls all hospitals, and
these hospitals, like all monopolies, no longer have a strong
incentive to deliver quality care at a reasonable price. Instead,
they sometimes over-treat, and kill, their patients"</p>
