<p>People in CH used WeChat app for payments like mad, some 9 trillion $ were spent through WeChat in 2016; that would be akin to using WhatsApp for payments which currently its users cannot. Why is the financial system so schlerotic when it comes to payments? Even a system like Paypal ended up being another "site" that is in its own silo. It is 2019 and we are hoping some weird, yet unknown private crypto solution to help us. Obviously over-centralized state is good at unifying disparate systems, but still, it feels like there should have been more innovation in this space.</p>

him and when asked 'who did the grand ayatollah meant by that?'
reportedly he deadpanned 'Himself', and ppl laughed. That comes as

<p>Is Japan private debt mosty household debt? No. I checked. Most of the private debt is businesses. </p>

<p>The problem is too much private debt. There was some deleveraging but
not nearly enough. Companies are servicing debt with debt rather than
creating value. BOJ needs to increase rates to, say 5%, watch zombie
companies die, bankruptcies will clear away junk and their debt, so
new companies can borrow and create value. Textbook says with low
growth decrease rates but u r off textbook territory now.</p>
