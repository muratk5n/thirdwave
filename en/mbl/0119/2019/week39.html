<p>Sure, I know a lot of them actually.. my good friend from college, a
Greek guy, is this type. Whenever he goes to a beach, he finds the
nearest small hill, and does a dive from that hilltop into the
sea. It's a thing he always does, now he has his kids do it with
him. So this is in some ways JDINM positive; not overthinking
something, just doing it.</p>
