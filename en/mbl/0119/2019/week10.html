<p>More ultra-capitalist psyop fuckery.. The man "changed". The subtext
is if he made this change <em>somehow</em> before, maybe he would not be
homeless. All it took was putting on the uniform of modernity (any
burgeois clothing would do, hip, or otherwise) and voila, he'd be in.</p>

<p>Increasing spending on existing production will simply increase inflation. In the same vain "give ppl more money to spend" is not an economic argument. It is a social argument, a helping hand to them, not necessarily the economy.</p>
<hr />
<p>That assumes spending increase directly translate into GDP increase. This supposition is false. Increasing credit on the supply side drives growth.</p>

<p>A few days ago we ran a piece in @techreview about some research
purporting to explain the "hipster effect"‚Äîthe fact that
nonconformists often end up nonconforming in the same way. We used a
stock Getty photo of a hipster-ish-looking man.</p>
<p>We promptly got a furious email from a man who said he was the guy in
the photo. He accused us of slandering him, presumably by implying he
was a hipster, and of using the pic without his permission. (He wasn't
too complimentary about the story, either.)</p>
<p>In other words, the guy who'd threatened to sue us for misusing his
image wasn't the one in the photo. He'd misidentified himself.</p>
<p>All of which just proves the story we ran: Hipsters look so much alike
that they can‚Äôt even tell themselves apart from each other. </p>
