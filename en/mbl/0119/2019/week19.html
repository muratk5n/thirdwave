<p>His opening move was not bad; Choosing Charlotesville, race issues, he
made a play for Obama fans among Dems (they say "the base" still likes

<p>Interesting noone thought of using OpenAI Gym CartPole for diff eqn
based solution (ML ppl use it for NN based monkey solutions). The
problem is a very basic one in control theory. Chop chop man... a few
lines of Python would do wonders here.</p>
<hr />
<p>They show cart-pole solution using NN / RL, wout bothering to go into
physics of it - the Lagrangian, optimization.. That's some monkey shit
right there.</p>

<p>Keynes' Bancor idea was supposed to fix balance of trade issues no? Could some1 look into this? </p>
<p>Keynes was no goldcuck, so it was not tied to anything AFAIK.</p>
<p>Him and the Austrians, like Hayek did conflict a lot and I like some of Austrian ideas too. But all were agog with Keynes' brilliance. His math-fu was strong.</p>
<p>A great man, Keynes. I wonder what he'd do with today's tools and data.</p>

<p>How would UBI increase competition? Bcz corps would compete against worker not doing anything. Most wld prefer to do something but UBI raises the bar. </p>
<p>At the same time it lowers it in terms of actual $$ they give. $5/hr now brings worker to minwage levels. Everybody wins.</p>

<p>I have a feeling cheap money might be a way to nudge corps toward full employment (U2) but it only produces shit jobs. If u wanna take these effers down u might wanna hit on that. Shove ur leg in that shit. The head if that's not enough.</p>
<p>Corps are caught btw inno (full automation) and shit jobs; e-z money is enough to do the latter for now, which brings productivity down. Problem is feckless leadership, remove e-z money, let some companies crash, give UBI, move on.</p>

<p>All this money printing but no inflation, why? Another explanation, money went to the rich, who do not (cannot) spend it all on regular items. How many cars can a dozen billionaires buy? So excess money does not circulate, no inflation.</p>
<p>But of course noone wants their wealth to decrease, so it is invested which causes a bubble in the stock market. In Venezuella (a basket case ran by an imbecile) printed money is given to the people who circulate it in the econ which creates hyperinflation.</p>
<p>In the meantime we target full unemployment blocking inno, productivity goes down, creating shit jobs. Inequality gap widens. We need to increase inno, use UBI, fire everyone who are in shit jobs working for a "wage".</p>
<p>USD being the reserve curr is helpful too of course. Foreign countries constantly need dolllars which raises its value.</p>

<p>"1/ Hypothesis: The primary way that techy bicoastal millennials interact with the vast underclass of millions of hourly workers is in Uber cars. Riders talking to drivers. Uber is creating the forum for folks to learn about each other, and what we’re learning disappoints us"</p>
<p>"2/ In turn, this emotion is redirected at the company, when in fact we all need to get smarter about what’s going on in our economy. There are 80 million hourly workers, who don’t have benefits and income security. Their jobs turn over 100%+ annually. They have zero savings."</p>
<p>"10/ It’s something we have to figure out, because the majority of the economy actually looks like this, not just Uber. And as many of you know, automation, robotics, and technology will just accelerate this even further. This is something that needs to get figured out"</p>
<p>"11/ The conversations you’re having in your Uber cars — that’s just the medium. The message is deeper, and more profound: 80 million hourly workers without benefits. $38k in debt. Can’t cover $400 in expenses. 100%+ turnover in their work. Think about that.'</p>
