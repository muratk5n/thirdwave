<p>"Years of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies have left the
world economy overburdened with debt. In the next downturn, much of
that debt will become unserviceable. This should be dealt with now.</p>
<p>For many years, the macroeconomic policies of the major, advanced
countries have been forcing their economies down a dangerous
path. Economic downturns were met with fiscal expansion. Similarly,
monetary policies were eased to induce more private sector borrowing
and more spending. From the perspective of each moment, these policies
seemed eminently sensible. However, in the recoveries that followed,
fiscal and monetary policies were never tightened in an equally
vigorous way.</p>
<p>Looking at the global economy today, there are ample grounds for
concern. Growth has been slowing in most of the major regions, and
profit expectations are declining. Corporate leverage has been rising,
as have worries about the quality of corporate liabilities. In many
markets, equity prices and the prices of high-risk liabilities seem
elevated. In some areas, the price of houses and commercial properties
are at record levels, as indeed are associated debt levels...</p>
<p>[O]ur economies would benefit greatly from more voluntary debt
restructuring by creditors, and the sooner the better. Orderly
solutions are better than disorderly solutions, and half a loaf is
better than no loaf. Moreover, there is a political advantage in
forcing those who have made imprudent loans to pay a price for it. It
would take the sting out of the populist cry that the elite always get
off, while ordinary citizens suffer" -- William White (former CB head
of Canada)</p>

<p>Sure Marx used dialectic but let's not forget Marx "had issues" in the

smash one theory (falsify), and build another (falsiable) theory in
its place. You might pick up some pieces of the broken model here and
there, but you don't usually combine "the finished theory 1" with
"finished theory 2" and come up with "better finished theory number

costs for the 81 utility rates in 20 states are already less than

<p>I can't see what use they'd have for them. IMO early humans had a very
practical existence, embedded in nature, with already lots of stimuli
to keep them busy / entertained, with main goal being to stay
alive. But a villager is surrounded by objects of his creation, in
many ways creates his own entertainment (as well as his food) but then
becomes trapped by these creations. Ancestral relationships get weird
(directly tied to land and survival), you worship weird shit because
you are constanly surrounded by objects and being told stories about
them.  This disease still persists today.</p>
<p>But the subconcious is in open rebellion towards the static existence,
a lot of game shows, movies revolve around being in nature, surviving. </p>
<p>"Why wouldn't the hunter-gatherer become a pagan, worship stuff?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Actually paganism comes <em>after</em> hunter-gathering, and smack in the
middle of settled / village life. This is what these f-kers did.. in
their little villages, worship bones, weird objects, and sacrifice
children while they were tending to their "crops". Religions arrived
to save them from their pitiful existence. We can argue the origins of
these religions, but noone can argue they were an advancement compared
to what these sheeplovers practiced beforehand.</p>
<p>Now some encyclopedic info from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism">Wikipedia</a>: "Paganism is a
term first used in the fourth century by early Christians for people
in the Roman Empire .. Ritual sacrifice was an integral part of
ancient Graeco-Roman religion and was regarded as an indication of
whether a person was pagan or Christian .. Paganism was originally a
pejorative and derogatory term .. implying its inferiority. Paganism
has broadly connoted the 'religion of the peasantry'"</p>
<p>"People living before settled life must be pagans. Sounds barbaric". </p>

<p>"Warm ocean temperatures are one of the key factors that strengthen
hurricane development when overall conditions are conducive for their
formation and growth.</p>
<p>Hurricanes require high humidity, relatively constant winds at
different altitudes, and can occur when surface ocean temperatures
exceed about 79¬∞F (26¬∞C). The rising of warm, moist air from the ocean
helps to power the storm.</p>
<p>Two other factors may also be contributing to the rising intensities
of hurricanes. First, warm air holds more water vapor than cold
air‚Äîand the rising air temperatures since the 1970s have caused the
atmospheric water vapor content to rise as well. This increased
moisture provides additional fuel for hurricanes".</p>

<p>Khan on TV. The key point is "everyone learning at their own
pace". Which means teachers presenting to the whole class idea is now
defunct. The recorded lecture content presents the lecture, not the
teacher.</p>
<p>I'd say at higher grades, do away with teachers completely. Student
takes the self-guided course, only at the end (whenever that is,
completely up to the student) student asks to be graded on pass/fail
<a href="https://muratk3n.github.io/thirdwave/en/2011/02/grading.html">basis</a>. Then
a certifier can be involved (who knows the same content
herself). Simple. Everyone wins, less "teacher" time required, and every
student gets quality. School in poor neighborhood or rich neighborhood
all get the same content.</p>

<p>There might be some truth to streotypical millenial's wanting to
"magically learn stuff, really fast". Things should not be this hard
to teach. We are all failing on ed.</p>
<hr />
<p>First of all, in its current form, it can't.</p>
<p>Second, discovering known physics from data (usually created from
simulations made possible thanks to the known physics of that data) is
not interesting. Physics is not about fitting a model to an
overabundance of data - the regular case with Deep Shit approaches. In
the bleeding edge of phy there are only a few data points. Modeler
will derive and derive and arrive to a result for which maybe a few
data points are available. The check against that should be decisive,
so the theory must be falsifiable. But if it is, that is enough. An
overabundance of data is not necessary. What's needed is imagination,
a good hunch and mad math skillz.</p>
<p>"AI can discover physics from data, even make new advances"</p>
<hr />
<p>Prefering regulation was a mistake. That's one demerit badge to Nader.</p>
<p>"In 1960, the top four firms had brewed 27 percent of the beer; by
1980, the top four firms brewed 67 percent. And economists pointed out
the price of beer had steadily declined.</p>
<p>Consumer advocates like Ralph Nader increasingly took the existence of
large corporations for granted; rather than trying to break companies
apart, they sought to strengthen federal regulation.</p>
<p>The rise of the Japanese economy also began to shift public
debate. Japan treated industrial conglomerates as a source of
strength, not a threat to society and the state. American corporations
argued consolidation was necessary to compete, and some politicians
began to sound sympathetic notes." #appelbaum</p>
<hr />
<p>One merit badge for Nader.</p>
<p>"Nader [in 65] argued accident victims were hurt not by the initial
crash but by the ‚Äúsecond collision‚Äù with the interiors of their own
vehicles. Accidents were inevitable, but injuries could be prevented ‚Äî
and car companies were hardly trying...</p>
<p>Nader‚Äôs attack on the car companies was an attack on the primacy of
markets. He was rejecting the idea that unhappy consumers should
simply buy other products. In the idealized world of economic models,
consumer choice was a sufficient mechanism to force improvements in
the safety of automobiles. In a nation with three big automakers,
where driving had long passed from luxury to necessity for most
people, Nader recognized the need to find another way of forcing
companies to make safer products. He recognized the need for
regulation".  #appelbaum</p>
<hr />
<p>"Throughout this period, American policy makers showed little interest
in the views of economists. When in 1920 the government had the novel
idea of calling an economist to testify in an antitrust case against
U.S. Steel, the Supreme Court mocked the man's 'philosophical
deductions' as an inferior grade of evidence...</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government continued to treat size itself as
un-American. A dominant company might provide the best service at the
lowest price, but economic efficiency was not the goal of public
policy. In 1962, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the Brown
Shoe Company could not buy the G. R. Kinney Company because the deal
would let the combined company sell shoes at lower prices, and that
would place its smaller competitors at a disadvantage" #appelbaum</p>
<hr />
<p>"Meanwhile, the optimists insisted that we must have faith and follow
where the theory led. String theory appeared to do so much that was
required of a unified theory that the rest of the story would surely
reveal itself in time.</p>
<p>In the last several years, however, there has been a complete 
turnaround in how many string theorists think. The long-held hopes for
a unique theory have receded, and many of them now believe that
string theory should be understood as a vast landscape of 
possible theories, each of which governs a different region of a multiple
universe.</p>
<p>What led to this reversal in expectations? Paradoxically, it was a
confrontation with the data. But these were not the data we'd hoped
for ‚Äî they were data that most of us had never expected.</p>
<p>A good theory should surprise us; it means that whoever invented it
was doing their job. But when an observation surprises us, theorists
worry. No observation in the last thirty years has been more upsetting
than the discovery of the dark energy in 1998" -- Smolin</p>
