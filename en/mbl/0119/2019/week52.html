<p>I remember the Kal-ee-fornia recall election run and the Ahnuld
campaign. He probably started out with consultants, slicing and dicing
"issues" (do this, u get 3.4%, do that u get %6, ..., add it up, we
win). I got this inkling bcz at some pt he said something abt the
"Armenian issue", and TR corporate media started shitting their pants,
this is when I heard. It's a good to issue to defend, but seriously,
WTF would Ahnuld know abt the Armenian issue. I bet some consult
weasel fakk said, "do this u get %1.5".</p>
<p>But I think governator later on saw this appr wouldn't work him, he
changed tack. He became ultra-pro green. Now that sells - a
Republican, very green, you stand out. It's an issue you can lead on, so
you look like a stand-up person.</p>
<p>Issues are not important on their own per se, especially when u r the
challenger. They need to contribute to your <em>character</em> which is.</p>

<p>How did I come up with the interval analysis for the "dollar strong"
argument? We hear finance types say such things, dollar is strong,
then weak, etc. I dont believe a single word these f--ers say. Strong?
What does that mean? Relative to what?</p>
<p>Probably some historical average. Weak and strong would then be a
band, based on an interval of historical prices. How to construct such
an interval? Compute mean and standard deviation, mean - stdev, mean +
stdev gives a lower/higher band. About 68% of historical data points
fall here. 2 stdev below and above would get you 95%. If curr price is
closer to upper band, dollar is strong, close to lower, it is weak.</p>
<p>But dont believe me either - when someone says 68%, or 95%, how did
they come up with that? How do we derive it?</p>
<p>If prices are assumed to be normally distributed then we think of the
area around mean (data comes from, falls in that region), between
stdev to the left, and right. If any normal dist can be reduced to
standard normal dist N(0,1), the area is</p>

<p>"[Contains spoilers] Nothing stays put in The Rise of
Skywalker. J. J. Abrams, the director and one of the co-writers, picks
up and ditches intriguing concepts so capriciously that viewers are
left feeling as if they’ve watched someone sneeze on all the items at
a fabulous buffet. This approach—which is “for want of a better word,
completely manic,” my colleague David Sims wrote—is a big part of the
negative critical reaction to the movie. But the wasteful use of
settings, doodads, characters, and space horses does not just exhaust
the audience. It also undermines the most essential prerogative of
Star Wars: world-building.</p>
<p>Lucas’s original trilogy didn’t fret all that much about having a
clever plot. The arc from A New Hope to Return of the Jedi was a
relatively clean and straightforward one about good guys struggling to
overthrow bad ones, with limited detours to explore the consequential
backstory of the main hero and main villain. Upon this sturdy spine,
Lucas and his team draped exquisite set pieces set in interesting
locations. The characters lingered in snow bases and treetop
villages. The journey was absolutely as important as the destination" -- The Atlantic</p>

<p>Something very big happened in the Netherlands recently and it will
have a ripple effect in Courts around the world: The Netherlands’
Supreme Court upheld a ruling ordering the country’s government to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by the end of 2020</p>
<p>The Dutch Supreme Court affirmed that Government's care is directed at
'keeping the country habitable and protecting and improving the
environment',</p>
<p>Even 'if the State itself is not the cause of all Dutch greenhouse gas
emissions',</p>
<p>Even 'if Dutch emissions of greenhouse gases in absolute terms,
compared to global emissions, are very low',</p>
<p>Even 'if the State cannot solve the emissions problem on its own',</p>
<p>... The State should, from its own territory, take measures to the
best of its ability that, together with the efforts of other States,
offer protection against the dangers of serious climate change.</p>
<p>So: The limited partial responsibility of the Dutch State in relation
to the global climate problem does not relieve the State of the duty
of care it bears: The government had explicit duties to protect its
citizens’ human rights in the face of climate change"</p>
