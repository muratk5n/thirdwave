<h1>Week 16</h1>
<p>Fast Company articleEven before students set foot in a classroom, most
schools still are built like factories: long hallways, lined with
metal lockers, transport students to identical, self-contained
classrooms. School designers call these hallways "double-loaded
corridors." The factory model of control and direct instruction still
pervades most new schools. If we are to have thorough-going school
reform, we must change the design model, too, starting with the place
students first enter the school.</p>

<p>Any show that runs for more than 5 seasons deserves attention, and
24, which has blown through this limit some time ago certainly
qualifies. Yes, it is known as a Republican show; we know Dick "Fuck
You, Big Time" Cheney watched it religiously -ahem-, and we know
radical radio show host Rush Limbaugh gave Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe
O'Brian) a full mouth kiss at some kind of Republican tribal gathering
once; Fine. We get it. Conservatives drink this shit like the
Kool-Aid.But as the TIME magazine piece here suggests; 24 isn't all
about gung-ho violence, torture - just another TV conservative
circle-jerk. Sure, it is a show that appeals to a certain crowd, it
asserts, plays with, dances around certain set of culture codes.  As
the main cultural tug of war in US is between prohibition and freedom
(as in letting it go), the main character in 24, Jack Bauer lets it go
a lot. He does not "contain himself", does what is necessary, et
cetera, et cetera. In this way, 24 episodes feel a lot like Tom Clancy
novels, you get the same sort of animosity against press (which surely
has to do with their irrelevance as of late but we'll leave that aside
for the moment), and at the same time skirting along another culture
code for sex, VIOLENCE - making an operator like Bauer so sexy man!
All of this is for emotional, second-level fuck brains obviously (I
don't know karate, but I know ka-raze! You know what I sayin'?). So,
the man (Bauer) both lets go and does violence, breaks the law .. er,
to protect it? OK: What's not to like? Or to criticise?</p>
<p>But, 24 actually manages to say more than this idiotic Clancy
McLiterature McNonsense. Let's ask ourselves: What is another theme
that occurs over and over in 24?You guessed right:Absolute, utter
institutional / bureucratic collapse.Jack Bauer actually is a pretty
fair representation of a fantasy operator who just does the optimal;
ignores the red tape, penetrates buruecratic silos, steps on toes,
crosses boundaries, kicks ass, takes names, and.. just.. does.. not
stop. Mind you, in today's modern, factory style, silo oriented
bureucracies, what he manages to do is no an easy feat: By 8th season,
Bauer knows so many people in all government departments that he is a
government onto himself. There is an attack to CTU (his homebase)? No
problem: He just calls NSA (another agency, silo) to close off some
road to stop a terrorist. FBI, CIA, any three letter agency you can
think of? Been there. Know them. The President? We are buddies! I'll
just call her. Say hello and ask some other thing. Or, I'll ignore
her, if she is getting in my way. As teenagers say nowadays:
What-ever.I am sure everyone watching the show instinctively know in
the back of their minds, that somone like Bauer cannot ever exist. Not
really. Someone like him would have been jailed, killed, neutralized
long ago (er - season one) for any his adventures to ever take
place. No, he is a fantasy, but more than that, Jack Bauer is actually
us. Us, in a first person (shooter?),. video game sense of the
word. Bauer is us, the viewer. The watcher. Through Jack Bauer, we get
to reach across the gap between us and the screen and meddle in the
neferious plots of terrorists, world leaders, as though we are in
control of this huge game. Because actions Bauer takes are absolutely
the same actions an average adult person would take, if s/he were
presented with the information in 24.</p>
