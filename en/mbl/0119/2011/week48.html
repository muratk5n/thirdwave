<p>Debt, First 5000 Years, Graeber: "For most of the Middle Ages, the
economic nerve center of the world economy and the source of its most
dramatic financial innovations was neither China nor India, but the
West, which, from the perspective of the rest of the world, meant the
world of Islam. During most of this period, Christendom, lodged in the
declining empire of Byzantium and the obscure semi-barbarous
principalities of Europe, was largely insig­nificant.</p>
<p>Since people who live in Western Europe have so long been in the habit
of thinking of Islam as the very definition of "the East," it's easy
to forget that, from the perspective of any other great tradi­tion,
the difference between Christianity and Islam is almost
negligible. One need only pick up a book on, say, Medieval Islamic
philosophy to discover disputes between the Baghdad Aristoteleans and
the neo­-Pythagoreans in Basra, or Persian Neo-Platonists-essentially,
scholars doing the same work of trying to square the revealed religion
tradi­tion beginning with Abraham and Moses with the categories of
Greek philosophy, and doing so in a larger context of mercantile
capitalism, universalistic missionary religion, scientific
rationalism, poetic celebra­tions of romantic love, and periodic waves
of fascination with mystical wisdom from the East.</p>
<p>From a world-historical perspective, it seems much more sensible to
see Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as three different manifestations
of the same great Western intellectual tradition, which for most of
human history has centered on Mesopotamia and the Levant, extend­ing
into Europe as far as Greece and into Africa as far as Egypt, and
sometimes farther west across the Mediterranean or down the Nile"</p>
<hr />
<p>Wrong. Average teacher who is only expert at pedagogy should
disappear, researchers record and distribute online videos. This means
replacing teachers (except a few), and is a major change in how
schools are organized. So noone is being "transformed" here -- quality
teachers teach as they did before, but their reach, in terms of
students will now be in millions. On the other hand, average teachers
get zero access.</p>
<p>This is not a slam against regular teachers as individuals. Maybe all
of these people can be stellar educators in a topic they know really
well. But the system is pushing them towards standardized topics,
giving them only basic pedagogy and expect to create wonders on topics
that change faster than the seasons in a year.</p>
<p>I'll give you an example: In mathematics / linear algebra, the topic
of "determinants" used to be a big deal. I mean big. People used to
write books about this shit; that's how big it was. But research
changed direction, all of a sudden that part of math contracted a
little. Now, Gilbert Strang at MIT can reflect that in his video
courses immediately. He knows the research, makes a decision, snap --
millions get the new content. How long would it take for this change
to reach "schools" using the old process? Textbooks, teachers, .. A
long time.</p>
<p>That's why I keep saying, everyone gets first-hand access to quality
content through the Net. No exceptions.</p>
<p>"Instead of replacing teachers, technology has the potential to
transform [..] teaching."</p>
<hr />
<p>Wrong - Access is still problem #1, in US and especially in the
developing world. If a student is willing to learn, the biggest hurdle
they face is access, not lack of pretty animations. These students
should get access to quality content from quality researchers. My
position is "no transformation, only transmission" of teaching, and
the transmission part should be measured in millions, hopefully in an
open-access, open-source form where people vote up and down of content
they like / dislike, and crowdsourcing around such content should be
possible, i.e. providing translations, code examples in different
languages, answers to questions, forums etc. There is amazing
potential here.</p>
<p>From my experience technological solutions work best when they are
based on previous established technologies. Unix is based on C. iPhone
is based on Unix. Apps are based on iPhone. And on and on. There is
nothing wrong with teaching as it has been pursued for centuries. Now
we take that "technology" and scale it up to millions, and willing
kids will suck that in like a sponge. Others.. won't. But I am not
going to waste time to provide "Learn Calculus with Sponge Bob"
animation to such kids who have zero interest in learning such
subjects. You cannot save everyone. But we should provide to everyone
who is willing.</p>
<p>In other words, my focus is on the researcher, whatever they are
willing to part with, I'll take it. I'll drink that shit like it's
Kool-Aid. The infrastructure should be built around such people and it
should only worry about to scaling up their content, period. If said
system can incentivize more people to publish more content, even
better.</p>
<p>"However, [video distribution] efforts continue to fail to make a
positive change in education because each fails to recognize that the
problem lies not the distribution and availability of lectures, but in
lecturing itself [..] [W]hile I agree completely with Khan's
recommendation that instructors move away from the podium and into the
role of coach, there are more and better ways to flip the classroom

<p>Perverse Incentives in Academia</p>
<p>|Incentive|Intended Effect|Actual Effect|
|----------|----------------|--------------|
|Researchers rewarded for increased number of publications.|    Improve research productivity.  |Avalanche of crappy, incremental papers.|
|Researchers rewarded for increased number of citations.|       Researchers do work that is relevant and influential.|       H-index obsession; list of references no longer included in page limit at many conferences.|
|Researchers rewarded for increased grant funding.|     Ensure that research programs are funded, promote growth, generate overhead $$.|        Time wasted writing proposals, inefficient use of public $$.|
|Maximum of two proposals submitted to an NSF program.|     Discourage over-submission. |  You’d have to be crazy to not meet your quota these days.|
|Teachers rewarded for increased student evaluation scores.|    Improved accountability; ensure customer satisfaction.| Easy courses, inflated grades.|
|Teachers rewarded for increased student test scores.|      Improve teacher effectiveness.| Teaching to the tests; emphasis on short-term learning.|
|Departments rewarded for increasing US News ranking.|      Stronger departments.|      Resources squandered trying to influence rankings.|
|Departments rewarded for increasing numbers of BS, MS, and PhD degrees granted.|           Promote efficiency; stop students from being trapped in over-long degree programs; impress the state legislature.|  Class sizes increase; entrance requirements watered down; graduation requirements watered down.|
|Departments rewarded for increasing student credit/contact hours (SCH).|               The university’s teaching mission is fulfilled.|         SCH-maximization games are played: classes are duplicated, turf wars occur over service courses.|</p>

<p>"Lessons from Hamilton</p>
<p>[..] Hamilton — the nation's first Treasury secretary — began pushing
to pay off the Revolutionary War debts of the federal government, as
well as the states. Congress owed its creditors about $54 million, and
the 13 states collectively owed about $25 million, [..]. Creditors
feared the young Congress and states would not be able to pay the
combined $79 million, a staggering sum in those days. [US was] in
worse shape than Greece. This debt threatened to crush the government.</p>
<p>But Hamilton, with the strong backing of President Washington, refused
to consider default. Hamilton consolidated debts and promised that
Congress would raise taxes high enough to pay them off. Persuading
lawmakers to go along wasn't easy. It was very, very tempting to
repudiate the debt to avoid raising taxes.</p>
<p>But Hamilton and Washington insisted. They wanted the United States to
be taken seriously as a grown-up country. They repudiated the idea
that we would be a Third World country. And paying off debt became the
basis of US's success. because investors came to see the United States
as a stable place to do business"</p>

<p>In parallel / sci computing world, I hear words like "x many parallel
solver", "multiblah multishabang .. doer" and whatnot.. This begs the
question: how many computers is enough for a certain problem? A
hundred? A thousand? Or a million?</p>
<p>How'bout infinite computers ?</p>
<p>Has anyone heard of continiuum mechanics? There is a way to prepare
equations -using pure algebra- and once these eqns are setup properly,
you push the entire thing to infinity (using the black art of limits)
then you sit back and watch entire terms cancel out, disappear, as a
result you are left with the simplest formula which can be computed in
linear time. How many computers are needed for this? Zero. We only had
to use our representational, algebraic brain, as a result, we obtain a
shortcut that allows us to bypass hours of computation with a single
statement.</p>

<p>Harvard Entrance Exam 1899</p>
<p><img alt="" src="harvard.png" /></p>
<hr />
<p>"Ever since Johannes Kepler traipsed over half of Europe wooing
aristocratic patrons, scientists have grumbled about money. But their
complaints these days go beyond the familiar griping about being
underpaid and underappreciated. They amount to a powerful case that
the system for funding science is broken—that it hinders scientific
progress and fails to deliver the most bang for the buck. Fixing the
system can no longer be put off.</p>
<p>Most scientists finance their laboratories (and often even their own
salaries) by applying to government agencies and private foundations
for grants. The process has become a major time sink. In 2007 a
U.S. government study found that university faculty members spend
about 40 percent of their research time navigating the bureaucratic
labyrinth, and the situation is no better in Europe [..].</p>
<p>A vicious cycle has developed. With more and more people applying for
each grant, an individual’s chances of winning decrease, so scientists
must submit ever more proposals to stay even. Between 1997 and 2006
the National Science Foundation found that the average applicant had
to submit 30 percent more proposals to garner the same number of
awards. Younger scientists are especially hard-pressed: the success
rate for first-time National Science Foundation applications fell from
22 percent in 2000 to 15 percent in 2006.</p>
<p>Not only does the current system make inefficient use of scientists’
time, it discourages precisely the kind of research that can most
advance our knowledge. Many politicians go so far as to accuse
scientists—particularly in politically contentious areas such as
climate science—of cooking data to win government grants. They have
yet to produce any evidence to support these claims, however. The real
problem is more subtle. Inundated with proposals, agencies tend to
favor worthy but incremental research over risky but potentially
transformative work. Nobelist Mario R. Capecchi and other prominent
scientists say they had trouble getting grants to make their
breakthroughs. In 2009 a New York Times article quoted leading cancer
researchers who said the war on cancer would make more progress if
funders took more risks"</p>

<p>Excellent article. In scifi, ideas matter, and most of these ideas, if
bright enough, do not require much CGI at all. For example in Who
universe there are the "quantum locked" monster / statue beings that
stay put if they are looked at, but move toward their victim when
not. So in order to shoot them the only "camera effect" you will ever
need is between takes someone literally moving the statue. And it's a
brilliant idea, it makes great scifi. It is ideas like these that make
Dr. Who different and as the article suggests, a breath of fresh air
in the scifi land.</p>
<p>Scott Brown: "Bargain-basement BBC production values? Alien monsters
made from trash cans and toilet plungers? Anachronous kibitzing with
Shakespeare and Dickens? That’s my flavor, mate. It’s the sort of
thing that’s hard to find on this side of the pond [..]. I suppose US
culture simply isn’t advanced enough to appreciate the
longest-running, most successful (and, yes, also the cheesiest and
chintziest) science fiction series in television history. And by
advanced, I mean defeated. Luckily, that may be changing [..].</p>
<p>There’s a fix I just don’t get from mainstream American science
fiction, perhaps because of its grinding obsession with the
imperialistic (and its depressive sibling, the dystopic), not to
mention its wearisome push for ever-shinier effects. Like its
not-so-distant cousin American religion, American sci-fi is fixated on
final battles, ultimate judgment (particularly on questions of control
and leadership), and an up-or-down vote on the whole good/evil
issue. Even the most morally restless imaginings — the Losts and
Battlestars — eventually prolapse into Bruckheimer-esque excerpts from
the Book of Revelation. As an antidote, I turn to the Doctor — a fussy
900-year-old neurotic who’s part Ancient Mariner, part Oxford don,
with a whimsical fashion sense, a close acquaintance with defeat and
futility, and a tendency to rattle on. He subscribes to no Force-like
creed. No enlightened military Federation stands behind him, photon
torpedoes at the ready — indeed, his race, the Time Lords, is more or
less extinct. His signature gizmo isn’t a blaster or a phaser but a
souped-up screwdriver. His Millennium Falcon? The Tardis, which looks
to the unschooled like an old telephone booth. It’s actually a police
call box, a relic from the ’50s, and the ship’s most spectacular
feature isn’t artillery; it’s feng shui: It’s bigger on the inside.The
Doctor is courageous and heroic, sure, but in the Mèdecins Sans
Frontiéres vein. Oh so Euro! [..]</p>
<p>Sound familiar, America? [..] Fair enough: Enjoy your Transformers and
the baby-faced club kids of the new Enterprise. But I’d highly
recommend a field trip to Whoville."</p>

<p>Death Knell for the Lecture</p>
<p>Daphne Koller: "Our education system is in a state of crisis. [..] As
a society, we can and should invest more money in education. But that
is only part of the solution. [..] We need to significantly reduce
those costs while at the same time improving quality [..].</p>
<p>How can we improve performance in education, while cutting costs at
the same time? In 1984, Benjamin Bloom showed that individual tutoring
had a huge advantage over standard lecture environments: The average
tutored student performed better than 98 percent of the students in
the standard class.</p>
<p>Until now, it has been hard to see how to make individualized
education affordable. But I argue that technology may provide a path
to this goal [..].</p>
<p>At Stanford, we recently placed three computer science courses online,
using a similar format. Remarkably, in the first four weeks, 300,000
students registered for these courses, with millions of video views
and hundreds of thousands of submitted assignments.</p>
<p>What can we learn from these successes? First, we see that video
content is engaging to students — many of whom grew up on YouTube —
and easy for instructors to produce"</p>

<p>Creeping Fascism</p>
<p>"Among other provisions that seek to control the sharing of copyrighted
material on the Internet, SOPA, if enacted, would call upon the
U.S. government to require that Internet service providers remove from
their DNS servers the names of any sites that either infringe
copyright directly or merely “facilitate” copyright infringement. So,
for example, the government could require that ISPs remove the name
“twitter.com” from their DNS servers if twitter.com was not being
sufficiently aggressive in preventing its users from tweeting
information about places to download copyrighted materials. This
practice is known as DNS filtering. DNS filtering is one of the most
common modes of Internet-based censorship. As we and our collaborators
in the OpenNet Initiative have shown over the past decade, practices
of this sort are used extensively in autocratic countries, including
China and Iran, to prevent access to a range of sites offensive to the
governments of those countries."</p>
<hr />
<p>"As I was getting an article ready for final publication through the
journal publisher website, I was given the option of offering the
article as “Open Access”: I acknowledge that publishing my article
with open access costs €2000 / US $3000 and that this choice is final
and cannot be cancelled later.  Whoa. First, any normal publishing
industry pays the authors! Second, as the person who authored the work
(and is giving it away for free) I am quite frankly appalled by the
fact that I would be paying a large sum for free distribution. Sure, I
have no beef with a for-profit firm providing a service for a fee, but
the crazy price indicates that they are exploiting a monopoly that we
have voluntarily given them. In a world with cheap self-publishing
alternatives, this is not tolerable. Until we actively come up with an
alternative, publishers will continue these extreme pricing practices"</p>

<p>BTW, this book is all about the accomplishments of Germans in history
which the author thinks are widely underrated. I found this passage
interesting because it points out how opposite Hitler was to all that,
while at the same time, using all these accomplishments for his
propaganda.</p>
<p>The German Genius, Peter Watson, pg. 620: "During the Weimer years [in
Germany..] there was a continual battle between the rationalists -the
scientists and the academics- and the nationalists, the pan-Germans,
who remained convinced there was something special about Germany, her
history, the "instinctive superiority" of her heroes. In The Decline
of the West, Oswald Spengler had stressed how Germany was different
from France, the US, and Britain, and this view [..] gained ground
among Nazis as they edged closer to power. From time to time Hitler
attacked modern art [..] but, like other leading Nazis, he was by
temperament an anti-intellectual; for him, most great men of history
had been doers, not thinkers"</p>
