<p>The Advanced Clean Energy Storage project in Utah aims to build the

partly by putting hydrogen into underground salt caverns. The concept
is quickly gaining momentum in Europe.</p>
<p>Some 130 miles south of Salt Lake City, engineers are working on what
will become a giant cavity in the ground. It’s a geological formation

<p>"We then attempted to replicate these observations with a quick SPH
simulation. The flow field in the simulations and the experiment are
in satisfying agreement. The matching flow patterns indicate that the
fluid dynamics at the higher speeds are reproduced with certainty as
well"</p>

<p>They can increase renewable use through solar, they certainly have a
lot of direct sunshine.</p>
<p>Min says solar generation is done for 6 hours, 1/4th of a day -same
guesstimate I'd used earlier-. For renewable storage; <a href="../../2019/07/gencell.md">GenCell</a>
is local right?</p>

<p>@JRubinBlogger with all due respect, this is a terrible piece. Ky
Democrats have run 6 moderate candidates in a row against McConnell,
each less inspiring than the previous &amp; losing every time. @Booker4KY
is inspiring &amp; genuine. Unless @AmyMcGrathKY can become both, it’s a
loss.</p>

<p>Fossil energy companies can win in a renewable fuel economy (there
wont be a 'battery economy' as the amount of lithium reserves are
limited). But many companies have the know-how to transport, process
chemical fuels, they only have to adapt to a somewhat different type
of fuel. A win-win for all.</p>

<p>Guess what, Japan is <a href="https://youtu.be/5ejL65tKsGM?t=107">ready</a> for that shit. </p>
<p>"Saudi Aramco, the world's biggest oil producer, last month shipped the
world's first shipment of "blue" ammonia – produced using hydrogen
derived from fossil fuels and capturing the carbon emissions – to
Japan, to be used in zero-carbon power generation"</p>
