Summary: voltage fluctuate in that case across households -/+ less
amps required within same wattage gives different voltage, since $p =
iv$, and that is okay within a certain window.</p>
<p>Dude said "power used is proportional to voltage squared" which is true. </p>

v = Ri, \quad p = vi = v \left[ \frac{v}{R} \right] =
\frac{v^2}{R}

<p>Additionally there are ppl running the generators who try to predict
demand on hourly basis so they run turbines on a schedule to generate
energy at acceptable levels.</p>
<p>But IMO gas / pipeline based grids wld be able to regulate themselves
much better. Hell individual homes could store excess H2 energy on
their own in huge amts if they wanted to.</p>

<p>Gas based tranmission is crazy efficient. Let's replace electricity
grid with gas grid.</p>
<p>"Transport of H2 by pipeline exploits the high energy transmission
capacity of H2 (4 to 5 times that of electricity using HVDC
(respectively 27 and 6 GWh/h) and of the same order of natural gas (38
GWh/h)). This high transmission capacity is of particular advantage
for H2 production from RES considering that many of these sources are
far from the major load centres"</p>

multiply the two you get ~ 210 kWh. 100 vs 210. FC got you beat

worse, if the bat doesn't lose half its capacity before that due to

<p>Summary, the issue is private debt</p>
<p>The Great Stagnation, Plantenberg: "With interest rates hitting zero,
the Bank of Japan's only way to induce money growth [was] to keep
printing money. But the BOJ has already bought government bonds, and
thus created money, on a large scale. The monetary base has increased
at an annual rate of almost 25 percent over the two years to 2003
.. Yet this has not led to higher growth in broad money. Instead, bank
lending has continued to fall. Banks are reluctant to lend, as they
are already piled up with bad loans, a problem that is only slowly
being overcome. Moreover indebted firms are unwilling to borrow as
long as the deflation environment persists."</p>

<p>Awwww shiit. Rogoff slapped down.</p>
<p>Plantenberg, <em>Accounting for current account changes</em>: "With the
current account balance being one of the most important variables of
an open economy, one should expect that its economic determinants are
well understood. Yet, as this paper seeks to demonstrate, this is not
the case. This paper focuses on the most influential theory of the
current account balance, the so-called intertemporal approach to the
current account, and provides empirical evidence that undermines the
theory’s main idea.</p>
<p>The intertemporal approach is an old theory that was popularized in
the 1980s and 1990s. The third volume of the Handbook of International
Economics edited by Grossman and Rogoff (1995) dedicates a whole
chapter to it (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1995). And at least since the
publication of the authoritative macroeconomics textbook by Obstfeld
and Rogoff (1996), every graduate student attending international
economics classes will have heard of it.</p>
<p>The main idea of the theory is easily conveyed....  Under the
simplifying assumption that domestic agents hold only foreign assets,
this implies that countries with temporarily high incomes will run
current account surpluses and that countries with temporarily low
incomes will run current account deficits.  .. What this paper does is
that it measures across countries to what extent the changes in the
current account are accounted for by changes in national income and
national expenditure, respectively. It then shows that current account
changes do not primarily come about through changes in national
income—as the intertemporal approach would predict—, but instead
through changes in national expenditure"</p>

they could explain atomic spectra!</p>
<p>For a while, in the late 1800s, you could get a job at a British
university studying vortex atoms.  The subject was never very popular

<p>The models got more complex, and nobody ever succeeded in matching the
properties of actual atoms.</p>
<p>Eventually Kelvin gave up on vortex atoms... but didn't admit it

<p>"Why didn't we see the ills of globalization before?". It started as a
way to spread US hegemony, to strengthen China against Russia, and
then it fed on itself - ppl, orgs formed around it who benefited from
this preferential system. After a while ppl forgot how it started. Who
would research its basis? People like Thomas Friedman are too fucking
stupid to question those assumptions. This is the guy who will write
the narrative for you after the fact, within the existing bubble /
reality. He doesnt have the necessary constitution to dig any
deeper. Same for most of the Washington think-tank crowd. The ones who
could, had the skills somehow stayed out, I guess again bcz of inertia.</p>

<p>Their results were questionable, and here's <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/wfithian/status/1252692357788479488">a
passage</a>
from a commenter that is really maddening,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[@wfithian] I am alarmed at their sloppy behavior. The confidence
interval calculation in their preprint made demonstrable math errors,
*not* just questionable methodological choices...</p>
<p>I can't redo the whole calculation myself because parts were not
described anywhere, but I have low confidence that those parts were
done correctly; if not, the corrected confidence interval for
prevalence in Santa Clara County might well stretch all the way to
include zero.</p>
<p>The authors said by email that they used a built-in Stata function and
aren't sure themselves how the software used the input weights. I
suspect they misapplied that function"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mot..f..ka; used "a built-in Stata function"? What is this, the dark
ages? The software used is shit (and closed-source), duplication is
shit. And they dont even have their code available which uses the
closed-source shit.</p>
<p>What is going on here is serious mentality and toolkit fail. Akin to
still using Cobol in that gov office to process unemployment claims,
and a prevalent lack of slickness in using modern tools.</p>

<p>He doesn't report his model success, the $R^2$. He did not share code

there wasn't any follow-up.</p>
<p>"According to Professor Luc Montagnier, winner of the Nobel Prize for
Medicine in 2008 for discovering HIV as the cause of the AIDS epidemic
together with Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, the SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that
was manipulated and accidentally released from a laboratory in Wuhan,
China, in the last quarter of 2019. According to Professor Montagnier,
this laboratory, known for its work on coronaviruses, tried to use one
of these viruses as a vector for HIV in the search for an AIDS
vaccine!</p>
<p>'With my colleague, bio-mathematician Jean-Claude Perez, we carefully
analyzed the description of the genome of this RNA virus,' explains
Luc Montagnier, interviewed by Dr Jean-François Lemoine for the daily
podcast at Pourquoi Docteur, adding that others have already explored
this avenue: Indian researchers have already tried to publish the
results of the analyses that showed that this coronavirus genome
contained sequences of another virus, … the HIV virus (AIDS virus),
but they were forced to withdraw their findings as the pressure from
the mainstream was too great"</p>

<p><em>Japan's Economic Dilemna</em>, Gao (on Japan's bubble, and following stagnation)</p>
<p>"The dilemma in Japanese corporate governance between, on the one hand,
strong coordination and, on the other hand, weak control and
monitoring provided the causal mechanism that led to excessive
competition, a phenomenon that was critical both to Japan’s high
growth and to the bubble. ...  “Control” refers to the control of
shareholders over management due to the separation between ownership
and management (Kester 1997), and “monitoring” refers to the
mechanisms established by banks for 'assessing the credit-worthiness
of proposed projects; tracking the use of funds; distinguishing misuse
from temporary bad luck and correcting it; as well as credible
commitment to penalizing misuse as a safeguard against future misuse'...</p>
<p>Strong coordination was achieved, however, at the cost of deliberately
weakening shareholder control over management and weakening banks’
monitoring over corporations at the micro level (Kester 1997; Miyazaki
1963; Morozumi 1963a). Protected by the state, private corporations
and banks reduced their transaction costs through indirect financing,
through the use of the main bank system, and through business group
and reciprocal shareholding.</p>
<p>Sustained by the permanent employment system practiced by big
corporations and by multidimensional integration within business
groups, strong coordination led not to a socialist, planned economy
but rather to excessive competition among Japanese corporations in
investing in production capacity and technological transfers. This
excessive competition, in turn, triggered the high growth. After the
First Oil Shock, in contrast, banks’ monitoring further deteriorated
as corporations began to build financial independence, separating
themselves from the main banks. In the liberalization of finance,
banks’ leverage over corporations was weakened because corporations
began to raise capital through equity finance and zai’tech (financial
technology). After the Plaza Accord, moreover, the mishandling of
international demand resulted in not only an oversupply of money but
also the adoption of an expansionary fiscal policy that shifted the
incentive structure of private investments from production to the
stock and real estate markets. When the state policies served to
significantly increase investment risks, the weak control and
monitoring that characterized Japanese corporate governance
contributed directly to the rise of the bubble"</p>
