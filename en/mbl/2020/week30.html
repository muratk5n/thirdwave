<p>So the electric grid is 40% efficient (reducing the overall efficiency
of BEVs, 60% x 40% gives 24%, making it closer to a fossil fuel
powered car). One might ask, how efficient is a gas pipeline? It's
over 97%. Loss in that scenario is a bug, not a feature, you plug the
leaks once found, the normal operation you send molecule from one end,
you expect to receive it on the other. The H2 pipelines, when
finished, will have the same characteristics.</p>

<p>51 years ago America landed on the moon. Now we‚Äôre not even allowed in
the fucking Bahamas"</p>
<hr />
<p>The moral of the story is existing parties, cover all bases, help as
much as possible bcz if all fails, then you get national socialism.</p>
<hr />
<p>I am not saying Trump is Hitler</p>
<hr />
<p>Here's how it works; shit goes bad. Existing structures fail to help.
New leaders rise to fill the void, run the gamut around left and
right, left bcz ppl need it, but ultimately the nationalist part which
is incompatible spills over its borders, war ensues.</p>
<p>Nationalists do not use the L word bcz during 40s it is associated
with internationalism, or [shudder], Jews! It's not used now, but they
blow smoke up your ass with the word "populism" bcz Reaganism has been
banging on the other word decades.</p>
<p>But action speaks louder than words. Trump did promise not to touch
social security, Medicare, and promised to end wars during the 2016
campaign.</p>

<p>"Fascism developed the Italian social security system, aimed at a
comprehensive restructuring of the relationships between factors of
production in a 'corporatist' fashion, and nationalized banks and
businesses. The second feature of the regime did not survive its end
(though one may argue that its legacy has long impacted the Italian
economy). But some version of social security and nationalized banks
and companies did"</p>

<p>From <em>Hitler's True Believers</em>, "Insofar as Hitler had fixed ideas at
the end of the Great War in 1918, high on the list was nationalism, in
spite of the aspersions cast against it by mutinous sailors and
rebellious soldiers tired of the fighting. Some aspects of what became
his doctrine or ideology stemmed from the cluster of ideas,
resentments, and passions widely shared in Germany at that time. His
views and those of his comrades also reflected the fact that Germany
was already a nation with a great deal of egalitarianism baked into
its political culture.  Almost without exception, the Nazis emphasized
all kinds of socialist attitudes, to be sure a socialism 'cleansed' of
international Marxism and communism. Indeed, when he looked back from
1941, Hitler said of the NSDAP in the 1920s that '90 ninety percent of
it was made up by left-wing people.' He also thought it was 'decisive'
that he had recognized early in his career that solving the social
question was essential, and he insisted that he hated the closed world
in which he grew up, where social origins determined a person‚Äôs
chances in life.</p>
<p>That Germany on the eve of Hitler‚Äôs appointment as chancellor in
January 1933 continued to have a socialist-oriented political culture
can be illustrated by pointing to the last free elections of the
Weimar Republic the previous November. No less than 71.6 percent of
the vote went to parties with 'socialist' or 'communist' in their
titles"</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes yes.. I know all the twists and turns of that polemic... But the
fact remains, fascists did enact left policies sometimes. It should
not be surprising, they are trying to help people! (then organize them
to kill others, but that's later).</p>
<p>"But that's an old debate, later conservatives said 'look Nazis were
also socialist to bash the left"</p>
<hr />
<p>Yes. By a party who called itself <strong>Na</strong>tionalso<strong>zi</strong>alistisch.
National socialists of Germany.</p>
<p>"Right adapts left politics too, you said, but does not refer to it
excessively. Did this happen in history before?"</p>
<hr />
<p>"The biophysicist Jeremy England made waves in 2013 with a new theory
that cast the origin of life as an inevitable outcome of
thermodynamics. His equations suggested that under certain conditions,
groups of atoms will naturally restructure themselves so as to burn
more and more energy, facilitating the incessant dispersal of energy
and the rise of 'entropy' or disorder in the universe. England said
this restructuring effect, which he calls dissipation-driven
adaptation, fosters the growth of complex structures, including living
things. The existence of life is no mystery or lucky break, he told
Quanta in 2014, but rather follows from general physical principles
and ‚Äúshould be as unsurprising as rocks rolling downhill.'"</p>

<p>"While a resurgence in coronavirus cases in Texas has brought many
businesses to a screeching halt, eight robots have kept All Axis
Machining's metal fabrication facility in Dallas humming.</p>
<p>The small, nimble robots perform multiple jobs, such as
machine-tending, sanding, deburring, part inspection and laser
marking, leaving owner Gary Kuzmin far less dependent on manual
labor. When all the workers on one shift went into self-quarantine
last month, it had no impact on the facility's productivity"</p>

<p>An energy corridor will run from Africa to the EU rather than Russia
to EU? It'll get Africa money, richer continent will not migrate, EU
gets its energy, dependency on RU reduced.</p>
