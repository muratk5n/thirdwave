<p>Tired of "apps", "web sites", or even "platforms"; the next big thing

<hr />
<p>"In recent decades, corporations have taken over the internet with
proprietary networks that provide access in exchange for the loss of
privacy and ownership. The result has been an extractive data economy
that primarily serves a handful of tech giants to the detriment of
competition and innovation — and which is ripe for an intervention.</p>
<p>What might it mean to reboot the internet and make it open again?
Advancements in the decentralized web such as the Internet Computer ..
can put control and ownership of networks back into the hands of the
public. ...</p>
<p>'Platform risk is this concept that, if you’re an entrepreneur or an
investor in startups, there is a huge existential risk that looms over
all software development, essentially, is that at some point if you’re
successful, the big guy that you’re dependent on will come and extract
rents,' remarked Dixon. 'And in some cases much worse.'</p>
<p>'Like in the case of Zynga,' he went on, 'Facebook just changed all
the rules. It just destroyed the economics. Twitter changed their API
that just literally killed off overnight a huge swath of startups,
like Twitter clients and things that depend on the API.'"</p>

empires failing helped. So EU should thank the Brits?</p>

Europeans to unite, but in the end it came down to a simple feature of
geography: the English Channel. First the Spanish, then the French,
and finally the Germans managed to dominate the European continent,
but none of them could cross the Channel. Because noone could defeat
Britain, conqueror after conqueror failed to hold Europe as a whole".</p>

<p>I like he focuses to fix one thing, not trying to do the grand
approach; gravity and Einstein's take on it was always odd, doesn't
fit everything else, so he is trying to fix that, using information,
entropy and "emergent gravity". Maxwell combined electricity and
magnetism. He wasn't trying to do a grand theory of everything, just a
theory of .. two things.</p>
<p>Verlinde: "[On the theory of everything] I think it's already
surprising that we've come come this far as humans to understand our
the universe around us, but it's partly to do with the fact that we
are very good at making things abstract in equations that we can
handle, but in doing so we ignore a lot of information. I think we're
smart but I don't think we're infinitely smart, so for me the idea
that we can have a theory of everything, that really explains
everything, is sort of hubris"</p>

efficiency to the entire process.</p>

area = 100*100 * 1e6
energy = 24 * 1000 * area * eff / 1e3 # kWh
