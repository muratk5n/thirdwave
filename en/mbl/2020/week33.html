<p>Kelager: "The fluid is constrained to stay with the grid. It simply
cannot exist outside the grid domain, and thus makes it a difficult
problem to let the fluid flow naturally, e.g. when a fluid container
fractures"</p>
<hr />
<p>Kelager: "The Navier-Stokes equations .. formulate the motion of an
Eulerian fluid"</p>
<hr />
<p>.. and the Eulerian vpoint means that a person "likes to watch"? 😶</p>
<hr />
<p>Lagrangian viewpoint -- does that make a person French minded?</p>
<hr />
<p>SPH (for fluid simulation) uses the Lagrangian viewpoint which
simulates / follows the physics of particles. I guess this viewpoint
comes more natural to me bcz of software background; thinking of
particles that are simulated make more sense than "the Eularian
viewpoint", thinking a predefined grid that doens't change and u watch
the fluid passing through. In either case number of particles / grid
size defines the precision of the calculation, but IMO Lagrangian
viewpoint can get better precision, especially in edge cases.</p>

almost entirely built on 'reality', 'live' and 'free' content. Which
is to say, Redstone's genius was finding a way to pipe content made

<p>"On an otherwise slow news day for fuel cell stocks, Plug Power shook
up the market with an announcement that U.K.-based supermarket chain
Asda will be buying a "turnkey solution" for its warehouse forklift
fleet, including 'fuel cells, hydrogen fueling equipment, hydrogen and
service' from Plug"</p>

<p>When you are in 'Nam and Charlie is coming at you from all directions,
you need to conserve your ammo. You don't shoot until you see the
whites of their eyes. Very important. Charlie is smart. He'll come at
you but stop at a distance, right outside rifle range, he wants you to
shoot and waste your ammo. So you wait... You hold! UNTIL YOU SEE THE
WHITES OF THEIR EYES. Only then you shoot.</p>

<p>Good going Vietnam</p>
<p>"@wang_seaver</p>
<p>Yes, yes New Zealand is doing great on COVID.</p>
<p>But perhaps we can also spare some praise for, say, Vietnam? Vietnam
maintained a 99-day streak without community transmission of COVID-19,
and it has 19.5x the population, 15x the population density, and
1/15th the GDP/capita of NZ"</p>

<p>Luo Huining, aka The Butcher of Tibet, was sanctioned with Carrie
Lam(b) by the United States yesterday. He and his family may no longer
travel, own property, or show their faces in the US. He should be
brought up on war crimes charges for his actions In Tibet. The
belligerence of china’s wolf propagandists continues to bring comedy
to diplomacy. Did they think there wouldn’t be consequences to the
abrogation of their contract with the US and the UK? Communism’s rise
will be met with crippling sanctions that will subdue...</p>
<p>The economic growth and prosperity that existed under a democracy that
was governed under English law. We have the upper hand as the world
doesn’t trust china or its Monopoly money and closed capital

<p>China at least partially blocks Whatsapp Telegram FB Messenger,
Instagram Twitter, Skype etc so basically all conversations with
people in China are concentrated on WeChat, mostly out of convenience
but also by government mandate. Conversely it now becomes an Achilles
heel"</p>

<p>Movie idea, ppl leave Earth in spaceship ready to settle, escaping
apocalyptic scenario, land on Mars and then they are like 'dude it
sucks here let's go back', and they return, use all the tools on
Earth. So it's a very roundbout style of scifi. Indirect.</p>
