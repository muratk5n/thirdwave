<p>The Atlantic: "Even before the coronavirus outbreak, many on the
‚Äúpopulist,‚Äù or ‚Äúradical,‚Äù left insisted that globalization, climate
change, automation, and inequality were creating the conditions for
their own political resurgence, despite their leaders‚ÄîBernie Sanders
in the United States, Jeremy Corbyn in Britain‚Äîbeing rejected at the
ballot box. Now, in a world where governments are nationalizing wages
and public services just to keep their economies afloat, such claims
no longer seem far-fetched. Indeed, Corbyn, who will be replaced as
Labour leader today, said the emergency economic measures being taken
in Britain have proved him 'absolutely right'"</p>

<p>"German scientist Olfert Landt was already on alert. For 30 years, he
had worked on diagnosing emerging diseases, including Severe acute
respiratory syndrome (SARS). He wanted to make a test kit to help
doctors diagnose the disease -- and he wanted to do it fast.
Virologists usually wait until the genetic material of a new virus is
sequenced to start working on a test. This time, Landt and his
30-strong company TIB Molbiol got started early. By January 9 they had
designed their first test kit using SARS and other known coronaviruses
as references. Along with scientists from a local university hospital,
he designed three kits, meaning once the sequence was published, they
could pick the one that worked best..</p>
<p>In Hong Kong [... another scientist] Poon waited for the sequence.</p>
<p>All forms of life have a type of molecule that carries their genetic
instructions. In humans, and most life forms, that's DNA -- the
genetic material that tells us to grow two legs and walk upright...
But it wasn't until January 11, that the sequenced genome was posted
on open-source site virological.org on behalf of Zhang Yongzhen, a
professor from Shanghai's Fudan University. Chinese authorities shared
the sequence on January 12.</p>
<p>Once Zhang shared the sequence, Poon's team started work... Next, they

<p>Massie was flamed by Kerry. They have history apparently. From Wiki</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On April 10, 2019, Massie got in a tense exchange with Former
Secretary of State John Kerry during Kerry's testimony to the House
Oversight and Reform Committee when Massie called Kerry's political
science degree from Yale University a "pseudoscience degree" and
called Kerry's position on climate change "pseudoscience." Kerry
responded, "Are you serious? I mean this is really a serious happening
here?"</p>

<p>Is this correct? To simplify matters I'd just send the money to
everyone. Sure rich ppl would get it too but there arent that many of
them anyway (isnt that part of the problem to begin with?) so no harm
done. Hell even some of the rich can end up poor after recent changes
in the markets maybe they'd need that check soon! Wouldnt that be
something?</p>
