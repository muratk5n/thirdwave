<p>"The lack of options marketed to consumers has created a missing
middle: the zone between mass market and niche market where
experimentation is supposed to proliferate and engender
variety. Worse, the consolidation of the country’s vast creative
sector into fewer, more powerful production and publishing companies
has come at the direct expense of the quality of their product. The
coronavirus isn’t the reason <em>Tenet</em> sucked, for example. It just
sucked because Christopher Nolan has too much power, and very few
other people in his industry have enough.</p>
<p>This homogenization of the arts is a refutation of the idea that
capitalism produces true competition. Instead, we are entering a peak
era of market monopolies, where a group of huge corporations, many of
which trade in personal data, also have a stranglehold grip around the
neck of every non-megastar artist in the country"</p>

<p>People who grow up in a place, from a very young age, get its culture
codes automagically by osmosis (embedded in the second-level emotional

little.</p>
<p>People might try to posture, "represent" around origin, perhaps as a
