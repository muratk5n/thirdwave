<p>Hey Michael Irby from The Unit. Good actor.</p>
<p>#TheExpanse</p>

<p>Expanse is at its best when it is showing off all that cool
tech... The horizontal / vertical elevator was awesome. It goes
reeally fast than all of a sudden goes vertical? Sweet.</p>
<hr />
<p>My alma-mater prided itself for being an engineering school with a
strong humanity bent. You had to take lots of classes from humanities,
which all students playfully called Hum. Hummmm... which bothered some
Hum teachers, one used to tease us for the use of the word. "Are you
happy with your Hummmm?".</p>
<p>Well anyway, one of my Hum classes was changes tech causes on
society. The Internet had not made it to the textbooks yet, but the
so-called client-server IT had been in use for a while, like the
"groupware" Lotus Notes, and they could analyze some of
that. Groupware lets you schedule meetings, etc obviously. You could
see everyone's schedule, and schedule meeting accordingly. I'll never
forget one case where an exec would preemptively block out almost all
spots in his calendar, bcz he didnt want people to schedule meetings
with him, willy nilly.</p>
<p>You see, the introduction of tech in this picture didnt really change
anything. People fought it, and it did not create "a new way of
working" either... This was a good lesson. I guess I was already on
the way of writing this dinky stuff I write today.. 3W tech can
disturb, and may not alter "everything" wout correct social
infrastructure.</p>

<p>"The cost of X fuel, Y fuel" is not a good way to argue for or against
any energy solution. If something is feasible engineering-wise, you
can <em>make</em> it affordable. Is oil cheap to produce? Its companies
received trillions in subsidies in the past that made this fuel
possible. Tech is subsidized, you are paying locals, you are paying to
CIA to stir shit up in the region so u can get oil.... All bcz powers
that be wanted this fuel be possible, and it became
possible. Obviously engineering, chemical-wise it had certain
properties that made it optimal. That is the starting point.</p>

<p>A summary of developments in math, CS; 2020 was a great year for these

<p>"[R]esearchers have designed and synthesized an effective material for
speeding up one of the  limiting steps in extracting hydrogen from
alcohols. The material, a catalyst, is made from tiny clusters of
nickel metal anchored on a 2D substrate. The team led by researchers
at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's (Berkeley Lab) Molecular
Foundry found that the catalyst could cleanly and efficiently
accelerate the reaction that removes hydrogen atoms from a liquid
chemical carrier. The material is robust and made from earth-abundant
metals rather than existing options made from precious metals, and
will help make hydrogen a viable energy source for a wide range of
applications"</p>

<p>I have a feeling the Jews from America who "returned" have a lot to do
with that settlement activity bcz as Americans they are playing
Cowboys and Indians with the locals (some of whose ancestors were
probably true ancient Jews from the region) and have a frontier
mentality. They had their PM in Netan who speaka Americanese (better
than his Hebrew apparently)</p>
<hr />
<p>I want Israel to exist of course.. the arrivees were mostly European
and they have lots to give to the region, in terms of science, work
habits etc.</p>
<hr />
<p>My favorite part from Pappe is <a href="2020/06/10-myths-israel.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The myth insists that the Jews who arrived in 1882 were the
descendants of the Jews expelled by the Romans around 70 CE. The
counterargument questions this genealogical connection. Quite a hefty
scholarly effort has shown that the Jews of Roman Palestine remained
on the land and were first converted to Christianity and then to
Islam</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Jews who "came back" to Israel are not the people "who left"?</p>
<p>And actually there was no leaving? Bloody hell.. But then who the hell
are all these Jews who are "coming back" to Israel? They must be like
Madonna, enthused by Kaballah or whatever (I so wanna try that) and
their children's children are these Jews who are "returning".</p>
<p>Some even converted for tactical reasons, Asimov:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>About 600 C.E., the Khazars, lived in what is now southern
Russia. They established an empire that reached its peak about 750
C.E., [and] about that time, the Khazars adopted Judaism as the stat
religion, [probably] to keep from falling under the influence of
either the Byzantine Christians or the Arab Moslems</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ROFL. Where is the culture?  Where is "heritage"? You convert to
<em>tactical</em> reasons? And some of the descendants of these people come
to the region and push Palestenians off their land? Dam.</p>

<p>Here's a simple way that can happen..  Let's say u dont want to wait
for 1, 2, or 8 hrs to charge. Then u say "we'll just have a swap
mechanism, u give your empty one, get a charged one". Right there, you
just doubled the amount of lithium needed bcz on top of the lithium
needed for cars, now u need just as much lithium for bats that are
waiting, offline to be picked up in case of a swap.</p>
<p>"But doubling the usage of lithium for transport does not seem likely,

<p><a href="../../2021/01/stats.html#t3mff">FRED graph</a>, 3-month treasury and FEDFUNDS
differential.</p>
<p>When the difference is out of whack, it can be a signal things are
about to go kaboom.</p>
<hr />
<p>Since IR is a short term rate, it would be logical to assume the
instrument that is effected by IR the most can be a predictor of
it. This is the 3-month treasury bill, something the market constantly
votes on with their money. The paper below suggests 3-month treasury
price has some predictive value. </p>
<p>"This paper shows that the spread between the 3-month Treasury bill and
the federal funds rate has significant predictive power for the future
change in the federal funds rate during the volatile nonborrowed
reserves operating regime, but it has less and no predictive power
during the borrowed reserves regime and the federal funds targeting
regime, respectively. These findings suggest that Treasury bill rates
forecast future federal funds rates most accurately when the Federal
Reserve follows a well-defined rule that does not smooth the impact of
shocks on the federal funds rate"</p>
