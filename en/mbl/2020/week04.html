the sum did not change much indicating shared votes base (one's loss
other's gain). Guy is a pro, thinking empirically - always looking for

<p>It does feel like yellow vest movement is not claimed by any

<p>Likely true - protests revolve around social state being rolled back -

in the first place? Is the left too far gone to accept someone who
clearly was overtly pro-business ?</p>
<p>"2018 ...Macron made reforms to the national railway system .. [t]he
reforms ended railway workers‚Äô entitlement to life employment and
special retirement benefits, leading the railway workers of the once
communist Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail to call a series of
rolling strikes spread out over three months. Macron refused to
surrender to the workers‚Äô demands, and the strike was a total
failure. This defeat of a classic working-class tactic no doubt fed
the frustration that would produce the yellow vest movement...</p>
<p>The anger of those living in the French periphery is so deep, issues
from so many different layers of society... The left [has no answers]
for one of the workers and shopkeepers. A seething anger has finally
exploded, and the left is no longer its vehicle or interpreter. The

<p>TR approach, similar. I talked abt nat narrative claiming ppl are from
Central Asia (!). That past was constructed - after "Otto" lost
Balkans, ME, you kinda need your past to come from "somewhere
else". Then, when the new state needs secularism (read: not-Islam),
all of a sudden these mythical ancestors are following some
shamaninism, praying to cat and dogs, porcupine, hyena... whatever's
walking around basically. This is utilitarian
history (re)construction.</p>
<hr />
<p>Whole lota utilitarianism. The past changes according to what is
needed today. That's why ordinary Russkies know "<a href="../../2014/10/alex.html">the real version vs
the state</a> version" on any topic.</p>
<p>"Putin has made a series of statements that Poland started World War
II, and that the Hitler-Stalin pact was forced on Russia by British
and French deals with Germany. The substance of the statements is not
worth debating; the Hitler-Stalin pact was no ordinary alliance, but a
treaty by which Germany and the Soviet Union would together invade and
divide Poland, which they proceeded to do. The claim that Poland
started the war mirrors Hitler‚Äôs claim that Poland was invaded to
protect Germans from Polish brutality...</p>
<p>In making this charge, Putin is trying to cleanse Russia of
responsibility for the war. By claiming that Poland, in some way,
forced the Russians and Germans to invade Poland, he portrays Russia
as an unqualified victim. In doing so, he reaches out to far-right
forces in Europe who have argued that Hitler was forced into war. This
is politically important. The European right has risen, and a segment
of it wants to rewrite history. The Russians have toyed with
supporting a rising right wing for years, and this places Russia in
that position. Putin is claiming that it was not the totalitarians but
the liberal democracies that started World War II, and that therefore
the liberal democracies‚Äô claim to moral superiority is false" --

<p>Prototech AS. A Norwegian company. First time I am hearing of these
guys. They will install an ammonia fuel-cell on the ship. Good to know
this tech is (or will be soon) available. Will it do H2 conversion first?</p>
<p>"A maritime innovation project looking to install the world‚Äôs first
ammonia-powered fuel cell on a vessel has been awarded ‚Ç¨10m funding
from the European Union.</p>
<p>The ShipFC project is being run by a consortium of 14 European
companies and institutions, co-ordinated by the Norwegian cluster
organisation NCE Maritime CleanTech, and has been awarded backing from
the EU‚Äôs Research and Innovation programme Horizon 2020 under its Fuel
Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU).</p>
<p>The project will see an offshore vessel, Viking Energy, which is owned
and operated by Eidesvik and on contract to energy major Equinor, have
a large 2MW ammonia fuel cell retrofitted, allowing it to sail solely
on the clean fuel for up to 3,000 hours annually. As such the project
will demonstrate that long-range zero-emission voyages with high power
on larger ships is possible.</p>
<p>The goal is also to ensure that a large fuel cell can deliver total
electric power to shipboards systems safely and effectively. This is
the first time an ammonia-powered fuel-cell will be installed on a
vessel.  A significant part of the project will be the scale up of a
100-kilowatt fuel cell to 2 megawatts. The fuel cell is tested on land
in a parallel project and development and construction will be
undertaken by Prototech"</p>

the excerpt), their SC ordered the country‚Äôs government to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, but then it expanded the state's
responsibility to emissions even beyond its borders:</p>
<p>"The limited partial responsibility of the Dutch State in relation to
the global climate problem does not relieve the State of the duty of
care it bears: The government had explicit duties to protect its
citizens‚Äô human rights in the face of climate change".</p>
<p>What does that mean? That means any company even a few steps removed
from the their econ could be held liable for their emissions now, and
fall under reg scrutiny. EU GND follows the same spirit.</p>

<p>Funny story: Kurt Godel, the famous logician and Einstein's friend,
discovered a loophole in US Constitution that could allow tyranny to
be legal before his oath of citizenship. He wanted to confront the gov

<p>DM had some influence on Brexit - he helped UKIP for messaging.</p>
<hr />
<p>There is usually a Chinese Wall btw media manipulators / others in
admins. Manipulators aren't good for much else. This is an emotionally
combustible job, if a candidate is elected, they wont be involved with
execution. G. Stephananaopopopoplous, Bannon couldn't do it, even
Carville. Hell he even lost his predictive mojo shortly after Clinton,
he kept banging on how Romney was a huge threat for Bam.</p>
<p>During Clint yrs he brought in Dick Morris, many in WH were revolted,
but he delivered. DM is all about the media play.</p>
<hr />
<p>The war room concept in politics is related to culture code / media
manipulation.</p>
<p>Campaign managers nowadays are always chosen from among ppl who know
how things "play" in the media / voters' emotional brain - much stronger
than atomic issues.</p>
<hr />
<p>The forager vs modern man / farmer analysis appears in a few sources,
but each enmeshed with other things, with some "unnecessary"
noise. Ian Morris buried the main message in a book abt the West and
the Rest, in an analysis on who is up who is down. Chris Ryan talks
about polygamy, monogamy at some length. Hariri gets into this
national narrative business which in terms of origin and priority is
essentially wrong.</p>
<p>So the British is obsessed about class, the American about sex, and
the Israeli about nationhood. Culture polluting analysis. When I
detect this, I remove that part of the message from the rest. It is
basically noise, culture talking, not the brain.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why the MAX debacle? Here is what happened - Boeing was gettting its
ass kicked by Airbus. I was following this race on and off, few years
ago, they were at loggherheads, then I got the impression that somehow
Boeing pulled through. It turns out that "somehow" was the MAX. But
basically Boeing delivered that plane by cutting corners which that
later became the product's undoing.</p>

<p>How is a card game an example of flipped classroom? </p>
<p>Flipped classroom should be about total absence of "teaching" unless
they are asked abt something - so in essence they would not be a
teacher, they would be some sort of guide. Curriculum makes lots of
material available, among which one package becomes official, cleared
by DoED. The guide is certified on that, can answer questions on
it. The "games" if there are any, can be described in the material but
not enforced.</p>
<p>"[Teacher] thought she had the day‚Äôs lesson clinched. Her general
chemistry class at Central New Mexico Community College was going to
play a card game as a way of illustrating reaction rate
principles. She‚Äôd taught this course many times before, using a
‚Äúflipped‚Äù classroom format, and this exercise was always well
received.</p>
<p>Except that day in fall 2014 it wasn‚Äôt. The students didn‚Äôt grasp the
rules; they didn‚Äôt understand how the card game was connected to
reaction rates; they weren‚Äôt in the mood to play games. Concentration
slipped. Several students left early. ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòWow, that worked
three times, but now it doesn‚Äôt work at all; how very interesting.‚Äô
Just because it works for one group doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going to work
for another,‚Äù [she] recalls.</p>
<p>For educators who teach using the flipped classroom model‚Äîin which
students watch lectures online before class and then engage in
practical activities during class time to help cement concepts- [her]
experience is familiar"</p>
