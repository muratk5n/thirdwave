<p>The "store front" of the prog left became "too diverse", too
non-American in terms of others' perception. There are some fine
people there, no doubt, most are culturally American, but the message
should not be "multi-racial" which communicates "diversity for the f-k
of it", it is "we don't give an eff what your ethnicity is". Have to
strike a balance. Too multi-racial can put off whites, too Latin might
put off blacks.</p>
<hr />
<p>The left needs to drop its need for orgasm from people agreeing with
them (also the turn-off they get from disagreement). "Agreement" on
issues might not equate to electoral success. Watch hot button issues,
even create them, get elected. Then implement issues and be judged on
the success of them.</p>

<p>Atomic issues did not matter much, M4A, soc security, previous

issue, personality, and previous experience. Trump beat Hillary,

<p>Another point here is IN came to the possession of bunch of paper to
write on. IMO this was key - in computer science the only difference
between two computing machines, finite-state automata, and the Turing
machine is an (infinite) tape. The latter is the basis of all
computing, more powerful, because it can write and
<strong>remember</strong>. Essentially modern computing, and perhaps human adv
thinking, is largely based on writing, we can achieve by <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mblum/research/pdf/grad.html">a

<p>So the plague at the time helped Newton become what he is. Plague was
raging outside he was studying. If this WuFlu gets worse maybe we'll
get some good scientists out of it?</p>
<p>Gleick, <em>Isaac Newton</em>: "[Then] came the epidemic.  Three men in
London succumbed in a single house; by January the plague, this
disease of population density, was spreading from parish to parish,
hundreds dying each week, then thousands. Before the outbreak ran its
course, in little more than a year, it killed one of every six
Londoners...</p>
<p>The colleges of Cambridge began shutting down.  Fellows and students
dispersed into the countryside.  Newton returned home. He built
bookshelves and made a small study for himself. He opened the nearly
blank thousand-page commonplace book [empty notebook] he had inherited
from his stepfather and named it his Waste Book. He began filling it
with reading notes. These mutated seamlessly into original research.
He set himself problems; considered them obsessively; calculated
answers, and asked new questions. He pushed past the frontier of
knowledge (though he did not know this). The plague year was his
transfiguration. Solitary and almost incommunicado, he became the
world‚Äôs paramount mathematician"</p>

<p>Here is the idea of interaction for most. Bunch of people standing
around, they come together, and everyone turns to the person to their
right, puts a finger up the ass. Everyone else does the same. Now you
formed a circle, and the circle is <strong>connected</strong>. Then they turn this
circle and start singing Kumbaya... This is the ideal for most people.</p>

<p>Deaths due to war, disease etc are directly proportional to the
density of a population. I wrote about it on 2011,
<a href="../../2011/11/logistic-equation.html">here</a> and <a href="../../2011/12/more-on-logistic-equation.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Logistic equation, the best predictor of population growth, works well
because it includes a death rate inversely proportional to the density
of a population. Density means more butting heads on resources, more
physical interaction that create conditions ripe for war and
disease.</p>
<p>Decrease interaction. The ideal soc for most is still dumb villagers
in their dumb villages worhipping to bones and stray cats, dogs, with
weirdo rituals. We need to get out, sparsely populate the Earth, even
the areas over and under the sea.</p>

<p>Climate skepticism is not a "conservative" position. Being a con has
nothing to do with views on climate. UK cons are pro-climate (we can
thank Thatcher for that). Climate, a secondary issue in terms of
potential agreement, was turned into a primary one to hide the fact
that US became a one-party state. Abortion, guns serve the same
purpose.</p>
<p>UK suffered from one-party-ism too, thanks to "Third Way Blair", but
their cons went berserk in different ways. Anyway, not going into that

<hr />
<p><img width="340" src="twimg/EShll2jXYAELCBo.png"/></p>
<p>If there are infinitely many stars, why isn't our night sky infinitely
bright? Longer form below:</p>
<p>Webb, <em>Where is Everybody</em>: "Suppose the stars are uniformly
distributed throughout space. A star‚Äôs brightness decreases as the
square of its distance from an observer, but the number of stars
increases as the square of the distance from the observer. These two
effects cancel, and each grid shown above contributes the same amount
of brightness. Since there is an infinite number of these grids, the
night sky should be infinitely bright. Even allowing for nearby stars
blocking the light from distant stars, the night sky should be
blindingly bright. Why not?"</p>
<p>Answer: "It turns out that the paradox is explained by one of the most
dramatic discoveries ever made by astronomers: the universe has a
finite age. Since the universe is only about 13.8 billion years old,
the part we can see is finite in size. For the night sky to be as
bright as the surface of the Sun, the observable universe would have
to be almost 1 million times bigger than it is"</p>
