<p>The skinny on Lebanon among IR types is this; every religious, ethnic
group is represented there. So whenever there is conflict between
those groups on the outside, there is conflict among the same groups
on the inside. IOW the situtation in Lebanon is fragile, the setup is
ready to blow, bcz of those groups. Who, which, when; that's like
trying to guess which water molecule will crystallize first in water
when temparature is lowered. Some see that event as a surprise,
"tipping point", an unexpected event; the truth of the matter is temp
is low, and at some point, no matter which part of the water
crystallizes first, the whole thing will turn to ice.</p>

<p>IMO this quantum stuff is a waste of time for Google. This is the sort
of work gov funds. It is very possible the whole thing is a crock,
and might not bring any benefit to any company in near future.</p>
<p>"In this paper I want to present to you my theory explaining why
computationally superior quantum computing is not possible, discuss
the laws of nature that may support this theory, and describe some
potential connections and applications. .. [T]ghe assertion of a paper
published in <em>Nature</em> in October 2019, declaring that 'quantum
computational supremacy' was achieved by a team from Google on a
53-qubit computer, seems to refute my argument. We will describe and
give a preliminary evaluation of Google‚Äôs claims. ...</p>
<p>My argument against quantum supremacy and quantum error-correction
Here, in brief, is my argument against quantum computers. ...</p>
<p>(A) From the perspective of computational complexity theory, noisy
intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) circuits are low-level classical
computational devices.</p>
<p>(B) Therefore, by naturalness, NISQ systems do not support quantum
supremacy. In other words, the rate of noise cannot be reduced to the
level allowing quantum supremacy.</p>
<p>(C) Achieving good-quality quantum error-correction requires an even lower noise rate
than the one required for achieving quantum supremacy.</p>
<p>(D) Therefore, NISQ systems do not support quantum error-correction.</p>
<p>(E) Hence, large-scale quantum computing based on quantum
error-correction is beyond reach"</p>
