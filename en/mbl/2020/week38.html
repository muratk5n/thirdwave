overturn federal rules on leaks of natural gas, a major contributor to
climate change. Their message: The companies had emissions under
control.</p>
<p>In private, the lobbyists were saying something very different.</p>
<p>At a discussion convened last year by the Independent Petroleum
Association of America, a group that represents energy companies,
participants worried that producers were intentionally flaring, or
burning off, far too much natural gas, threatening the industry‚Äôs
image, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by The New
York Times.</p>
<p>'We‚Äôre just flaring a tremendous amount of gas,' said Ron Ness,
president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, at the June 2019
gathering, held in Colorado Springs. 'This pesky natural gas,' he
said. 'The value of it is very minimal,' particularly to companies
drilling mainly for oil.</p>
<p>A well can produce both oil and natural gas, but oil commands far
higher prices. Flaring it is an inexpensive way of getting rid of the
gas"</p>
