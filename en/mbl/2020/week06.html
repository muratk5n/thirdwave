<p>Yes there is such a thing as low-information voter. I have to add
though, almost <strong>all</strong> voters are low-information voters. Econ
recently started talking abt a similar concept, i.e. individual actors
lacking information, so cannot make rational decisions, there are now
behavioural economists so forth. Austrians too have a few things to
say on this issue (so they have their moments when they are not busy
shoving a goldbar up their ass). People don't know shit so cannot act
rationally in econ. Why do some ppl assume otherwise in politics? It
is a single, simple decision is based on very rough perceptions, their
own pocketbook, few other traits, in the aggregate works better than
the alternatives. That's it.</p>

<p>Most features attributed to subcultures, say, in the positive, is
placebo. Keep saying "my people" are [certain way], u can start acting
that way, bcz u'd be pushing self as such. It has been proven in the
