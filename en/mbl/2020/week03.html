<p>New grand theory cannot have background dependence (omnipresent
coordinate system) at any level, including the quantum. If 1 says "but
at that scale it doesnt matter" by definition 1 is accepting that
background-dependent QM is a mere approximation. Approx is fine
obviously for computation - but at a foundational level it is not.</p>

<p>OK.. they come here, following this shamanism.. But there are farmers,
peasants in Anatolia. What happens when these cultures mix? It gets
weird at this point. Say people are wondering around and see a
goat. They immediately worship the goat. Then they are fuckin' it. Now
the goat's confused. Sometimes he is up, sometimes he is down... It's
a roller coaster. He just wants to be a goat, go about his day, walk
around, eating his grass.. But these humans are doing strange things
to him. He didn't sign up for that.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some buffoons in TR are like "tigger came from Central Asia" (complete
bull). Who were these people? They say they were following a sort of
of naturalistic religion, some kind of shamanism.. So they prayed to
cats and dogs and shit. Like, a cat comes over and says "meow", you
have to bow down <em>immediately</em> and say "your wish is my command my
Lord". That's how the system works.</p>

<p>Ah of course - that's why he didnt tie the red headband this
time. This is a more mature Rambo. Previously he was kinda gung-ho
about war.</p>
<p>#lastBlood</p>
<hr />
<p>In other movies Rambo was fighting sure, but he was still up in other
people's business, like in Afganistan etc. For the first time he was
"defending his home -the only legitimate case for war really-", like
the Vietnamese, with tunnels. Like I said, full circle. A grown-up
Rambo in some ways.</p>
<p>#lastBlood</p>
<hr />
<p>No tying of the red headband this time?</p>
<p>How is this a Rambo movie? I need to see the headband tying
scene. There was the ammo preperation scene, great. No headband scene.</p>
<p>#lastBlood</p>
<hr />
<p>How come the bad guys keep charging? YOu had to see Rambo is loaded
for bear and waiting for you. After the second tree trunk with nails,
u shoulda said 'f--k this, im getting the f--k outa here'</p>
<p>(But of course they kept going, and they are all dead)</p>

<hr />
<p>So basically in the last Rambo movie, Rambo becomes Vietnamese,
fighting through all those tunnels... I guess the character came full
circle - from PTSD after Vietnam to Vietnamese himself. </p>

<p>Exec ability is most easily proven through service in goverment
(contrary to pop belief, it still matters). Boris J was not too suave
but he is enough of oaf, with some presence, and was the mayor of a
large city once. If that managerial skill is seen on media, that is
okay too; people saw Trump acting as an executive on a show, that was
good. Hell, the current Ukrainian President merely <em>played</em> a
President on TV, even that was proof enough of managerial ability.</p>

<p>Yes. See the same video.</p>
<p>"Are deep nets (that is, their objective functions for data fitting)
non-convex?"</p>
<hr />
<p>DL increases the parameter space to millions, billions - these params
create many optimal points that are equivalent, giving more chances
to the optimizer to reach them. See <a href="https://youtu.be/8zdo6cnCW2w?t=1050">Le Cun</a></p>
<p>"How can deep net models manage to find a model at all?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Most popular approaches in derivative-free opt break the optimization
into many steps, in each step they solve a convex problem. So u still
need to know about convex approaches.</p>
<p>"But Convex problems are so weak.. I hear all action is in non-Convex
problems.."</p>

<p>Much to dissect when it comes to protests in Iran &amp; Iraq but it’s now
clear the fallout over Soleimani’s death will not silence or stifle
critics of the regime. There won’t be a rally-around-the-flag
effect. Protesters have proven to be more resilient than initially
anticipated"</p>
