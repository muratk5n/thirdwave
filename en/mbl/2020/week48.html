<p>I knew there was something behind this interest, other than the art
piece itself. There is nothing special about the piece really. </p>
<p>"Before its theft [in 1911], the 'Mona Lisa' was not widely known
outside the art world. Leonardo da Vinci painted it in 1507, but it
wasn't until the 1860s that critics began to hail it as a masterwork
of Renaissance painting. And that judgment didn't filter outside a
thin slice of French intelligentsia. ...</p>
<p>After the Louvre announced the theft, newspapers all over the world
ran headlines about the missing masterpiece.</p>
<p>'60 Detectives Seek Stolen 'Mona Lisa,' French Public Indignant,' the
New York Times declared. The heist had become something of a national
scandal.</p>
<p>'In France, there was a great deal of concern that American
millionaires were buying up the legacy of France ‚Äî the best
paintings,' Dorothy Hoobler says. At one point, American tycoon and
art lover J.P. Morgan was suspected of commissioning the theft. Pablo
Picasso was also considered a suspect, and was questioned.</p>
<p>And as tensions were escalating between France and Germany ahead of
World War I, 'there were people who thought the Kaiser was behind it,'
Hoobler says"</p>

<p>90/00s vs 10s scifi differences? During the 90s the enemy was "out

<p>10s scifi is more desparate, evil is at home, people are being
exploited by other people, and the victim / heroes are increasingly
extremely young, just kids mostly. <em>The Maze</em>, <em>Hunger Games</em>, or the

<p>Rapaport, <em>The Art of Molecular Dynamics Simulation</em>: "Modeling of
matter at the microscopic level is based on a comprehensive
description of the constituent particles. Although such a description
must in principle be based on quantum mechanics, MD generally adopts a
classical point of view, typically representing atoms or molecules as
point masses interacting through forces that depend on the separation
of these objects. More complex applications are likely to require
extended molecular structures, in which case the forces will also
depend on relative orientation. The quantum picture of interactions
arising from overlapping electron clouds has been transformed into a
system of masses coupled by exotic ‚Äòsprings‚Äô. The justification for
this antithesis of quantum mechanics is that not only does it work,
but it appears to work surprisingly well; on the other hand, the
rigorous quantum mechanical description is still hard pressed in
dealing with even the smallest systems"</p>

involved, but there are many places to do that. For pairwise
