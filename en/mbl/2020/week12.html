<p>I just got off the phone with former Bush NEC Director Larry
Lindsey. He says everyone is missing the ‚Äúbig bazooka‚Äù in the Senate
bill- massive payroll relief for small businesses in section 1105. He
says it could impact up to 80 MILLION American jobs.</p>
<p>Lawrence Lindsey says the section provides loans to small businesses
to cover payroll, and hugely incentivizes them not to lay anyone
off. The measure:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>covers employees making up to $100,000 per year</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>loans forgiven ENTIRELY after 4 months if companies don‚Äôt lay anyone off"</p>

<p>Seeing more teachers putting up online lectures is great. This needs
to be the norm from now on, but content is worked on offline,
beforehand, and always available. No more wait for a content release.
Every last vestige of synchronization should be removed from the
system. No need for "immediate connection" with students, they wait
for nothing, teachers don't rush, 'the lecture' is always on.</p>
<p>Some teachers might have an issue with that especially if they have a
personality defect whereby through "standing up and delivering" in
front of others they get their identity confirmed. We shouldnt create
a whole bloody system around such deficiencies. A "consultant" for
questions here and there is very different from creator / performer /
grader of all things.</p>

<p>"A normal or up-sloped yield curve indicates yields on longer-term
bonds may continue to rise, responding to periods of economic
expansion. When investors expect longer-maturity bond yields to become
even higher in the future, many would temporarily park their funds in
shorter-term securities [buying them decreasing yield] in hopes of
purchasing longer-term bonds later [selling them increasing yield,
difference, the curve goes higher] for higher yields...  In a rising
interest rate environment, it is risky to have investments tied up in
longer-term bonds".</p>

<p>Another good metric - total market cap to GDP (idea from
<a href="https://twitter.com/NorthmanTrader/status/1239871604190064643">here</a>)</p>
<p>Basically your stock market cannot be worth more than the economic
value you are creating (GDP) - so anything above 100% for this metric
is a bubble. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketcapgdp.asp">Investopedia</a>:
"To calculate the total value of all publicly traded stocks in the
U.S., most analysts use The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, which is
an index that represents the value of all stocks in the
U.S. markets. The quarterly GDP is used as the denominator in the
ratio calculation".</p>
<p>I belive this is also called the Buffett Indicator. Wilshire Index
from <a href="../../2021/01/stats.html#wilshire">FRED</a> seems to capture it. </p>
<p>I don't know about anyone else, but post 2016 looks like a freaky bubble. </p>

<p>The project described below is <strong>huge</strong>. California will store H2 "in
vast underground caverns the size of the Empire State Building". It is
known that salt caverns can store H2 for long periods of time. Cal
will get renewable electricity from Utah, and other places through a
few high-voltage lines, it will use them to generate H2. Why do that?
Because renewable source can be intermittent (hence the need for
storage).</p>
<p>How to go from H2 back to electricity again in order to distribute it
within the state? Here LADWP will use gas turbines that take H2 as
fuel, and generate electricity. Turbines will be built by Mitsubishi.</p>
<p>Article says "each salt cavern will hold 5,500 tonnes of H2, enough to
fill up a million fuel cell vehicles, representing storage 84 times
greater than a 1.2GWh battery, according to LADWP"</p>
<p>There is no way to reach this scale, in any shape or form, other than
through renewable fuels.</p>

<p>"Brave [creators of a private Web browser] has filed a formal GDPR
complaint against Google for infringing the GDPR ‚Äúpurpose limitation‚Äù
principle. Enforcement would be tantamount to a functional separation
of Google‚Äôs business...</p>
<p>The GDPR purpose limitation principle requires that organizations
internally ring-fence personal data and use it only for the narrow
purpose it was collected for. Brave‚Äôs evidence shows that Google‚Äôs
internal data free-for-all is unlawful"</p>

<p>This is incorrect. The latest death rate 7.3% is much larger than 1
divided by 700,000 (chances of getting hit by lightning)</p>
<p>"It is more likely to get hit by lightning than dying of coronavirus"</p>

<p>Papua New Guinea: on my map PNG island had no corona on the east
(divided by straight line). The west had some color - so apparently
the Western part is Indonesia, the eastern part is PNG, the country.</p>

<p>Even the econ morons finally figured this out, in their

<p>Why do earlier primaries effect later primaries? Why did Clyburn's
endorsement matter so much? Dont people intelligently judge policies,
on their own, and decide?</p>
<p>No. People don't know <strong>shit</strong>. They are effected by others, especially
leaders. Rightfully so too. Do I know about dentristy? Bee-keeping? No.</p>
