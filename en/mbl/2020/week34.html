there today.</p>
<p>Wolfram on Feynman: "Some scientists (myself probably included) are
driven by the ambition to build grand intellectual edifices. I think
Feynman—at least in the years I knew him—was much more driven by the
pure pleasure of actually doing the science. He seemed to like best to
spend his time figuring things out, and calculating. And he was a
great calculator. All around perhaps the best human calculator there's
ever been.</p>
<p>He always just used regular calculus and things. Essentially
nineteenth-century mathematics. He never trusted much else. But
wherever one could go with that, Feynman could go. Like no one else"</p>

<hr />
<p>Our uni legend had it one our CS profs, my Alg I teacher as it turns
out, had code in Mathematica. He worked with SW's ppl I think. During
lecture he'd slip up sometimes and say "cellular automata" when it was
totally unrelated so we guessed this was his area of research. The
area attracted some smart people is what Im trying to say.</p>
<hr />
<p>Stephen Wolfram might have something promising; starting from
computation, emergent physics cld be possible.. You'd hear things abt
his group over the years, one mathematician I know stumbled upon an
invention that had to do solving PDEs using cellular automata, and he
was piled on by Wolfram's people, even threathening legal action for a
patent issue?  Anyway, u gotta be wary of these kind of motherfonkers

<p>I guess that makes sense, elastic body cld be seen as fluid with a few
constants changed.</p>
<p>Solids are fluids that dont move much?</p>
<p>Or elasticity is left-over fluidicity in solids?</p>

<p><em>The Atlantic</em>: "By the end of March, Mina had identified a culprit:
'There’s little ability for a central command unit to pool all the
resources from around the country,' he said at a Harvard event. 'We
have no way to centralize things in this country short of declaring
martial law.' It took several more months for him to find a solution
to this problem, which is to circumvent it altogether. In the past
several weeks, he has become an evangelist for a total revolution in
how the U.S. controls the pandemic. Instead of restructuring daily
life around the American way of testing, he argues, the country should
build testing into the American way of life. The wand that will
accomplish this feat is a thin paper strip ... It is a coronavirus
test.</p>
<p>Mina says that the U.S. should mass-produce these inexpensive and
relatively insensitive tests—unlike other methods, they require only a
saliva sample—in quantities of tens of millions a day. These tests,
which can deliver a result in 15 minutes or less, should then become a
ubiquitous part of daily life .. The tests Mina describes already
exist: They are sitting in the office of e25 Bio, a small start-up in
Cambridge, Massachusetts; half a dozen other companies are working on
similar products"</p>

<p>Truman was <strong>not</strong> a simple farmer. Politicians might allow such
things to be said abt themselves or even help spread the commentary to
help their "man of the people" image. Reality is different. Truman had
lots of experience before he became President. County judge, Civil
Works admin, Senator, worked at a high-profile commitee, Vice
President, <em>then</em> Potus.</p>
<p>"But anyone can serve at the highest office look at Truman he was a
simple farmer"</p>

was physically carried into a car, he raised his hand in a

<p>"'What I’ve noticed is that, as opposed to everything I’ve done my
entire career, the biggest difference is that in the future there will
be no lines on the battlefield,' Gen. John Hyten, vice chairman of the
[JCS], said.... Hyten who will be a keynote speaker at September’s
Defense News Conference — laid out a vision in which every force can
both defend itself and have a deep-strike capability to hold an enemy
at bay, built around a unified command-and-control system.</p>
<p>'A naval force can defend itself or strike deep. An air force can
defend itself or strike deep. The Marines can defend itself or strike
deep,' he said. 'Everybody.'</p>
<p>That 'everybody' includes international partners, Hyten added, as the
U.S. operates so often in a coalition framework that this plan only
works if it can integrate others"</p>
