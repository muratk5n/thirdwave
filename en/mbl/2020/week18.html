<p>BTW - who names a health insurance after one of the most deadliest
snakes in the world? These ppl are psychopaths.</p>
<hr />
<p>I was thinking M4A a good compromise solution for affordable and
humane care but maybe UK method is even better (all health is managed
directly by gov, reports to PM). Johnson keeps saying how they work
hard to flatten the curve bcz "we had to prevent our NHS from being
overwhelmed" - now that's a thing a politician can observe and
optimize on, bcz it is directly under their purview in UK, which it
turns out to be something useful for the populace at large. It is
always good to have the right incentives in place... So pol can do
things to protect NHS which in turn protects the public.</p>
<p>In US federal pols could be like ... meh.. I dont know.. there are
bunch of hospitals out there and stuff, ppl can go there.. and like,
fend for themselves? And we'll, like, save COBRA or something.. Just
wave a hand and dismiss the problem bcz it doesnt effect any
bureucracy they control directly.</p>
<p>I am not saying pols necessarily dont care for people, but in some
instances it is not clear what to <strong>do</strong> about the problem, which
gears to <strong>turn</strong> to cause change. For UK it is very simple - protect
NHS. Expand NHS - if necessary. I am sure they have a lively research
arm and can put out some good solutions - well, that's great. Help NHS
to research, or coordinate research with others, unis so forth. The
research results too can then be used directly, through NHS, wout this
talk of patents, executive orders, etc. During the time of emergency
it is beyond distasteful to hear of this stuff.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, the U.S. student loan bubble temporarily lowered
the unemployment rate: many people who couldn't find jobs after the
Great Recession simply took on a ton of student loans and went back to
school. Voil√† - they no longer counted as unemployed! It's magic!"</p>

<p>"An NBER paper issued last year concluded that changes to federal
student loans are more than sufficient to explain tuition increases at
private nonprofit colleges...</p>
<p>Unlike most other student loan programs, PLUS loans are not
capped‚Äîparents may borrow up to the cost of attendance, which is
determined by the college. This creates incentives for colleges to
increase student charges, since the federal government will make sure
all eligible parents have access to the money"</p>

<p>If Germany borrows money on capital markets, including from wealthy
Italians, and then channels that money to Italy by way of the EU
budget what does it amount to? A eurobond but one controlled by
Germany! Great from @KeineWunder"</p>
<hr />
<p>"[T]here is another viewpoint [different from electric grids] from
which these possible new electric-power-demand-boosting developments
do not look such good news. It‚Äôs based on a rival assessment of what
makes sense in terms of meeting energy needs ‚Äî the use of gas as an
energy vector. This option is claimed to be more efficient and less
costly than electricity for heating, and possibly for other purposes.</p>
<p>It is certainly easier to transmit gas with lower energy losses. And
it can be stored, unlike electricity"</p>

<p>Yes some countries in fact do not allow free camping. This needs to
change.</p>
<p>"[Autotranslated] According to the World Bank, over 77 percent of
people in Germany live in cities. And these cities don't offer enough
space for everyone. If the Germans who love to travel stay in the
country this summer, .. there will be even less free terrain left
here, the double arm length will be a distant dream. Nature waits in
front of the city: forest and agriculture make up over 80 percent of
land use in Germany.</p>
<p>The townspeople just have to go outside. Not to the eternally the same
and soon overcrowded destinations such as Bastei Bridge, Drachenfels
or the Travem√ºnder Ostseestrand, but in the nameless and contagious
forest, in the Weserbergland, the Elfringhauser Switzerland or the
Fl√§ming.</p>
<p>It is therefore necessary to allow wild camping in the country. The
Scandinavian right of public could serve as a model: The allemansr√§tt
, as it is called in Sweden, not only allows free access to nature -
this is also known as the "right of access" in Germany. It also allows
camping in the wild and only imposes restrictions, such as a minimum
distance from the sleeping area to houses"</p>
