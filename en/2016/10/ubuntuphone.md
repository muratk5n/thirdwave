# #ubuntuphone

Now that's what Im talkin'bout. Saw it at an electronic store today, 

So this device offers an environment closer to my development style than, say, Android, with layers of motherf**ing Java, and other bloat that I do not want or need (iOS is already out of the question). If I were to develop a vision application to be sold, I'd package it on this or a similar phone to be bought and resold by me.
