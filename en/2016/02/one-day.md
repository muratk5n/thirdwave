# One Day

.. I was walking on 5th Avenue New York and... I really had to
go. Really bad. You know, #2. "Red Alert", if u know what I mean. I
looked around, "The Trump" Tower was nearby, so I went in to make use
of their "facilities". I said to myself, "maybe I should take a
Leonardo di Caprio" in here... I could not decide. Then I
said.. "maybe I should take a William Shatner". But no no, I was now
in Trump Tower, so I have to take a **TRUMP**. A big **TRUMP**. So I did it. I
dropped it in there man.. Boom! It felt so good... This place was
weird by the way; I think the sh..ters were gold plated. I am not
joking, it's either that or some other weirdly shiny material,
everything was so bright, like, you can't look directly at them, they
are blinding your eyes. Freaky environment.
