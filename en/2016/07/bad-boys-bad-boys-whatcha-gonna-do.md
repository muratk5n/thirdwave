# Bad Boys, Bad Boys, Whatcha Gonna Do?

Great segment from PBS - Policing the Police

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/policing-the-police/

And.. whenever I hear bad news about police matters, [this
song](https://youtu.be/GazE8PAL-DE?t=23) always plays in my
head.. From the 90s reality TV show COPS. Interesting show to watch,
but I wonder if it helped or hindered the discussion on policing. Did
the public ponder what was being shown, or simply laugh at it, at this
spectacle of an human affair?
