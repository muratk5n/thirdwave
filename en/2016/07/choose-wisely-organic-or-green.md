# Choose Wisely: Organic or Green?

[A report] shows that milk and dairy production is a major source of
greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). A litre of organic milk requires 80
per cent more land than conventional milk to produce, has 20 per cent
greater global warming potential, releases 60 per cent more nutrients
to water sources, and contributes 70 per cent more to acid rain [..].

Organic potatoes use less energy in terms of fertiliser production,
but need more fossil fuel for ploughing. A hectare of conventionally
farmed land produces 2.5 times more potatoes than an organic one [..].

Food scares are always good news for the organic food industry. The
Soil Association and other organic farming trade groups say
conventional food must be unhealthy because farmers use
pesticides. Actually, organic farmers also use pesticides. The
difference is that "organic" pesticides are so dangerous that they
have been "grandfathered" with current regulations and do not have to
pass stringent modern safety tests [..].

The proponents of organic food – particularly celebrities, such as
Gwyneth Paltrow, who have jumped on the organic bandwagon – say there
is a "cocktail effect" of pesticides. Some point to an "epidemic of
cancer". In fact, there is no epidemic of cancer. When
age-standardised, cancer rates are falling dramatically and have been
doing so for 50 years [..].

Hohenheim University [research states]: "[There are no] clear
conclusions about the quality of organic food can be reached using the
results of present literature and research results." What research
there is does not support the claims made for organic food [..].
