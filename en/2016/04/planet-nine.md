# Planet Nine

Strong evidence for the existence of a ninth planet (9th because the
previous 9th, Pluto, was demoted). Fascinating stuff.. It takes P9
almost 20,000 years to go around the sun. Some also claim (backed up
by reputable research) thatÂ this planet passes through a region of
space full of icy objects every 27 million years, knocking them
towards the Earth, creating mass extinction events. It seems space
travel is not a luxury, it's a necessity.
