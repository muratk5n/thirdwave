A solar-powered airplane reached the San Francisco Bay area and performed a fly-by over the Golden Gate Bridge on Saturday afternoon, some 56 hours after leaving Oahu as part of its journey around the world.

Solar Impulse 2 took off from Kalaeloa Airport early Thursday morning.

“I crossed the bridge. I am officially in America,” pilot Bertrand Piccard declared as he flew over the iconic span as spectators watched the narrow aircraft with extra wide wings from below.
