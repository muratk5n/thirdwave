Good slogan. Though outstanding student debt is  around 1 Trillion $
and 4 billion probably wont make a dent in it, this is still a good
place as any to start. I like how the petition is framed; no money to
oilmen, but to education. Petition says:

Every year, billions of dollars in taxpayer money goes to subsidize
one of the most profitable industries in human history: the oil
industry. In 2014 alone, oil companies received more than $4 billion
from US taxpayers, despite raking in hundreds of billions of dollars
in profits. Meanwhile, we have a student debt crisis in our
country. Millions of Americans face mountains of debt to get the
education needed to make a good living.  It’s time to shift our
priorities. We should be making college more affordable, not lining
the pockets of the oil industry. 

Nice.

BTW: According to IEA unless fossil fuel subsidies are cut, countries
will not reach their climate goal targets. 

Note: I did a joke way back saying things like "taking a Leonardo di
Caprio" and "taking a William Shatner", etc... I have to make it clear
I was just joking, I have no problem with these people. Leo is a great
guy in fact, he does a lot publicity work on climate related issues.
