# Ascribe

Consider the music industry, where intermediaries capture nearly all the value and artists get paid last. Now, companies like Mycelia, founded by Grammy-winning artist Imogen Heap, have developed intelligent songs with smart contracts built in, which enable artists to sell directly to consumers without going through a label [..]

Blockchain technology provides a new platform for creators [..] to get the value they create. Consider the digital registry of artwork, including the certificates of authenticity, condition, and ownership. A new startup, Ascribe, which runs on the blockchain, lets artists themselves upload digital art, watermark it as the definitive version, and transfer it, so similar to bitcoin, it moves from one person’s collection to another’s.[..]

Most so-called sharing economy companies are really service aggregators. They aggregate the willingness of suppliers to sell their excess capacity (cars, equipment, vacant rooms, handyman skills) through a centralized platform and then resell them to users, all while collecting a cut off the top [..] Blockchain technology can provide the suppliers of these services a means to collaborate that delivers a greater share of the value to them.  Just about everything Uber does could be done by smart agents on a blockchain.

I favor "monetary likes" that are in small amounts and can be sent to verified identities electronically (given by ppl who have enough $$ to give) for art that is copied freely - but the ideas above are interesting. De-centralizing the work of aggregators sounds great.
