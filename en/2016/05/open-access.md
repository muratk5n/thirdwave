# Open Access

In what European science chief Carlos Moedas calls a "life-changing"
move, European Union member states today agreed on an ambitious new
open access (OA) target. All scientific papers should be freely
available by 2020, the Competitiveness Council—a gathering of
ministers of science, innovation, trade, and industry—concluded after
a 2-day meeting in Brussels[..]

The OA goal is part of a broader set of recommendations in support of
Open Science, a concept which also includes improved storage of and
access to research data. The Dutch government, which currently holds
the rotating E.U. presidency, had lobbied hard for Europe-wide support
for Open Science, as had Carlos Moedas, the European Commissioner for
Research and Innovation.
