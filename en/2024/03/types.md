Control Freak

CF phsychology is that of a monk who lived in a convent all his life,
then all of a sudden *gets out*. They controlled all their emo, lived
with *discipline*, now they are out in a world of lots of
choice. Their path is to deal with that, cant go back to convent,
can't control, obviously you need to control some aspects of your
life.. they need to find a middle ground, and learn to let go.

High Horse

HH is a king / queen who should not be. The hidden desire is to be
loved, madly, by people, and by a significant other, while this
happens they want to be at the center stage, they get all this looove,
adulation, they're under the spotlight, there are all these idiots
around clapping madly, it's like so awesome.

But this is exactly what they need to get away from. HH needs to
connect to others, noticing others' importance, and try to make
decisions that are optimal for the group. See the equality in men. An
oft observed attribute of this profile is a want for excessive risk
taking, in gambling, in love, or in other areas (I guess the way a
king would). They have melodramatic tendencies, can also display
arrogant responses, but don't be confused, they will largely stem from
fear. So; wanting to be loved, be affirmed, while wanting to feel
special is an inborn feature, also the negative direction.
