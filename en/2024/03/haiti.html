<h1>Haiti</h1>
<p>Leslie Mullin, HAC</p>
<p>In 1987, [new junta leader supported by US] Namphy received IMF loans
valued at $24.6 million in exchange for agreeing to slash rice tariffs
from 150% to 50%, the lowest in the Caribbean. He opened all of
Haiti’s ports to commercial activity and agreed to stop what little
support the government had offered Haitian farmers. Meanwhile, Haiti’s
military elite saw an opportunity to make a profit smuggling American
rice.. In the United States, the passage of the 1985 Farm Bill
significantly boosted subsidies to American rice growers. By 1987, 40%
of American rice growers' profits came from the government. Heavily
subsidized American rice could sell at prices far below the market
value of Haitian rice. Haitian farmers never stood a chance against
this unfair competition".. In Haiti, imported American rice is called
'Miami rice' because it is shipped from Miami in sacks stamped 'Miami,
FLA.' By December 1987, Haiti’s rice production had shrunk to 75% of
Haitian needs</p>
<p>Peter James Hudson, Harvard</p>
<p>James Weldon Johnson boarded a.. steamship.. on February 27, 1920,
tasked by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People to investigate conditions in Haiti under US military rule..
[he] published his findings in the Nation as the four-part report
<em>Self-Determining Haiti</em> [where] Johnson’s assessment of the US
occupation (1915–1934), by then in its fifth year, was searing..</p>
<p>For Johnson a single institution and a single individual were
responsible for the US intervention: the National City Bank of New
York - the precursor to the contemporary financial services leviathan
Citigroup - and its vice president Roger Leslie Farnham... [he wrote]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[T]o understand why the United States landed and has for five years
maintained military forces in that country, why some three thousand
Haitian men, women, and children have been shot down by American
rifles and machine guns, it is necessary, among other things, to know
that the National City Bank of New York is very much interested in
Haiti. It is necessary to know that the National City Bank controls
the National Bank of Haiti and is the depository for all of the
Haitian national funds that are being collected by American
officials, and that Mr. R. L. Farnham, vice-president of the National
City Bank, is virtually the representative of the State Department in
matters relating to the island republic"</p>
