# The Bermuda Triangle

The claim is there are mysterious accidents under the so-called
Bermuda Triangle, then there must be more accidents in the aid
area. We looked at the ship accidents to confirm. The data comes from
US Coast Guard, the "Marine Casualty & Pollution Data for Researchers"
[1,2]. We plotted accidents in the BT in one color, others (a bigger
region) in a different color. As concluded in [2] there doesn't appear
to be any glaring patterns.

A statistical test could take the bigger area divided in smaller
regions and count the accidents in each, and get counts in the same
region without ones in BT. Are both counts the same Poisson
distribution?
