# Bermuda

Are accidents more frequent, or outside the pattern inside the
so-called Bermuda triangle? We looked at the ship accidents. The data
comes from US Coast Guard, called "Marine Casualty & Pollution Data for
Researchers" [1]. The idea is from [2], as that example plotted accidents
in the BT one color, others (a bigger region) a different color.

As concluded in [2] there doesn't appear to be any glaring patterns.
