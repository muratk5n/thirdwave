Some excerpts from the video

"I don't know how many of you believe that the Higgs boson was the
discovery of the century but what is sure that Einstein, Dirac, or
Schrodinger would have considered this discovery as ridiculous they
would never have believed that such a model with so many unexplained
parameters reflecting anything fundamental.

So I'm going to argue that particle physics as practice since 1930 is
a futile enterprise in its entirety. ...

First of all good physics is simple, and the true revolutions in
physics always simplify the laws of nature. Maxwell's electrodynamics
was a revolution because the electrodynamic constants and the speed of
light were condensed in one formula, eliminating one constant of
nature.  So did the Planck constant h simplify the laws of nature and
Newton's Theory of Gravitation condensed dozens of unexplained
parameters into one gravitational constant.

[Today's] particle physics is going the other way around. It produced
[too many free] parameters"

More Unzic comments; Robert Dicke rediscovered relativity with
corrections (1957), speed of light should not be constant.

Knowledge

Even scientists themselves take lots of knowledge as given. So
scientist who does additional research thinking black holes exists,
has not independently verified it, or questioned if they exist.. The
danger here is you can pile shit upon shit until stuck or the whole
thing collapsing on itself.

New Direction

His idea for the new direction of physics involves quaternions.

From [The Mathematical Reality Why Space and Time are an Illusion](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematical-Reality-Space-Time-Illusion/dp/B0849ZXQB1):
"As early as the 1930s, the Dutch physicist and close friend of
Einstein, Paul Ehrenfest, wondered why the wave functions for matter
(complex numbers) and light (vector fields) were mathematically so
different. The importance of this profound question is still
underestimated today. If one follows the mission to explain natural
phenomena in a unified picture, light and matter must be contained in
a single formalism. This means that there has to be a mathematical
object that on the one hand, must be a little more complicated than
vectors and complex numbers, but on the other hand must incorporate
their properties...

Hamilton..  one of the most brilliant mathematicians of all time
.. started to study complex numbers. If it was possible to define a
multiplication in two dimensions in such an amazing way, was it also
possible in three dimensions?... On 16 October 1843, while walking
along the Royal Canal in Dublin, Hamilton finally came up with the
answer. In three dimensions it was indeed impossible; but at that
moment, he realized that the tricky multiplication of complex numbers
could be transferred to a four-dimensional number system called
quaternions that had three imaginary units $i$, $j$, $k$ instead of
just one $i$. Whether Hamilton could already have imagined the
fascinating rotations that occur in this number system, we do not
know. In any case, overjoyed at his idea, he carved the constituting
equations into a stone of a nearby bridge

$$
i^2 = k^2 = j^2 = i \cdot j \cdot k = -1
$$

... If we come back to the philosophical question of what mathematical
structure could potentially describe all physical phenomena,
quaternions are a strikingly simple possibility. Since they contain
both complex numbers and conventional vectors as a subset,
quaternions, in principle, can represent all the number systems
physicists have used in their description of the elementary phenomena
light and matter"
