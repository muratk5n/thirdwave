<h1>Seeing Red</h1>
<p>Book by Halton Arp</p>
<p>One useful aspect of the present book is that it illustrates what can
develop from one simple assumption, such as the nature of
extragalactic redshifts. Both sides in the dispute have complex,
rather fully worked out views which they believe to be empirically
supported and logically required. Yet one side must be completely and
catastrophically wrong. It makes one wonder, perhaps with profit,
whether there are other uncertain assumptions on which much of our
lives are built, but of which we are innocently overconfident...</p>
<p>It is currently believed that rigorous cosmology started in the early
1920’s after Einstein wrote down the equations of general
relativity. These essentially represented the conservation of mass,
energy, momentum, etc. in the most general possible coordinate
system. In 1922, the Russian mathematician, A. Friedmann, “solved”
these equations, i.e., showed how the system would behave in time. It
is interesting to note that at first, Einstein felt this solution was
incorrect. Later he said it was correct, but of no
consequence. Finally he accepted the validity of this solution, but
was so unhappy with the fact that it was not a stable solution, i.e.,
it either collapsed or expanded, that he retained the cosmological
constant he had earlier introduced in order to keep the universe
static. (This constant was later referred to as the cosmological fudge
factor.)</p>
<p>In 1924, Hubble persuaded the world that the “white nebulae” were
really extragalactic, and a few years later announced that the
redshifts of their spectral lines increased as they became
fainter. This redshift-apparent magnitude relation for galaxies became
known as the Hubble law (through lack of rigor, often referred to as
the redshift-distance relation). At this point Einstein dropped his
cosmological constant as a great mistake, and adopted the view that
his equations had been telling him all along, that the universe was
expanding. Thus was born the Big Bang theory, according to which the
entire universe was created instantaneously out of nothing 15 billion
years ago.</p>
<p>This really is the entirety of the theory on which our whole concept
of cosmology has rested for the last 75 years. It is interesting to
note, however, that Hubble, the observer, even up to his final lecture
before the Royal Society, always held open the possibility that the
redshift did not mean velocity of recession but might be caused by
something else...</p>
<p>I think it is a supreme and delicious piece of irony that 85 years
after the Director at Lick Observatory announced the K effect Margaret
Burbidge, a senior professor at the University of California, went up
Mount Hamilton on a winter night to that same Lick Observatory. She
observed two quasars that all the biggest and most advanced telescopes
in the world had deliberately refused to look at, and in so doing,
solved the riddle of the K effect—and at the same time laid the last
flower on the grave of Big Bang cosmology.</p>
<p>Looking back now... we can see that if the relativists had heeded the
published observations, going back a decade before their theoretical
revelations, perhaps they would have decided that the universe was not
necessarily exploding away from us in all directions...</p>
<p>My career at the Observatories in Pasadena slightly overlapped Edwin
Hubble’s.  He personally gave me my first job: to aid in determining
the crucial distance scale in cosmology...</p>
<p>The greatly publicized theory is black holes where everything falls
in. But the observations show everything falling out!..</p>
