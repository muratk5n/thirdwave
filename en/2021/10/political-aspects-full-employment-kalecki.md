# Political Aspects of Full Employment

From the Kalecki 1943 paper, [PDF](https://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/~mshalev/ppe/Kalecki_FullEmployment.pdf)

A solid majority of economists is now of the opinion that, even in a
capitalist system, full employment may be secured by a Government
spending programme, provided there is in existence adequate plant to
employ all existing labour power, and provided adequate supplies of
necessary foreign raw materials may be obtained in exchange for
exports.

1) If the Government undertakes public investment (e.g. builds
schools, hospitals, and highways) or subsidises mass consumption (by
family allowances, reduction of indirect taxation, or subsidies to
keep down the prices of necessities), if, moreover, this expenditure
is financed by borrowing and not by taxation (which could affect
adversely private investment and consumption), the effective demand
for goods and services may he increased up to a point where full
employment is achieved. Such Government expenditure increases
employment, be it noted, not only directly but indirectly as well,
since the higher incomes caused by it result in a secondary increase
in demand for consumption and investment goods.

2) It may be asked where the public will get the money to lend to the
Government if they do not curtail their investment and consumption. To
understand this process it is best, I think, to imagine for a moment
that the Government pays its suppliers in Government securities. The
suppliers will, in general, not retain these securities but put them
into circulation while buying other goods and services, and so on
until finally these securities will reach persons or firms which
retain them as interest-yielding assets. In any period of time the
total increase in Government securities in the possession (transitory
or final) of persons and firms will be equal to the goods and services
sold to the Government. Thus what the economy lends to the Government
are goods and services whose production is "financed" by Government
securities. in reality the Government pays for the services not in
securities but in cash, but it simultaneously issues securities and so
drains the cash off; and this is equivalent to the imaginary process
described above.

What happens, however, if the public is unwilling to absorb all the
increase in Government securities ? It will offer them finally to
banks to get cash (notes or deposits) in exchange. If the banks accept
these offers, the rate of interest will be maintained. If not, the
prices of securities will fall, which means a rise in the rate of
interest, and this will encourage the public to hold more securities
in relation to deposits. It follows that the rate of interest depends
on banking policy, in particular on that of the Central Bank. If this
policy aims at maintaining the rate of interest at a certain level
that may be easily achieved, however large the amount of Government
borrowing. Such was and is the position in the present war. In spite
of astronomical budget deficits, the rate of interest has shown no
rise since the beginning of 1940.

3) It may be objected that Government expenditure financed by
borrowing will cause inflation. To this may be replied that the
effective demand created by the Government acts like any other
increase in demand. If labour, plant. and foreign raw materials are in
ample supply, the increase in demand is met by an increase in
production. But if the point of full employment of resources is
reached and effective demand continues to increase, prices will rise
so as to equilibrate the demand for and the supply of goods and
services. (In the state of overemployment of resources such as we
witness at present in the war economy, an inflationary rise in prices
has been avoided only to the extent to which effective demand for
consumption goods has been curtailed by rationing and direct
taxation.) It follows that if the Government intervention aims at
achieving full employment but stops short of increasing effective
demand over the full employment mark, there is no need to be afraid of
inflation.

1) The above is a very crude and incomplete statement of the economic
doctrine of full employment. But, I think, it is sufficient to,
acquaint the reader with the essence of the doctrine, and so enable
him to follow the subsequent discussion of a the political problems
involved in the achievement of full employment.

It should be first stated that although most economists are now agreed
that full employment may be achieved by Government spending, this was
by no means the case even in the recent past.  Among the opposers of
this doctrine there were (and still are) prominent so called "economic
experts" closely connected with banking and industry. This suggests
that there is a political background in the opposition to the full
employment doctrine even though the arguments advanced are
economic. That is not to say that people who advance them do not
believe in their economics, poor though these are. But obstinate
ignorance is usually a manifestation of underlying political motives.

There are, however, even more direct indications that a first class
political issue is at stake here. In the great depression in the
thirties, big business opposed consistently experiments for increasing
employment by Government spending in all countries, except Nazi
Germany. This was to be clearly seen in the U.S.A.  (opposition to the
New Deal), in France (Blum experiment) and also in Germany before
Hitler. The attitude is not easy to explain.  Clearly higher output
and employment benefits not only workers, but entrepreneurs as well,
because their profits rise. And the policy of full employment outlined
above does not encroach upon profits because it does not involve any
additional taxation. The entrepreneurs in the slump are longing for a
boom; why do not they accept gladly the "synthetic" boom which the
Government is able to offer them? It is this difficult and fascinating
question with which we intend to deal in this article.

The reasons for the opposition of the "industrial leaders" to full
employment achieved by Government spending may he subdivided into
three categories: (i) the dislike of Government interference in the
problem of employment as such; (ii) the dislike of the direction of
Government spending (public investment and subsidising consumption);
(iii) dislike of the social and political changes resulting from the
maintenance of full employment. We shall examine each of these three
categories of objections to the Government expansion policy in detail.

2) We shall deal first with the reluctance of the "captains of
industry" to accept Government intervention in the matter of
employment. Every widening of State activity is looked upon by
"business" with suspicion, but the creation of employment by
Government spending has a special aspect which makes the opposition
particularly intense. Under a laisser-faire system the level of
employment depends to a great extent on the so-called state of
confidence. If this deteriorates, private investment declines, which
results in a fall of output and employment (both directly and through
the secondary effect of the fall in incomes upon consumption and
investment). This gives to the capitalists a powerful indirect control
over Government policy: everything which may shake the state of
confidence must be carefully avoided because it would cause an
economic . crisis. But once the Government learns the trick of
increasing employment by its own purchases, this powerful controlling
device loses its effectiveness. Hence budget deficits necessary to
carry out Government intervention must be regarded as perilous. The
social function of the doctrine of "sound finance" is to make the
level of employment dependent on the "state of confidence."

3) The dislike of the business leaders , of a Government ' spending
policy grows even more acute when. they come to consider the objects
on which the money would be spent: public investment and subsidising
mass consumption.

The economic principles of Government intervention require that public
investment should be confined to objects which do not compete with the
equipment of private business (e.g.  hospitals, schools, highways,
etc.). Otherwise the profitability of private investment might be
impaired and the positive effect of public investment upon employment
offset by the negative effect of the decline in private
investment. This conception suits the business men very well. But the
scope of public investment of this type is rather narrow, and there is
a danger that the Government, in pursuing this policy, may eventually
be tempted to nationalise transport or public utilities so as to gain
a new sphere in which to carry out investment.

One might therefore expect business leaders and their experts to be
more in favour of subsidising mass consumption (by means of family
allowances, subsidies to keep down the prices of necessities, etc.)
than of public investment; for by subsidising consumption the
Government would not be embarking on any sort of "enterprise." In
practice, however, this is not the case. Indeed; subsidising mass
consumption is much more violently opposed by these "experts"
than. public investment. For here a "moral" principle of the highest
importance is at stake. The fundamentals of capitalist ethics require
that "You shall earn your bread in sweat"—unless you happen to have
private means.

4) We have considered the political reasons for the opposition against
the policy of creating employment by Government spending. But even if
this opposition were overcome—as it may well be under the pressure of
the masses—the maintenance of full employment would cause social and
political changes which would give a new impetus to the opposition of
the business leaders.  Indeed, under a regime of permanent full
employment "the sack" would cease to play its role as a disciplinary
measure. The social position of the boss would be undermined and the
self assurance and class consciousness of the working class would
grow. Strikes for wage increases and improvements in conditions of
work would create political tension. It is true that profits would be
higher under a regime of full employment than they are on the average
.under laisser-faire; and even the rise in wage rates resulting from
the stronger bargaining power of the workers is less likely to reduce
profits than to increase prices, and thus affects adversely only the
rentier interests. But "discipline in the factories" and "political
stability" are more appreciated by the business leaders than profits.
Their class instinct tells them that lasting full employment is
unsound from their point of view and that unemployment is an integral
part of the " normal " capitalist system.

1) One of the important functions of fascism, as typified by the Nazi
system, was to remove the capitalist objections to full employment.

The dislike of Government spending policy as such is overcome under
fascism by the fact that the State machinery is under the direct
control of a partnership of big business with fascist upstarts.  The
necessity for the myth of "sound finance," which served to prevent the
Government from offsetting a confidence crisis by spending, is
removed. In a democracy one does not know what the next Government
will be like. Under Fascism there is no next Government.

The dislike of Government spending, whether on public investment or
consumption, is overcome by concentrating Government expenditure on
armaments. Finally, "discipline in the factories" and "political
stability" under full employment are maintained by the " new
order,' which ranges from the suppression of the trade unions to the
concentration camp. Political pressure replaces the economic pressure
of unemployment.

2) The fact that armaments are the backbone of the policy of fascist
full employment has a profound influence upon its economic
character. Large-scale armaments .are inseparable from the expansion
of the armed forces and the preparation of plans for a war of
conquest. They also induce competitive rearmament of other
countries. This causes the main aim of the spending to shift gradually
from full employment to securing the maximum effect of rearmament.  As
a result. employment becomes "overfull"; not only is unemployment
abolished but an acute scarcity of labour prevails.  Bottlenecks arise
in every sphere and these must be dealt with by creation of a number
of controls. Such an economy has many features of a "planned economy,"
and is sometimes compared, rather ignorantly, with socialism. However,
this type of "planning" is bound to appear whenever an economy puts
itself a certain high target of production in a particular sphere,
when it becomes . a "target economy" of which the "armament economy"
is a special case. An "armament economy" involves in particular the
curtailment of consumption as compared with what it could have been
under full employment.

The fascist system starts from the overcoming of unemployment,
develops into an "armament economy" of scarcity, and ends inevitably
in war.

1) What will be the practical outcome of the opposition to "full
employment by Government spending" in a capitalist democracy ? We
shall try to answer this question on the basis of the analysis of the
reasons for this opposition given in section II. We argued that we may
expect the opposition of the " leaders of industry " on three planes :
(i) the opposition on principle against Government spending based on a
budget deficit; (ii) the opposition against this spending being
directed either towards public investment—which may fore-shadow the
intrusion of the state into the new spheres of economic activity—or
towards subsidising mass consumption; (iii) the opposition against
maintaining full employment and not merely preventing deep and
prolonged slumps.

Now, it must be recognised that the stage in which the "business
leaders" could afford to be opposed to any kind of Government
interventions to alleviate a slump is rather a matter of the past.
Three factors have contributed to this: (a) very full employment
during the present war; (b) the development of the economic doctrine
of. full employment ; (c) partly as a result of these two factors the
slogan "Unemployment never again" is now deeply rooted in the
consciousness of the masses. This position is reflected in the recent
pronouncements of the "captains of industry" and their experts. The
necessity that if something must he done in the slump" is agreed to;
but the fight, continues, firstly, as to "what should be done in the
slump" (i.e. what should be the direction of Government intervention),
and secondly, that "it should be done only in the slump" (i.e. merely
to alleviate slumps rather than to secure permanent full employment).

2) In the current discussions of these problems there emerges time and
again the conception of counteracting the slump by stimulating private
investment. This may be done by lowering the rate of interest, by the
reduction of income tax, or by subsidising private investment directly
in this or another form. That such a scheme should be attractive to
"business" is not surprising.. The entrepreneur remains the medium
through which the intervention is conducted. If he does not feel
confidence in the political situation he will not be bribed into
investment. And the intervention does not involve the Government
either in "playing with" (public) investment or "wasting money" on
subsidising consumption.

It may be shown, however, that the stimulation of private investment
does not provide an adequate method for preventing mass
unemployment. There are two alternatives to be considered here. (a)
The rate of interest or income tax (or both) is reduced sharply in the
slump and increased in the boom. In this case both the period and the
amplitude of the business cycle will be reduced, but employment not
only in the slump but even in the boom may be far from full, i.e. the
average unemployment may be considerable, although its fluctuation.,
will be less marked. (b) The rate of interest or income tax is reduced
in a slump but not increased in the subsequent boom. In this case the
boom will last longer but it must end in a new slump: one reduction in
the rate of interest or income tax does not, of course, eliminate the
forces which cause cyclical fluctuations in a capitalist economy. In
the new slump it will be necessary to reduce the rate of interest or
income tax again, and so on. Thus in not too remote a time the rate of
interest would have to be negative and income tax would have to be
replaced by an income subsidy. The same would arise if it were
attempted to maintain full employment by stimulating private
investment: the rate of interest and income tax would have to be
reduced continuously.

In addition to this fundamental weakness of combating unemployment by
stimulating private investment, there is a practical difficulty. The
reaction of the entrepreneurs to the measures described is
uncertain. If the down-swing is sharp they may take a very pessimistic
view of the future, and the reduction of the rate of interest or
income tax may then for a long time have little or no effect upon
investment, and thus upon the level of output and employment.

3) Even those who advocate stimulating private investment to
counteract the slump frequently do not rely on it exclusively but
envisage that it should be associated with public investment. It looks
at present as if " business leaders" and their experts (at least part
of them) would tend to accept as a pis aller public investment
financed by borrowing as a means of alleviating slumps. They seem,
however, still to be consistently opposed to creating employment by
subsidising consumption and to maintaining full employment.

This state of affairs is perhaps symptomatic of the future economic
regime of capitalist democracies. In the slump, either under the
pressure of the masses, or even without it, public investment financed
by borrowing will be undertaken to prevent large scale
unemployment. But if attempts are made to apply this method in order
to maintain the high level of employment reached in the subsequent
boom a strong opposition of "business leaders " is likely to be
encountered. As has already been argued, lasting full employment is
not at all to their liking. The workers would "get out of hand" and
the "captains of industry" would be anxious to "teach them a lesson."
Moreover, the price increase in the up-swing is to the disadvantage of
small and big rentiers and makes them "boom tired."

In this situation a powerful block is likely to be formed between big
business and the rentier interests, and they would probably find more
than one economist to declare that the situation was manifestly
unsound. The pressure of all these forces, and in particular of big
business—as a rule influential in Government departments—would most
probably induce the Government to return to the orthodox policy of
cutting down the budget deficit. A slump would follow in which
Government spending policy would come again into its own.

This pattern of a "political business cycle" is not entirely
conjectural; something very much like that happened in the U.S.A.  in
1937-1938. The breakdown of the boom in the second half of 1937 was
actually due to the drastic reduction of the budget deficit.  On the
other hand, in the acute slump that followed the Government promptly
reverted to a spending policy.

The regime of the "political business cycle" would be an artificial
restoration of the position as it existed in nineteenth century
capitalism. Full employment would be reached only at the top of the
boom, but slumps would be relatively mild and short lived.

1) Should a progressive be satisfied with a regime of the "political
business cycle" as described in the preceding section ? I think he
should oppose it on two grounds: (i) that it does not assure lasting
full employment; (ii) that Government intervention is tied down to
public investment and does not embrace subsidising consumption. What
the masses now ask for is not the mitigation of slumps but their total
abolition. Nor should the resulting fuller utilisation of resources be
applied to unwanted public investment merely in order to provide
work. The Government spending programme should be devoted to public
investment only to the extent to which such investment is actually
needed. The rest of Government spending necessary to maintain full
employment should be used to subsidise consumption (through family
allowances, old age pensions, reduction in indirect taxation,
subsidising of prices of necessities). The opposers of such Government
spending say that the Government will then have nothing to show for
their money. The reply is that the counterpart of this spending will
be the higher standard of living of the masses. Is not this
the. purpose of all economic activity?

2) "Full employment capitalism" will have, of course, to develop new
social and political institutions which will reflect the increased
power of the working class. If capitalism can adjust itself to full
employment a fundamental reform will have been incorporated in it. If
not, it will show itself in outmoded system which must be scrapped.

But perhaps the fight for full employment may lead to fascism?
Perhaps capitalism will adjust itself to full employment in this way?
This seems extremely unlikely. Fascism sprang up in Germany against a
background of tremendous unemployment and maintained itself in power
.through securing full employment while capitalist democracy failed to
do so. The fight of the progressive forces for full employment is at
the same time a way of preventing the recurrence of fascism.
