# The Entrepreneurial State

Mariana Mazucatto

Using its funding networks, DARPA increased the flow of knowledge
across competing research groups. It facilitated workshops for
researchers to gather and share ideas while also learning of the paths
identified as ‘dead ends’ by others. DARPA officers engaged in
business and technological brokering by linking university researchers
to entrepreneurs interested in starting a new firm; connecting
start-up firms with venture capitalists; finding a larger company to
commercialize the technology; or assisting in procuring a government
contract to support the commercialization process.

Pursuing this brokering function, DARPA officers not only developed
links among those involved in the network system, but also engaged in
efforts to expand the pool of scientists and engineers working in
specific areas. An example of this is the role DARPA played in the
1960s by funding the establishment of new computer science departments
at various universities in the US. By increasing the number of
researchers who possessed the necessary and particular expertise,
DARPA was able, over an extended period of time, to accelerate
technological change in this area. In the area of computer chip
fabrication during the 1970s, DARPA assumed the expenses associated
with getting a design into a prototype by funding a laboratory
affiliated with the University of Southern California. Anyone who
possessed a superior design for a new microchip could have the chips
fabricated at this laboratory, thus expanding the pool of participants
designing faster and better microchips.  The personal computer emerged
during this time with Apple introducing the first one in 1976.
Following this, the computer industry’s boom in Silicon Valley
and the key role of DARPA in the massive growth of personal computing
received significant attention, but has since been forgotten by those
who claim Silicon Valley is an example of ‘free market’ capitalism. In
a recent documentary, Something Ventured, Something Gained, for
example, the role of the State is not mentioned once in the 85 minutes
spent describing the development of Silicon Valley (Geller and
Goldfine 2012)...

[Characteristic] of the DARPA model: A series of relatively small
offices, often staffed with leading scientists and engineers, are
given considerable budget autonomy to support promising ideas. These
offices are proactive rather than reactive and work to set an agenda
for researchers in the field. The goal is to create a scientific
community with a presence in universities, the public sector and
corporations that focuses on specific technological challenges that
have to be overcome.
