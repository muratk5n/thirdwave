An app is not really necessary though,\njust a mobile sized website.  \n  \nA web interface to your own Bitcoin server at home wouldn't be a solution for\neveryone.

While I don't think Bitcoin\nis practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as\nstorage and bandwidth costs continue to fall. If Bitcoin catches on on a big\nscale, it may already be the case by that time. Another way they can become\nmore practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network\nnodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms.\nWhatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. I think in\n5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.  \n  \nI am not claiming that the network is impervious to DoS attack. I think most\nP2P networks can be DoS attacked in numerous ways. (On a side note, I read\nthat the record companies would like to DoS all the file sharing networks, but\nthey don't want to break the anti-hacking/anti-abuse laws.)  \n  \nIf we started getting DoS attacked with loads of wasted transactions back and\nforth, you would need to start paying a 0.01 minimum transaction fee. 0.1.5\nactually had an option to set that, but I took it out to reduce confusion.\nFree transactions are nice and we can keep it that way if people don't abuse\nthem.  \n  \nThat brings up the question: if there was a minimum 0.01 fee for each\ntransaction, should we automatically add the fee if it's just the minimum\n0.01? It would be awfully annoying to ask each time. If you have 50.00 and\nsend 10.00, the recipient would get 10.00 and you'd have 39.99 left. I think\nit should just add it automatically.
