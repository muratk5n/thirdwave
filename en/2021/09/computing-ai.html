<h1>Computing AI</h1>
<p>Recent neural net heavy approaches to "AI" are too dependent on
computation of decisions, not on any underlying model of intelligence.
What is a model? In math teaching, relations, models, functions are
usually conflated. Some call math "the study of patterns" but that
description also falls short..</p>
<p>Imagine the cat's cradle game,</p>
<p><img alt="" src="cradle1.jpeg" /></p>
<p>This is a web of relations. It doesn't necessarily compute anything.
Move one finger that causes changes in other fingers - a relation.
We can <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=18Y1ZXPzI2nRrYyvjYNHiw7xG8cpWQNAU">transform</a>
this model into another one , maybe something simpler, play with it etc.
I could utilize differential calculus, all kinds of odd algebras,
to create this web of relations.</p>
<p>This is not a function. But we can retrieve a function out of this
model, it could be the the function of "going from finger X to finger
Y, while always remaining in the middle". So I specified
initial and boundary conditions, and I received a function, something
computable. $f(x)=2x$ is a function. I plug in $x=2$, it gives me 4.</p>
<p>Let's change the domain, real world, physics, Laplace Equation in 2D
is</p>
<p>$$
\frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial^2 p}{\partial y}  = 0
$$</p>
<p>A very simple, concise model. This approach is used to represent heat
conduction, fluid dynamics, electrostatics.. many areas.</p>
<p>And here is  solution function based on certain initial and boundary conditions.</p>
<p>$$
p(x,y) =
\frac{\sinh \left( \frac{3/2 \pi y}{L_y}  \right)}
     {\sinh \left( \frac{3/2 \pi L_y}{L_x} \right)}
\sin \left( \frac{3/2 \pi x}{L_x}  \right)   <br />
$$</p>
<p>A bloddy mess. It is of course computable.</p>
<p>Then, a relation, a model is much more fundamental, essential
construct. A function, as a solution, can be complicated. When we
model the world, we need to work with the essentials, they are much
more powerful. We invented entire areas of math so we can do this. </p>
<p>Now, current approaches of AI, neural nets, can only see, work with
the computable stuff, with functions. Well actually they cant even get
the analytical mess correctly, they have to approximate it. Both of
these problems now lead us to an odd situation; What we
reverse-engineer from data is not intelligence, only one <em>solution</em> to
an underlying model we know nothing about, and only under certain
conditions. That's why these NNs, deep or otherwise, are tied so much
to data, are fragile, and too dependent on their surrounding
conditions, and fail to generalize.</p>
<p><a name='car'/></p>
<p>But there is more...</p>
<p>What if the data cannot even contain the traces of a function in some
cases? See <a href="http://deepdriving.cs.princeton.edu/paper.pdf">article</a> on
teaching machines how to drive. In order to teach machines how to
drive using pure vision, the system was fed data on controls
(steering, break, acceleration) and images of the outside world, in
pairs. Feed it gazillions of such data, the program will learn the
relation between them and supposed learn how to drive. But the article
makes the case that might not be the best way to learn. Say image X is
given, in it car makes right turn. A similar image Y is given, car
makes a left turn there.. What should the machine learn in this case?</p>
<p>The problem is that there might not be a direct function between
controls and outside images. If the root of science is math, and the
root of math is number theory / sets, a function is a mapping from one
set to another, a one-to-one or many-to-one mapping. If image X
results in left steering, similar image Y in right steering, there is
no function there. 2 + 2 cannot give you 4 and 14 at the same
time. NNs cannot approximate data coming from such process, as they
are not the traces of a function.</p>
<p>So besides approximating functions being the wrong track for AI
research, we also do not have traces of functions in most datasets we
capture. NNs were the lowest fruit in the tree, but to get more fruit,
different tools are required.</p>
<p>Question</p>
<p>In computational science (for physics), we also approximate the
functions generated from the true model</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>Yes but in that case you are going forward from a known model, not
going backward, blindly from data with nothing known. Going forward
with a clean model has its challanges, but we always have a solid
basis, we can make use of that. Plug something into it, might get
certain functions that might be easier etc.</p>
<p>Question</p>
<p>What is the current state of AI research?</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>There are currently no reputable, major work going on for modeling
intelligence. I don't want to say 'we barely scratched the surface'
because noone is even scrathing the surface. All the energy is around
the monkey biz, NNs, data, etc. If you asked me 18th century, 'whats
going on in physics?' I'd have said yeah they are modeling some shit'.
Cant say the same for intelligence.</p>
<p>Question</p>
<p>Then NNs look at a data, like a lot of $(x=2.1,y=4.5)$, $(x=1.9,3.9)$, ..
and try to guess this function is probably $y = f(x) = 2x$?</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>Essentially yes.. They usually don't attempt at the analytical formula,
represent $f(x)$ through a jungle of "neural" connections, at the end
tho they try to reach something akin to a function by looking at data.</p>
<p>Note: They represent functions bcz they need to "run" something for
each data point and see how close they came to the answer (also in
data).  They use that error to adjust the internal jungle of neurons
so next time it is better. </p>
<p>Question</p>
<p>For given IC and BC above, you retrieved a complicated function. But
it's only one, manageable.</p>
<p>Answer</p>
<p>The problem is for slightly different IC/BC you would get completely
different (and just as complicated) function. It is a complete mess to
manage from the other direction. People need to get a paper and pencil
and start thinking things through, at a more fundamental level.</p>
