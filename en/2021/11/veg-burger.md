# Vegetarian Burger

Ingredients (for three patties)

* Parboiled Kidney/White Beans, ~200g in total
* White Rice (1/2 Cup)
* 1/4 Beetroot (grated)
* 1/4 Onions (grated)
* 1 teaspoon marmite
* Spices: Garlic, Salt, Black Pepper, Red Pepper Flakes (a pinch of each)
* Nutritional Yeast (2 Teaspoon)
* Bread crumbs
* 1 Tblspoon Olive Oil
* 3 Tblspoon Musrooms (diced)
* 2 Tblspoon Oatmeal
* 1/2 Tblspoon Wheat Starch

Soften onions and musrooms on a pan. Boil the rice, until its water
evaporates. Add everything along with the beans, and olive oil in a
bowl. Either run it through blender or mash, mix by hand. Should be a
meat like substance by now, easy to shape. Make patties, fry in olive
oil on a pan. Serve in a bun along with garnish (pickles, lettuce).
