Soften onions and musrooms on a pan. Boil the rice, until its water
evaporates. Add everything along with the beans, and olive oil in a
bowl. Either run it through blender or mash, mix by hand. Add
breadcrums until the mix holds it shape. Should be a meat like
substance by now. Make patties, fry in oil on a pan. Serve in a bun
along with garnish (pickles, lettuce).
