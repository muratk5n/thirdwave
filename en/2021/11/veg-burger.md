# Vegetarian Burger

Ingredients (for three patties)

* Spices: Garlic, Salt, Oregano, Mint (a pinch of each)
* Nutritional Yeast (1 Teaspoon)
* Bread crumbs
* 3 Tblspoon Musrooms (diced)

Soften onions and musrooms on a pan. Boil the rice, until its water
evaporates. Add everything along with the beans in a bowl. Either run
it through blender or mash, mix by hand. Should be a meat like
substance by now, easy to shape. Make patties, fry in olive oil on a
pan. Serve in a bun along with cucumber pickles and lettuce.
