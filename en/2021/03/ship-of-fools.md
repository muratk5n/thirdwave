# Ship of Fools

Chavez led the legendary Delano grape
strike, which lasted for five years and inspired college students
across the country to wear 'Boycott Grapes' pins.

Chavez’s signature rallying cry, 'Si, se puede!' ('Yes we can!'),
became so famous among well-educated liberals that Barack Obama used
it as a campaign slogan when he ran for president. Growing up in
California, I can’t remember a year when we didn’t celebrate the life
and achievements of Cesar Chavez in class.  Chavez’s name is still
everywhere in the state. There are six libraries, eleven parks, half a
dozen major roads, and at least twenty-five public schools in
California named after him, more than George Washington. That doesn’t
include the many Cesar Chavez academic buildings, student centers, and
at least one college. Cesar Chavez Day is a California state holiday.

Most enduring is Chavez’s 'Si, se puede!' Wherever left-wing
demonstrators gather, you’ll hear it. It’s most common at
pro-immigration rallies. Several times I’ve seen illegal aliens scream
it while carrying Mexican flags. Every time, I say a silent prayer of
thanks that Cesar Chavez is long dead. It would have been torture for
him.

Cesar Chavez didn’t support illegal aliens. Chavez didn’t like
immigration at all, generally, especially the low-skilled kind. Chavez
understood that new arrivals from poor countries will always work for
less than Americans
