<h1>The Power of Nations</h1>
<p>Michael Beckley </p>
<p>Many scholars and analysts measure power in terms of resources
[1]. Unfortunately, most of them measure resources in gross rather
than net terms. As noted, gross indicators systematically overstate
the power of populous countries, because they count the benefits of
having a big population, but not the costs...</p>
<p>To rank among the most powerful nations in the world, a state needs to
amass a large stock of resources, and to do that a state must be big
and efficient. It must produce high output at low costs. It must not
only mobilize vast inputs, but also produce significant output per
unit of input. In short, a nation’s power stems not from its gross
resources, but from its net resources—the resources left over after
subtracting costs.</p>
<p>In military affairs, production costs refer to the number of assets
needed to generate a given level of force and are mainly a function of
skill and technology—a military with skillful military personnel and
superior technology will use fewer resources to accomplish a mission
than a military with low skill and outdated technology...</p>
<p>Security costs are the price a government pays to police and protect
its citizens. The logic of deducting assets tied up in domestic law
enforcement and homeland security is simple: police and military units
that are bogged down chasing criminals, quelling rebellions, or
defending borders against foreign invasions cannot project power
abroad or create wealth at home. Measuring security costs thus
accounts for the fact that two nations with identical sets of gross
resources may, nevertheless, wield vastly different levels of power if
one country is surrounded by enemies and wracked by internal strife
whereas the other is stable and surrounded by allies...</p>
<p>The most popular indicator is GDP, which records the value of all
goods and services produced within a country over a fixed period of
time... Despite the widespread use of GDP, however, few people know
what it actually measures or recognize that it does not deduct
costs... GDP counts security spending as economic output. GDP does not
distinguish between guns and butter. It counts a 100 million gulag the
same as a $100 million innovation center. Hence, GDP fails to account
fully for the economic costs of domestic instability and international
conflict. In fact, GDP usually rises when a country mobilizes for
war...</p>
<p>Academics, too, typically measure the power of nations in terms of war
potential. As noted, more than 1,000 peer-reviewed studies have used
CINC, which combines data on military spending, troops, population,
urban population, iron and steel production, and energy consumption.
Measures of war potential, however, suffer from the same problem as
GDP: they are gross measures that do not deduct production, welfare,
or security costs. They count military units the same, regardless of
their level of skill or technology, the welfare costs of supporting
those units, or whether they are projecting power abroad or imposing
order at home. They also treat military spending and other inputs,
such as energy consumption or R&amp;D spending, as if they were outputs,
so a country could substantially increase its CINC score by making
enemies and then raising a huge, oil-guzzling army to attack them.</p>
<p>How can scholars address the shortcomings of the standard indicators
of national power discussed above? The ideal solution would be to
deduct costs... The obvious problem with such an approach, however, is
that compiling balance sheets for every country is a painstaking
process that requires substantial data and time... [S]cholars need a
proxy for net resources that has data covering many countries going
back many decades. Does such an indicator exist?</p>
<p>In an oft-cited statistical reference, the historian Paul Bairoch
suggested that the 'strength of a nation could be found in a formula
combining per capita and total GDP.' Bairoch did not elaborate on this
point, but subsequent research supports his intuition: as noted,
scholars already believe that GDP represents the gross size of a
state’s economic and military output, and there is a large literature
showing that GDP per capita serves as a reliable proxy for economic
and military efficiency....</p>
<p>To create a rough proxy for net resources, I follow Bairoch’s advice
by simply multiplying GDP by GDP per capita, creating an index that
gives equal weight to a nation’s gross output and its output per
person. This two-variable index obviously does not measure net
resources directly, nor does it resolve all of the shortcomings of GDP
and CINC. By penalizing population, however, it provides a better
sense of a nation’s net resources than GDP, CINC, or other gross
indicators alone...</p>
<p>UK and China</p>
<p><a name='ukch'/></p>
<p>By standard indicators, China looked like a superpower in the
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It had the largest GDP and
military in the world until the 1890s, and the second largest GDP and
military until the 1930s. During this time, however, China suffered a
“century of humiliation” in which it lost significant territory and
most of its sovereign rights, fighting at least a dozen wars on its
home soil — and losing every single one of them...</p>
<p>Clearly, Britain was more powerful than China during the Opium
Wars. This fact, however, is not captured by standard gross metrics:
China’s GDP and defense budget were more than twice the size of
Britain’s, and China’s army of 800,000 troops dwarfed the 7,000-troop
force that Britain sent to China to fight the wars.</p>
<p>China’s weakness is apparent only when costs are taken into account...
China suffered from greater production, welfare, and security costs
than Britain and thus had fewer resources to draw on in their many
disputes. Whereas Britain comes out far ahead of China when power is
measured by my proxy for net resources (GDP x GDP per capita), Britain
never overtook China in terms of GDP. Moreover, CINC suggests,
nonsensically, that China and Britain were equally matched in the
mid-nineteenth century and that China surpassed Britain in power in
1907, five years before the Chinese government collapsed.</p>
<p>China and Japan</p>
<p>China’s misery did not end with the Opium Wars. In the latter half of
the nineteenth century, Japan became determined not to suffer the same
fate as China, so it revamped its government, economy, and military
and began seizing territory and resources in East Asia. When China
tried to stand in the way of Japan’s imperialist plans, Japan went on
a rampage and quickly defeated China militarily in 1894 and forced it
to sign the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded the Liaodong Peninsula,
Formosa, and the Pescadores to Japan. China also was forced to
recognize Korea’s independence—which effectively meant that Korea
would become a vassal of Japan, no longer of China—and to give Japan
commercial rights in China and a massive indemnity.</p>
<p>After pocketing these gains, Japan annexed Korea in 1910, and when
World War I broke out in 1914, Japan entered the war on the Allies’
side and seized the German-controlled city of Qingdao on China’s
Shandong Peninsula. Japan then presented China with the infamous
“Twenty-One Demands,” which basically called for China to become a
Japanese ward. The United States forced Japan to abandon its most
punishing demands, but Japan still extracted substantial territorial
and economic concessions from China.</p>
<p>A little more than a decade later, Japan expanded its presence in
northeast China, establishing a colony there called Manchukuo in 1932,
and bringing the Chinese provinces of Jehol and Hebei under Japanese
control in 1933. In 1934, the Japanese government declared that East
Asia was Japan’s sphere of influence and warned other great powers not
to defend China. Then in 1937, Japan launched a full-scale invasion.
By the time World War II began in Europe in 1939, Japan controlled
most of eastern China plus Taiwan and its outlying islands. Japanese
expansion stopped only when it ran afoul of the United States, which
decisively defeated Japan in 1945.</p>
<p>Obviously Japan was more powerful than China during their rivalry. Yet
by standard metrics, China appeared to have far greater power
resources. China’s population, GDP, and military were several times
larger than Japan’s, but Japan had greater net resources because it
was much more efficient than China ...</p>
<p><a name='chsuperpower'/></p>
<p>First, an enormous literature in international relations has been
built on a flawed conception of power, so existing studies may need to
be reevaluated with new measures. As noted, more than 1,000
peer-reviewed studies have used CINC to measure power. Yet, this
indicator severely mischaracterizes the balance of power in some of
the most important geopolitical events of the past 200 years. CINC
also suggests, nonsensically, that Israel is, and has always been, one
of the weakest countries in the Middle East; Singapore is one of the
weakest in Southeast Asia; Brazil dominates South America with roughly
five times the power resources of any other state; Russia dominated
Europe throughout the 1990s, with more power resources than Germany,
France, and the United Kingdom combined; and China has dominated the
world since 1996 and currently has twice the power resources of the
United States...</p>
<p>The main evidence typically cited for these trends is China’s rising
GDP and military spending and various statistics that are essentially
subcomponents of GDP—most notably, China’s massive manufacturing
output; volume of exports; trade surplus with the United States;
infrastructure spending; consumer spending; and large government
bureaucracy and scientific establishment.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that these are the same gross indicators that
made China look like a superpower during its century of humiliation:
in the mid-1800s, China had the world’s largest economy and military;
led the world in manufacturing output; ran a trade surplus with
Britain; presided over a tributary system that extended Chinese trade
and investment, infrastructure projects, and soft power across
continental East Asia; and was celebrated in the West for its consumer
market potential and tradition of bureaucratic competence and
scientific ingenuity.</p>
<p>Obviously China is not as weak today as it was in the nineteenth
century, but neither is it as powerful as its gross resources
suggest. China may have the world’s biggest economy and military, but
it also leads the world in debt; resource consumption; pollution;
useless infrastructure and wasted industrial capacity; scientific
fraud; internal security spending; border disputes; and populations of
invalids.. China also uses seven times the input to generate a given
level of economic output as the United States and is surrounded by
nineteen countries, most of which are hostile toward China,
politically unstable, or both.</p>
<p>Accounting for even a fraction of these production, welfare, and
security costs substantially reduces the significance of China’s
rise... if power is measured in terms of GDP or CINC, China already
appears to be the most powerful country in the world; by contrast, if
power is measured with my proxy for net resources or the UN or World
Bank’s measures of net resources ..., then China lags far behind the
United States and looks set to do so for the foreseeable future.</p>
